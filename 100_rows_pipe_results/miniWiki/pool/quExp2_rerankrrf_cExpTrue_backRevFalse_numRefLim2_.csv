If an elephant wants to intimidate a predator or rival, it will spread its ears out wide to make itself look more massive and imposing . During the breeding season, males give off an odour from a gland located behind their eyes . Joyce Poole, a well-known elephant researcher, has theorized that the males will fan their ears in an effort to help propel this ""elephant cologne"" great distances., Context: The large flapping ears of an elephant are also very important for temperature regulation. Elephant ears are made of a very thin layer of skin stretched over cartilage and a rich network of blood vessels  . On hot days, elephants will flap their ears constantly, creating a slight breeze. This breeze cools the surface blood vessels, and then the cooler blood gets circulated to the rest of the animal's body . The hot blood entering the ears can be cooled as much as ten degrees Fahrenheit before returning to the body. Differences in the ear sizes of African and Asian elephants can be explained, in part, by their geographical distribution . Africans originated and stayed near the equator, where it is warmer. Therefore, they have bigger ears. Asians live farther north, in slightly cooler climates, and thus have smaller ears.","1235, 1234",temperature regulation,
