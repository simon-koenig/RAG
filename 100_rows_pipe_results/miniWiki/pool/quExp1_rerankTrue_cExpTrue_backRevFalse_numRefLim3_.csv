Elephants have a very long childhood. They are born with fewer survival instincts than many other animals . Instead, they must rely on their elders to teach them the things they need to know . Today, however, the pressures humans have put on the wild elephant populations, from poaching to habitat destruction, mean that the elderly often die at a younger age, leaving fewer teachers for the young., Context:  The harvest of elephants, both legal and illegal, has had some unexpected consequences on elephant anatomy as well . African ivory hunters, by killing only tusked elephants, have given a much larger chance of mating to elephants with small tusks or no tusks at all . The propagation of the absent-tusk gene has resulted in the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants, now approaching 30% in some populations (compare with a rate of about 1% in 1930), Context:  Elephants are mammals, and the largest land animals alive today.
