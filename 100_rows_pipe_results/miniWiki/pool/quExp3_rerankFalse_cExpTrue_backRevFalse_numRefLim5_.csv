Under the elephant's weight the foot swells, but it gets smaller when the weight is removed . An elephant can sink deep into mud, but can pull its legs out readily  because its feet become smaller when they are lifted, Context:  After a twenty-two-month pregnancy, the mother will give birth to a calf that will weigh about 113 kg (250 lb) and stand over 76 cm (2.5 ft) tall. Elephants have a very long childhood. They are born with fewer survival instincts than many other animals . Instead, they must rely on their elders to teach them the things they need to know . Today, however, the pressures humans have put on the wild elephant populations, from poaching to habitat destruction, mean that the elderly often die at a younger age, leaving fewer teachers for the young, Context: The feet of an elephant are nearly round.

What are the elephant's ears important for?,"The large flapping ears of an elephant are primarily important for temperature regulation. They have a rich network of blood vessels and thin skin, allowing for cooling of the blood by as much as ten degrees Fahrenheit as it circulates through the ears","Context:  The large flapping ears of an elephant are also very important for temperature regulation. Elephant ears are made of a very thin layer of skin stretched over cartilage and a rich network of blood vessels . On hot days, elephants will flap their ears constantly, creating a slight breeze. This breeze cools the surface blood vessels, and then the cooler blood gets circulated to the rest of the animal's body . The hot blood entering the ears can be cooled as much as ten degrees Fahrenheit before returning to the body. Differences in the ear sizes of African and Asian elephants can be explained, in part, by their geographical distribution, Context:  The ears are also used in certain displays of aggression and during the males' mating period. If an elephant wants to intimidate a predator or rival, it will spread its ears out wide to make itself look more massive and imposing .

Generally, pups bark and bark-howl much more frequently than adults, using these vocalizations to cry for attention, care, or food. A lesser known sound is the rally .

Studies also show that wolves howl more frequently during the breeding season and subsequent rearing process  . The pups themselves begin howling soon after emerging from their dens and can be provoked into howling sessions easily over the following two months  . Such indiscriminate howling usually is intended for communication, and does not harm the wolf so early in its life.  Howling becomes less indiscriminate as wolves learn to distinguish howling pack members from rival wolves, Context: Observations of wolf packs suggest that howling occurs most often during the twilight hours, preceding the adults' departure to the hunt and following their return  .

Such indiscriminate howling usually is intended for communication, and does not harm the wolf so early in its life.

Some scientists speculate that such group sessions strengthen the wolves' social bonds and camaraderie similar to community singing among humans  .  During such choral sessions, wolves will howl at different tones and varying pitches, making it difficult to estimate the number of wolves involved.
