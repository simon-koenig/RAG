Beneath the bones of the foot is a tough, gelatinous material that acts as a cushion or shock absorber. Under the elephant's weight the foot swells, but it gets smaller when the weight is removed . An elephant can sink deep into mud, but can pull its legs out readily  because its feet become smaller when they are lifted., Context:  After a twenty-two-month pregnancy, the mother will give birth to a calf that will weigh about 113 kg (250 lb) and stand over 76 cm (2.5 ft) tall. Elephants have a very long childhood. They are born with fewer survival instincts than many other animals . Instead, they must rely on their elders to teach them the things they need to know .

Why is it beneficial for alpha males and females to forcefully prevent other wolves from mating?,"Yes, it's beneficial because a pack can typically only sustain one litter per year. Preventing other matings helps maintain this balance and avoid overpopulation, which could strain the pack's resources.","Context: Generally, mating occurs between January and April â the higher the latitude, the later it occurs.  A pack usually produces a single litter unless the alpha male mates with one or more subordinate females  .

What method is used by Kangaroos to travel?,"Yes, kangaroos use hopping as their primary mode of locomotion. This fast and energy-efficient method allows them to cover large distances in search of food and water, a crucial ability for survival in their native environment.","Context:  A Tasmanian Forester (Eastern Grey) Kangaroo in motion., Context: Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion  . The comfortable hopping speed for Red Kangaroo is about 20 25 km/h (13 16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained, over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for  nearly two kilometres  .    This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators., Context:  Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion .

This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators., Context: A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise have been known to leap in front of cars  .  Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe.  Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage  . The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact.  As a result, ""kangaroo crossing"" signs are commonplace in Australia., Context:  Europeans have long regarded Kangaroos as strange animals. Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers), stood upright like men, and hopped like frogs .  Combined with the two-headed appearance of a mother kangaroo, this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers' tales for quite some time., Context: There is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency  . Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated that, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and that the extra energy is required to carry extra weight  . For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly-sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other continents but economy: in an infertile continent with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival .","1728, 1738, 1738, 1762, 1736, 1752",hopping,
