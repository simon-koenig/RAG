Elephants have a very long childhood. They are born with fewer survival instincts than many other animals . Instead, they must rely on their elders to teach them the things they need to know . Today, however, the pressures humans have put on the wild elephant populations, from poaching to habitat destruction, mean that the elderly often die at a younger age, leaving fewer teachers for the young., Context:  The harvest of elephants, both legal and illegal, has had some unexpected consequences on elephant anatomy as well . African ivory hunters, by killing only tusked elephants, have given a much larger chance of mating to elephants with small tusks or no tusks at all .

What are the elephant's ears important for?,"Yes, the elephant's ears are important for temperature regulation. They consist of a thin layer of skin stretched over cartilage and blood vessels. When an elephant flaps its ears, it creates a breeze that cools the surface blood","Context:  The ears are also used in certain displays of aggression and during the males' mating period. If an elephant wants to intimidate a predator or rival, it will spread its ears out wide to make itself look more massive and imposing .

Mayr 2005) think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three ., Context:  What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and fowl) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl .
