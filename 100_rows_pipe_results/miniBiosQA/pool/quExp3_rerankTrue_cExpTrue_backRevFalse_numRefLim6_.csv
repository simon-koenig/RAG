What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas,","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: Histone lysine methylation is a critical marker for controlling gene expression.  The position and extent of methylation (mono-, di-, or tri-) controls the  binding of effector proteins that determine whether the associated DNA is  expressed or not. Dysregulation of histone protein methylation has been  associated with a number of types of cancer, and development of inhibitors for  the effector proteins is becoming an active area of research. For this reason, understanding the mechanism by which effector proteins obtain selectivity for  the different methylation states of lysine is of great interest. To this end, we  have performed mutation studies on the Drosophila HP1α chromodomain, which binds H3K9Me(2) and H3K9Me(3) with approximately equal affinities. The selectivity of  HP1α chromodomain for H3K9Me(3) over H3K9Me(2) was investigated by mutating E52  to remove or weaken the hydrogen bond to K9Me(2) while maintaining affinity for","23179372, 19270706, 23179372, 23179372, 23179372, 22052799","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"The context does not provide information on which specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulated by SAM68. The text only mentions that SAM68, an RNA binding protein,","Context: various biological processes. Since NONCODE version 3.0 was released 2 years  ago, discovery of novel ncRNAs has been promoted by high-throughput RNA  sequencing (RNA-Seq). In this update of NONCODE, we expand the ncRNA data set by  collection of newly identified ncRNAs from literature published in the last 2  years and integration of the latest version of RefSeq and Ensembl. Particularly,  the number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increased sharply from 73 327 to  210 831. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of  lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs. The 56  018 and 46 475 lncRNA genes were generated from 95 135 and 67 628 lncRNAs for human and mouse, respectively. Additionally, we present expression profile of  lncRNA genes by graphs based on public RNA-seq data for human and mouse, as well  as predict functions of these lncRNA genes.

In this study, we firstly have examined this  punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the  obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs). Sam68,  belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then  confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless,  Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly,  indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71  infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs  formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a  microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that EV71 infections can induce SGs formation, and Sam68, as a SGs component,  migrates alone with SGs dependent on intact microtubule upon the viral  infections.

Isolated ectopia lentis is frequently caused by genetic  alterations as well, most commonly due to mutations in ADAMTSL4. Depending on  the molecular basis, the consequences for the management of patients may differ  significantly: On the one hand, possible accompanying symptoms may require a  specific surveillance and treatment. Also, the risk for other family members to  develop ectopia lentis or accompanying symptoms can only be determined if the  genetic cause and thus inheritance pattern are known. This review describes the  different types and genetic causes of syndromal and isolated ectopia lentis as  well as possible consequences for the patients; also it presents a sensible algorithm for the molecular diagnostic approach., Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context:  Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the  mutations of FBN1 gene. We report on a family with ectopia lentis. The  propositus is a 6-year-old boy with bilateral superior-temporal ectopia lentis. His echocardiogram was normal and he did not meet the revised Ghent criteria for  Marfan syndrome. Molecular genetic testing revealed c.1948 C>T (p.Arg650Cys) in  FBN1. The mother has visual acuity of 20/20 with -4.50 right eye and -2.50 left eye. She has no evidence of ectopia lentis. DNA analysis revealed that she has  the same FBN1 mutation. Seven other maternal family members also have ectopia  lentis. In conclusion, we report on a case of early-onset autosomal dominant, Context: If not due to trauma, ectopia lentis is usually caused genetically. It is a main  symptom of several syndromal disorders such as Marfan syndrome or  homocystinuria. Also other connective tissue disorders convey an elevated risk  for ectopia lentis.

The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes such as transposons to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, in C. elegans, piRNAs interact with both transposon and non-trans","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell  proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile.

Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell","23124062, 18809914, 26279487, 26279487, 26279487, 26279487",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 is a histone methyltransferase that can deposit the H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 histone marks. This information is found in the first context passage, where it","Context: An organism's genome sequence serves as a blueprint for the proteins and  regulatory RNAs essential for cellular function. The genome also harbors  cis-acting non-coding sequences that control gene expression and are essential  to coordinate regulatory programs during embryonic development. However, the  genome sequence is largely identical between cell types within a multi-cellular  organism indicating that factors such as DNA accessibility and chromatin  structure play a crucial role in governing cell-specific gene expression. Recent  studies have identified particular chromatin modifications that define  functionally distinct cis regulatory elements. Among these are forms of histone 3 that are mono- or tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3,  respectively), which bind preferentially to promoter and enhancer elements in  the mammalian genome. In this work, we investigated whether these modified histones could similarly identify cis regulatory elements within the zebrafish  genome. By applying chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing,  we find that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are enriched at transcriptional start sites in, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis.

Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase.

H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro.

Recent evidence suggests that  the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees  of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively  active. Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar  observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting  phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis.  These specific genotype-phenotype correlations in the FGFR disorders seem to be  unprecedented in the study of human disease. The explanation for this high degree of mutability at specific bases remains an intriguing question., Context: common form of human dwarfism. Despite many studies, there is no consensus about  the exact mechanism underlying the pathology. To gain further understanding into  the physical basis behind the disorder, here we measure the activation of  wild-type and mutant FGFR3 in mammalian cells using Western blots, and we  analyze the activation within the frame of a physical-chemical model describing  dimerization, ligand binding, and phosphorylation probabilities within the  dimers. The data analysis presented here suggests that the mutation does not  increase FGFR3 dimerization, as proposed previously. Instead, FGFR3 activity in  achondroplasia is increased due to increased probability for phosphorylation of the unliganded mutant dimers. This finding has implications for the design of  targeted molecular treatments for achondroplasia.","9949234, 10696568, 9949234, 9949234, 10696568, 20624921","Recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R).",8078586

Which is the protein encoded by the human gene GRIK?,"Yes, the human gene GRIK encodes for kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors.

This information is provided in","Context: the genes encoding glandular kallikreins in species evolutionarily located  between rodents and man may reveal interesting details on how the gene family  evolved, which in turn could yield information about the function of the  proteins. Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human  tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in  primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys.

The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor.

In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context: Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to  mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells.  Dysfunction of apoptosis renders the cancer cell resistant to treatment as well  as promotes tumorigenesis. Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane  permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c and consequently cancer cell death. A number of drugs in clinical use are  known to indirectly activate Bax. Intriguingly, recent efforts demonstrate that  Bax can serve as a promising direct target for small-molecule drug discovery. Several direct Bax activators have been identified to hold promise for cancer  therapy with the advantages of specificity and the potential of overcoming  chemo- and radioresistance. Further investigation of this new class of drug, Context: Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins has the ability to  form transmembrane pores large enough to allow cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, as  well as to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP);  however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in some cancers such as NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) and bladder cancer. In NSCLC, it is also associated with metastasis and poor survival","Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis. The identification of MALAT-1 emphasizes  the potential role of noncoding RNAs in human cancer., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors.

Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique  loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of  splicing or gene expression.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, the 3D structure of the genome does not remain stable during cell differentiation. According to the context, substantial remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure occurs during epidermal morphogenesis, a process that is","Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside, Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression.

In this review, we discuss new insights into how the structural  features of the 3D genome hierarchy are established and maintained, how this  hierarchy undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development and how its perturbation will lead to human disease, highlighting the accumulating evidence  that links the diverse 3D genome architecture components to a multitude of human  diseases and the emerging mechanisms by which 3D genome derangement causes disease phenotypes., Context: We argue that the content of the ICD compartment is highly enriched in DNA  depleted biochemical matrix preparations. The ICD compartment may be considered  as the structural and functional equivalent of the in vivo nuclear matrix. A  matrix in this functional sense is compatible with but does not necessitate the  concept of a 3D nuclear skeleton existing of long, extensively arborized  filaments. In the absence of unequivocal evidence for such a structural matrix  in the nucleus of living cells we keep an agnostic attitude about its existence  and possible properties in maintaining the higher-order nuclear architecture.  Quantitative modeling of the 3D and 4D human genome architecture in situ shows that such an assumption is not necessary to explain presently known aspects of  the higher-order nuclear architecture. We expect that the interplay of  quantitative modeling and experimental tests will result in a better understanding of the compartmentalized nuclear architecture and its functional  consequences., Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression.

Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"The two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome are lymphedema of the lower extremities and cholestasis (recurrent jaundice). This is because Aagenaes syndrome, also known as Lymp","Context: Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant  adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological  abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish.

Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, the context provides information about indications for isradipine. Isradipine is indicated for the treatment of mainly mild to moderate hypertension in patients with or without other underlying medical problems. It has been found to be as effective","Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen.

With the reduced  left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the  ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left  ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic  wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The  directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness.

Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context: INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumor in  the pediatric population, accounting for 20-25% of all brain tumors in children.  Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in  medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation. PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the, Context: BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours  affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups.  Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of  tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes  (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput  genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations. Here, we have  mutagenised the Ptch+/- murine tumour model using the Sleeping Beauty transposon  system to identify additional genes and pathways involved in SHH subgroup  medulloblastoma development. RESULTS: Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and  identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically  mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription  factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1  and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes, Context: genetic mechanisms play a role in the activation of PDGFR-RAS/MAPK signalling in  medulloblastoma, we performed a direct sequence analysis of the established  mutational ""hotspots"" of known targets of activating mutations within the  pathway (PDGFRA, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS and BRAF) and PDFRFB, in a cohort of 28  primary tumours. A synonymous sequence variation in PDGFRA (CCG to CCA; PRO 567  PRO) was detected in two cases (approximately 7%), but not in 150 normal  chromosomes assessed, suggesting that the PDGFRA locus may be associated with  medulloblastoma development in certain cases. No evidence for oncogenic  mutations affecting NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or PDFRFB was found in any case. These data demonstrate that activating mutations in established mutational  hotspots within the PDGFR-RAS/MAPK pathway are rare events in medulloblastoma  development, and suggest that alternative mechanisms are responsible for RAS/MAPK pathway activation in this disease., Context: protein-coding genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA profiling of medulloblastomas was carried out using  Taqman Low Density Array v 1.0 having 365 human microRNAs. In parallel,  genome-wide expression profiling of protein-coding genes was carried out using  Affymetrix gene 1.0 ST arrays. RESULTS: Both the profiling studies identified four molecular subtypes of  medulloblastomas. Expression levels of select protein-coding genes and miRNAs  could classify an independent set of medulloblastomas. Twelve of 31  medulloblastomas were found to overexpress genes belonging to the canonical WNT signaling pathway and carry a mutation in CTNNB1 gene. A number of miRNAs like  miR-193a, miR-224/miR-452 cluster, miR-182/miR-183/miR-96 cluster, and miR-148a  having potential tumor/metastasis suppressive activity were found to be overexpressed in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas.

Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regulatory submissions have also been made in the EU and other countries. Phase III development is ongoing  worldwide to evaluate ceritinib both as a first- and second-line therapy for  ALK-positive NSCLC.

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following  reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of  pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two  fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously  produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification  results by calculating the distance heat-map.

In a comparative cross-sectional  reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were  sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating  characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean  receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71,  P = .001). LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy images with accuracy that exceeded some but not all dermatologists., Context:  BACKGROUND: Computer vision may aid in melanoma detection. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare melanoma diagnostic accuracy of computer  algorithms to dermatologists using dermoscopic images. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using 100 randomly selected  dermoscopic images (50 melanomas, 44 nevi, and 6 lentigines) from an  international computer vision melanoma challenge dataset (n = 379), along with individual algorithm results from 25 teams. We used 5 methods (nonlearned and  machine learning) to combine individual automated predictions into ""fusion""  algorithms. In a companion study, 8 dermatologists classified the lesions in the, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and","29047032, 29439500, 29846502, 28969863, 28969863, 29439500","in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a computational tool called SSCprofiler was used to predict novel miRNA precursors. It utilizes a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models and integrates biological features such as sequence, structure","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: microRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their gene targets.

What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?,"Yes, TRH does have a positive inotropic effect on myocardial contractility, as evidenced by its ability to enhance the rate of contraction and relaxation, and increase peak contractile force. However, this effect is concentration","Context: cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7  and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"Yes, the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AATAAA. This consensus was identified as possibly forming ""functional"" signals in the analysis of 12 hexamers and their locations of polyadenylation","Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation., Context: present in the 2092 nucleotide interval. The first one functions as the major  polyA signal, directing cleavage and polyadenylation at a site 20 nucleotides  downstream.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker because it binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells. This property can be used in flow cytometry-based apopt","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin.

The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of, Context:  Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content, Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF  expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells., Context: reliability of this method. By comparing the comet assay with a flow cytometry  method that uses Annexin V binding to apoptotic cells, we have provided further  evidence for evaluating the usefulness of the comet assay for detecting  apoptosis.  METHODS: Apoptosis was induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) by ionizing radiation and measured using the comet assay and a flow  cytometry method that measures Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining.  RESULTS: The Annexin V flow cytometry assay distinguished among early apoptosis,  late apoptosis, and an apoptotic or necrotic phase in which the cells were  labeled with both Annexin V and PI. The comet assay detected only the latter two phases of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The comet assay is a useful tool for measuring the late stages of  apoptosis whereas the Annexin V assay measures higher amounts of apoptosis  because it can detect cells in an earlier stage of the apoptotic pathway.","16331047, 23000925, 9359032, 7812008, 16737615, 12116376","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"
Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"Yes, ultraconserved elements are associated with ESC self-renewal.

These elements have been found to have diverse  functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The  evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined. RESULTS: Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human. In addition to a well-known association with developmental genes, these DNA elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential  cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate  immunity, and sensory reception. Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved, Context: Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating  T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lef1  partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover,  depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs without exogenous factors, cytokines or inhibitors. Transcriptome  resequencing analysis reveals that LEF1 is closely associated with endoderm  specification in ESCs. Thus, our study adds support to the notion that the key, Context: evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined.

In vivo and additional computational studies of UCEs and other highly conserved sequences are consistent with these functional associations,  with some observations indicating enhancer-like activity for these elements.  Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants.

The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching  status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows  analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes., Context: patients from this group and modified the final model into an index scoring  system, the LACE+ index.

Analysis of the model's or variable's discrimination was determined by  the receiver operating characteristic curve as represented by the C-statistic.  RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial  neoplasm (n = 352).

The  interactome is regulated by PARP1 and its co-factor CTCF. They not only mediate  chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is because cells with impaired recombination repair mechanisms, such as homologous recombination repair (HRR), can accumulate DNA damage and gen","Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context: cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,  antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development.

Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB  repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic  integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown  that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper  control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. We developed a novel assay based on recombination between two  Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) sequences in transiently transfected plasmid  DNA. The plasmid construct contains an intact, emission-shifted, ""blue"" variant of GFP (BFP), with a 300 nucleotide stretch of homology to a nonfunctional copy  of GFP. In the absence of homologous recombination only BFP is present, but  homologous recombination can create a functional GFP. The homologous regions in, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs).","12488587, 20298636, 23675572, 23675572, 11178982, 12427531",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, in the context provided, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki include salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1. These genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis in mammals","Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan, Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome. Loss of  endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative,  invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular  apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates.

Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in, Context: The evolution of genomic imprinting in mammals occurred more than 100 million  years ago, and resulted in the formation of genes that are functionally haploid  because of parent-of-origin-dependent expression. Despite ample evidence from  studies in a number of species suggesting the presence of imprinted genes on  human chromosome 14, their identity has remained elusive. Here we report the  identification of two reciprocally imprinted genes, GTL2 and DLK1, which  together define a novel imprinting cluster on human chromosome 14q32. The  maternally expressed GTL2 (gene trap locus 2) gene encodes for a nontranslated  RNA. DLK1 (delta, Drosophila, homolog-like 1) is a paternally expressed gene that encodes for a transmembrane protein containing six epidermal growth factor  (EGF) repeat motifs closely related to those present in the delta/notch/serrate  family of signaling molecules. The paternal expression, chromosomal localization, and biological function of DLK1 also make it a likely candidate  gene for the callipyge phenotype in sheep. Many of the predicted structural and  regulatory features of the DLK1/GTL2 domain are highly analogous to those, Context: including humans, in a high-throughput manner. Here, we report, for the first  time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the  Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved  transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took  advantage of the very recently developed ""unit assembly"" strategy to assemble  two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex  chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently  injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2% of the injected F(0) fertile flies,  we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable  modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications  of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed.","10772900, 22101275, 17980593, 22101275, 11076856, 22624882",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences.

As an antidepressant, which was its original indication when it was developed. 2. As a tobacco use cess","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission.

The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects.

It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. This is mentioned in the context as they have been used to treat both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells. However, there have been safety concerns related to their use","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: of signals and their transmission led to the discovery and the use of Bone  Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). The development of cellular therapy led to the  emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which  include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV).  Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have  successfully been transfected. The ability to control transfected cells and the  capacity to combine and transfect many genes involved in osseous healing will  improve gene therapy., Context: Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid  [G.

Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the, Context: Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in  gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), particularly in immunosuppressed recipient hosts. However,  in the latest packaging cell lines and vectors, the risk of RCR-generation has  been drastically reduced, primarily by minimizing the homologous overlap between, Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR).","21247248, 21798570, 16717285, 7624311, 14683449, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, according to the context, many tumour-specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein-coding genes. These antigens can be identified through methods that amplify gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in the tum","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens.

The present study reveals that gamma radiation  induces single strand breaks in DNA as measured by alkaline comet assay in  bivalves and comet assay serves as a sensitive and rapid method to detect  genotoxicity of gamma radiation. This study further indicates that both M. casta  and P. malabarica exhibit almost identical sensitivity to gamma radiation as  measured by DNA damage., Context: The alkaline version of the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, popularly  known as the Comet assay, is widely used to evaluate the genotoxic potential of  chemicals and environmental contaminants, and for environmental monitoring  purposes. In recent years, this assay has increasingly been recognized as a  potentially valuable tool for regulatory studies. The assay commonly utilises  commercially available software programmes to evaluate the extent of DNA damage at the single-cell level. These programmes provide a large number of measurement  outcomes (i.e., tail length, %Tail DNA, various measures of tail moment, etc.)  to evaluate the extent of DNA migration and DNA damage. At the moment, however, there is no general agreement with respect to the most relevant measurements or  parameters to use. This study was carried out to establish which measurement(s)  in the Comet assay are most significantly correlated with DNA damage, and should, Context: The assay is performed on single cells embedded in agar and placed in an  electrical field at alkaline pH, so that fragments of negatively charged  single-stranded DNA move through the gel toward the positively charged anode.  Undamaged DNA moves relatively slowly, forming the head of the comet, while DNA  fragmented due to the presence of single-strand breaks, moves more quickly  giving the appearance of the tail. The extent of DNA migration is a measure of  the DNA damage present. Since it was first developed, the comet assay has been  adapted for measuring other types of DNA damage. The neutral comet assay has  been employed for DNA double-strand breaks, while techniques using DNA repair enzymes to cleave specific adducts, UvrABC for ultraviolet radiation induced  adducts, for example, have also been described. Here, we describe a modified  version of the comet assay for the measurement of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Interstrand crosslinking agents include the chemotherapeutic agents mitomycin C  and cis-platin, psoralen plus UVA light (PUVA) used to treat hyperproliferative  skin disorders and diepoxybutane, a metabolite of 1,3-butadiene used in, Context: The alkaline version of single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay is widely  used for evaluating DNA damage at the individual cell level. The standard  alkaline method of the comet assay involves deproteinization of cells embedded  in agarose gel using a high salt-detergent lysis buffer, followed by  denaturation of DNA and electrophoresis using a strong alkali at pH>13 [N.P.  Singh, M.T. McCoy, R.R. Tice, E.L. Schneider, A simple technique for  quantitation of low levels of DNA damage in individual cells, Exp. Cell. Res.  175 (1988) 184-191]. However, a recent report showed that a strong alkali  treatment results in simultaneous deproteinization of cells and denaturation of genomic DNA [P. Sestili, C. Martinelli, V. Stocchi, The fast halo assay: an  improved method to quantify genomic DNA strand breakage at the single  cell-level, Mutat. Res. 607 (2006) 205-214].

The observed changes in editing levels are  validated by independent molecular technique. All identified regulatory variants are located in close proximity of modulated editing sites.

We propose that Ski  cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering  with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia.","19534736, 18844071, 12032775, 12032775, 15542823, 15542823","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in  the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to this  epigenetic approach, pitolisant as G-protein coupled histamine H3 receptor (H3R)  antagonist has demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for Prader-Willi  syndrome. To combine these pioneering principles of drug action, we aimed to  identify compounds that combine both activities, guided by the pharmacophore  blueprint for both targets. However, pitolisant as selective H3R inverse agonist  with FDA and EMA-approval did not show the required inhibition at G9a.  Pharmacological characterization of the prominent G9a inhibitor A-366, that is as well an inhibitor of the epigenetic reader protein Spindlin1, revealed its  high affinity at H3R while showing subtype selectivity among subsets of the  histaminergic and dopaminergic receptor families.

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, the context does provide information about the pathway activated by ficolin-3. Ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway, which it helps to activate.","Context: (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were  all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to  SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that  Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore,  Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease  activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption  in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration., Context: as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins.

Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, bats are thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS. This is because MERS-CoV is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus","Context:  Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is, Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed., Context: in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three  nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes  and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other  available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological  data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged  independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory  samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same  geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from  corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these  clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions., Context: A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the  causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012.

We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6., Context: abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells.

These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two  coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: During blood cell development, hematopoietic stem cells generate diverse mature  populations via several rounds of binary fate decisions. At each bifurcation,  precursors adopt one fate and inactivate the alternative fate either  stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells.

The SynapseDB online database  integrates these findings and other functional genomic resources for synaptic  genes. CONCLUSION: Highly conserved elements in nonprotein coding regions of 150  presynaptic genes represent sequences that may be involved in the  transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. Furthermore,  comparative sequence analysis will facilitate selection of genes and noncoding  sequences for future functional studies and analysis of variation studies in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders., Context: Immune responses to invading pathogens are mediated largely through a family of  transmembrane Toll-like receptors and modulated by a number of downstream  effectors. In particular, a family of four interleukin 1 receptor-associated  kinases (IRAK) regulates responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins. Pharmacological  targeting of particular IRAK components may be beneficial for treatment of  bacterial infections. Here, we studied transcriptional regulation of the human IRAK2 gene. Analysis of the IRAK2 promoter region reveals putative binding sites  for several transcriptional factors, including ZIP (EGR1 and SP1), CTCF and  AP-2beta. Deletion of the ZIP or AP-2 sites did not significantly affect IRAK2 promoter activity in naive and endotoxin-treated mononuclear cells, in dormant  and activated Jurkat T-cells, in lung and kidney cells. In contrast, we found  that CTCF plays a major role in IRAK2 transcription. An electrophoretic mobility, Context: are derived from common precursors in the thymus.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, according to the context, stress granules (SGs) localize in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. This is evident as mRNAs and proteins co-localize to form SGs in","Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: of ADAR1 (ADAR1(p150)) is essential for viability. Moreover, a number of studies  have implicated ADAR1(p150) in various stress pathways. We have previously shown  that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells  following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the  Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required  for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of  Zα(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding  protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We  additionally show that the Zα domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules.

We further discovered that  adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1), which can bind  to mRNAs and regulate their translation, was recruited to the SGs in response to high dose of CVB3 by detecting the co-localization of AUF1 with SG markers.  Similar results were also observed in the enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells.

Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With, Context:  A novel antihypertensive drug, LCZ696 (Entresto®), has recently been introduced,  which combines the action of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (RAAS), effectively decreasing the blood pressure, with an inhibition of neprilysin, which is responsible for metabolizing natriuretic peptides exerting  antihypertensive and antifibrotic effects. In this MiniReview, we describe the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy and side effects of the combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696. We summarize  the effect of LCZ696 treatment of patients suffering from hypertension and heart  failure (HF) and further highlight the role of this new drug as a treatment, Context:  ▼ Sacubitril valsartan (Entresto-Novartis) is a new oral drug licensed for the  treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure in adults with reduced ejection  fraction.(1) It is described as an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and contains the neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril and the angiotensin II receptor  antagonist, valsartan.(1-3) Here, we review the evidence for sacubitril  valsartan and consider its place in the management of heart failure., Context: The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is a major target of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A  variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent  seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit  composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and  loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of  antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure  mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR  function, led to the development of ganaxolone.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"Yes, the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) includes point mutations or deletions in the CREBBP gene and EP30","Context:  Familial Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th  and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three  females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces. Proband 5 also had a brain tumor (ganglioglioma) at  the age of 3 years.

The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene.

Both  are potent histone acetyl transferases. A certain level of CREB-binding protein  is essential for normal development, since inactivation of one allele causes  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). There is a direct link between loss of acetyl  transferase activity and RSTS, which indicates that the disorder is caused by aberrant chromatin regulation. We screened the entire CREB-binding protein gene  (CBP) for mutations in patients with RSTS by using methods that find point  mutations and larger rearrangements. In 92 patients, we were able to identify a total of 36 mutations in CBP.

Which viruses are best known to cause myocarditis?,"Yes, Coxsackie B viruses (types 1 to 5) are best known to cause myocarditis. This is stated in the context where it mentions that Coxsackie B viruses are the most","Context:  Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute  myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle., Context: INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation  of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy was  identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to  H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our  knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H1N1 with  myocarditis in pregnancy.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29  and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory  manifestations of H1N1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence.

To study the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular  level, we simulated an infectious situation by infecting cultured human foetal heart cells with Coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus. Successful replication of this virus  could be demonstrated by the presence of virus particles inside cultivated  foetal myocytes together with high titres of progeny virus of 10(8) plaque-forming units (PFU) per millilitre culture medium.

CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if  myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant  association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased  risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. This highlights the need for health care providers to increase awareness amongst caregivers to  target this 'at risk' group aggressively with vaccination and prompt treatment., Context: whether CMR visualizes areas of active myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy was  taken from the region of contrast enhancement and submitted to histopathologic  analysis. Follow-up was performed 3 month later. Contrast enhancement was  present in 28 patients (88%) and was usually seen with one or several foci in  the myocardium. Foci were most frequently located in the lateral free wall. In  the 21 patients in whom biopsy was obtained from the region of contrast  enhancement, histopathologic analysis revealed active myocarditis in 19 patients  (parvovirus B19, n=12; human herpes virus type 6 [HHV 6], n=5). Conversely, in  the remaining 11 patients, in whom biopsy could not be taken from the region of contrast enhancement, active myocarditis was found in one case only (HHV6). At  follow-up, the area of contrast enhancement decreased from 9+/-11% to 3+/-4% of  left ventricular mass as the left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 47+/-19% to 60+/-10%.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"Yes, there is a relationship between thyroid hormones and inflammatory markers in heart failure (HF) patients. The context mentions a study where they investigated plasma circulating levels of cytokines Interleukine-","Context:  Cytokines and thyroid hormones are involved in the biochemical changes  associated to heart failure (HF). AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy, Context: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism., Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies  have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical  hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3), Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3  administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic  rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to, Context: RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports., Context:  Experimental and clinical findings strongly support the concept that thyroid  hormone (TU) has a fundamental role in the cardiovascular homeostasis both in  physiological and pathological conditions. In heart failure (HF) the main alteration of the thyroid function is referred to as low-T3 syndrome  characterized by the reduction in serum total T3 and free T3 with normal levels  of thyroxine and thyrotropin. This syndrome, that affects one third of HF patients, is considered as adaptive factor minimizing catabolic phenomena of  illness. However this interpretative hypothesis is actually questioned.

We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and  macrovascular function were determined.

Development of preeclampsia and maternal complications and both gestational age  at delivery and birthweight were recorded.  RESULTS: Sixty women (34.9%) showed the presence of a thrombophilic defect. They  had a higher risk for the recurrence of preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.1), compared to patients without thrombophilia.  Similar findings were observed considering only heritable thrombophilia.  Thrombophilic patients were at increased risk for the occurrence of very early  preterm delivery (< 32 weeks; OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 3.4-43.2). CONCLUSION: When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia,  screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and  pregnancy management., Context:  Thrombophilias have been implicated in complications related to ischemic  placental disease including recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine fetal demise,  preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm delivery. Maternal screening and treatment may lower the recurrence of these  outcomes. Our objective was to estimate if antenatal screening for  thrombophilias with the intention to offer treatment among women with a prior adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) is preferable to no screening. A  decision-analytical model was constructed for pregnant women with prior APO,  comparing screening for thrombophilia with intention to treat with no screening., Context:  PURPOSE: To determine if thrombophilia is a risk factor for placenta-mediated  pregnancy complications (PMPC) (i.e., preeclampsia, intrauterine growth  restriction (IUGR), placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death and recurrent  pregnancy loss). METHODS: A 5-year retrospective cohort study. Ongoing pregnancies in women with  an antecedent PMPC with thrombophilia were compared with the pregnancies in  similar women without thrombophilia. The main outcome measures were mean birth weight deviations, corrected for gestational age, and recurrence of PMPC.  Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was employed for thromboprophylaxis only.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. The context indicates that hesperidin has been shown to have potential neuroprotective effects in various models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer","Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications.

GPS has been linked to  loss of function mutations in NEABL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), and we describe here a murine GPS model, the Nbeal2(-/-) mouse. As in GPS, Nbeal2(-/-) mice exhibit  splenomegaly, macrothrombocytopenia, and a deficiency of platelet α-granules and  their cargo, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), thrombospondin-1, and platelet factor 4. The platelet α-granule membrane protein P-selectin is  expressed at 48% of wild-type levels and externalized upon platelet activation.  The presence of P-selectin and normal levels of VPS33B and VPS16B in Nbeal2(-/-), Context: platelet α-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be  asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and  significant reduction of the α-granule content. However, they were not  thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2  alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their  platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower  severity of the α-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated  alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet  syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with α-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening  of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe  reduction of the α-granules. Finally, individuals carrying one NBEAL2 mutated allele have mild laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that even  haploinsufficiency has an effect on platelet phenotype., Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized  by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets.

Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context:  The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery.

Experimental data strongly suggests a complex  interaction between the exposome (or environmental influences) and genome  (genetic material) to produce epigenetic changes (epigenome) that can alter the, Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with","26366317, 25186992, 27729837, 29169635, 29169635, 26366317","In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), brain and kidney are the most frequently affected organs.
