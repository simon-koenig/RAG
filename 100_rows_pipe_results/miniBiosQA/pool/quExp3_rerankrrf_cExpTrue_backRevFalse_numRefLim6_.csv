What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation plays a significant role in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblast","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.","23179372, 19270706, 23179372, 19270706, 14688019, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are lncRNAs that are regulated by SAM68. This information is provided","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation., Context: Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases pose severe threats to human  health worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that at least 50% of foam cells  in atheromas are derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); the first  step in this process involves migration to human atherosclerotic lesions. Long  non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play significant roles in diverse  biological processes. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in VSMCs. The expression of lncRNAs or mRNAs was detected using reverse  transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Gene Expression  Omnibus datasets in the NCBI portal were searched using the key words 'Atherosclerosis AND tissue AND Homo sapiens' and the GSE12288 dataset. Gene  expression in circulating leukocytes was measured to identify patients with  coronary artery disease (CAD) or controls, and used to analyze the correlation, Context: various biological processes. Since NONCODE version 3.0 was released 2 years  ago, discovery of novel ncRNAs has been promoted by high-throughput RNA  sequencing (RNA-Seq). In this update of NONCODE, we expand the ncRNA data set by  collection of newly identified ncRNAs from literature published in the last 2  years and integration of the latest version of RefSeq and Ensembl. Particularly,  the number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increased sharply from 73 327 to  210 831. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of  lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs. The 56  018 and 46 475 lncRNA genes were generated from 95 135 and 67 628 lncRNAs for human and mouse, respectively. Additionally, we present expression profile of  lncRNA genes by graphs based on public RNA-seq data for human and mouse, as well  as predict functions of these lncRNA genes. The improvements brought to the database also include an incorporation of an ID conversion tool from RefSeq or  Ensembl ID to NONCODE ID and a service of lncRNA identification. NONCODE is also  accessible through http://www.noncode.org/., Context: Facilitated by the rapid progress of high-throughput sequencing technology, a  large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in mammalian  transcriptomes over the past few years. LncRNAs have been shown to play key  roles in various biological processes such as imprinting control, circuitry  controlling pluripotency and differentiation, immune responses and chromosome  dynamics. Notably, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in disease  etiology. With the increasing number of published lncRNA studies, the  experimental data on lncRNAs (e.g. expression profiles, molecular features and  biological functions) have accumulated rapidly. In order to enable a systematic compilation and integration of this information, we have updated the NONCODE  database (http://www.noncode.org) to version 3.0 to include the first integrated  collection of expression and functional lncRNA data obtained from re-annotated microarray studies in a single database. NONCODE has a user-friendly interface  with a variety of search or browse options, a local Genome Browser for  visualization and a BLAST server for sequence-alignment search. In addition,, Context: Recently, whole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified large numbers of  dynamically expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are involved  in a variety of biological functions. Even so, the functions and molecular  mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain elusive. Therefore, it is necessary to  develop computational methods to predict the function of lncRNAs in order to  accelerate the study of lncRNAs. Here, we review the recent progress in the  identification of lncRNAs, the molecular functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs,  and the computational methods for predicting the function of lncRNAs.","29137239, 29137239, 34608503, 24285305, 22135294, 23319885","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye is subluxated, or displaced from its normal position. This occurs due to the disruption of the zonular fibers that hold the lens","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context:  PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated  ectopia lentis (EL) family. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were collected from the  family including sixteen patients with isolated EL. Blood samples of nine patients, one normal person and two unknown children's were collected. Genomic  DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood. Genotyping was performed  by microsatellite markers and logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE Programs. Mutation screening in the candidate gene,  fibrillin-1 (FBN1), was performed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Linkage to the FBN1 locus is verified. Mutation screening in FBN1, Context:  PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant ectopia lentis  (EL) family having 27 affected members in four generations. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded for 48 family members including 24 persons with isolated ectopia lentis. Candidate gene  regions at 5q and 15q known to be linked with ectopia lentis were analyzed using  fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers. Mutation screening in the candidate gene, fibrillin-1 (FBN1), at 15q was performed by bidirectional sequencing of  the amplified products. RESULTS: A maximum LOD score of 5.74 at theta=0.0 was obtained with marker  D15S1024 in close proximity to FBN1 at 15q21. Mutation screening in FBN1, Context: families underwent ophthalmic and general medical examination. Molecular genetic  studies included homozygosity mapping with SNP markers, DNA sequencing, and  RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Ocular signs in affected persons were increased median corneal  thickness and astigmatism, angle malformation with prominent iris processes,  displacement of the pupil and lens, lens coloboma, spherophakia, loss of zonular  threads, early cataract development, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. No  cardiac or metabolic abnormalities known to be associated with ectopia lentis  were detected. Affected persons shared a 0.67 cM region of homozygosity on  chromosome 1. DNA sequencing revealed a novel mutation in ADAMTSL4, c.767_786del20. This deletion of 20 base pairs (bp) results in a frameshift and  an introduction of a stop codon 113 bp downstream, predicting a C-terminal  truncation of the ADAMTSL4 protein (p.Gln256ProfsX38). Expression of truncated ADAMTSL4 mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Three of 190 local blood donors  were carriers of this mutation.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets.

Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads., Context: BACKGROUND: Telomerase plays an important role in cell proliferation and  carcinogenesis and is believed to be a good target for anti-cancer drugs.  Elimination of template function of telomerase RNA may repress the telomerase  activity.  METHODS: A pseudo-knotted HDV ribozyme (g.RZ57) directed against the RNA  component of human telomerase (hTR) was designed and synthesized. An in vitro  transcription plasmid and a eukaryotic expression plasmid of ribozyme were  constructed. The eukaryotic expression plasmid was induced into heptocellular  carcinoma 7402 cells, colon cancer HCT116 cells and L02 hepatocytes  respectively. Then we determine the cleavage activity of ribozyme against human telomerase RNA component (hTR) both in vitro and in vivo, and detect telomerase  activity continuously. RESULTS: HDV ribozyme showed a specific cleavage activity against the telomerase RNA in vitro. The maximum cleavage ratio reached about 70.4%. Transfection of  HDV ribozyme into 7402 cells and colon cancer cells HCT116 led to growth arrest  and the spontaneous apoptosis of cells, and the telomerase activity dropped to, Context: recent developments in this area of study have been described in greater detail,  in particular the discovery of AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation of RNA  synthesized by RNA polymerase III, which has not been discussed previously.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They protect the genome from invasive transposable elements in the germline by repressing these elements post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. Additionally, they","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform. These results suggest TE sequences are the most direct of PIWI, Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline.

A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown. This strongly correlates with  enrichment of two histone H3 modifications (dimethylation of lysine 79 and","23124062, 18809914, 26279487, 25336588, 23124062, 21764773",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Yes, oligopaint FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) probes can be used to visually represent genomic regions in a spatial context within a cell nucleus. These probes are single-stranded","Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context: multiple genomes. In contrast, the View Synteny page gives access to perfect and  imperfect synteny blocks precomputed for a large number of genomes, without the  need for users to retrieve and format input data. Additionally, genes are  cross-linked with public databases for effective browsing. For both Run  OrthoCluster and View Synteny, identified synteny blocks can be browsed at the  whole genome, chromosome, and individual gene level. OrthoClusterDB is freely  accessible.  CONCLUSION: We have developed an online system for the identification and  visualization of synteny blocks among multiple genomes. The system is freely  available at (http://genome.sfu.ca/orthoclusterdb/)., Context: Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

Whereas higher-order effects, such as  chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA  shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA  binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser  for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at  http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller  twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the  entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the  GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative  values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide  resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly  and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start  sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species., Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed, but no particular set of genes or genomes is identified as the ""minimal genome."" Additionally, the","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced., Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell., Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this  goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for  functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can  then be used as a template for future systems.

Certain of the component parts are well known, but  the overall picture is blurred and often confusing. Small genome species have chromosomes in their interphase nuclei disposed in diffuse chromosome  territories, without any Rabl arrangement, while in large genomes the  chromosomes run string-like through the nucleus with a Rabl orientation following through the cell cycle.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 deposits H4 Lys 20 methylation. This is stated in the second sentence of the second paragraph where it mentions that ""Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found","Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: It is almost ten years since senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs)  were first described in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Since then, a number  of factors have been identified that affect SAHF formation, including HMGA  proteins, structural components of SAHFs. However, the involvement of epigenetic  marks in SAHF formation remains unclear. Our recent study, combining microscopy  and ChIP-seq approaches, revealed that SAHFs are formed through spatial  repositioning of the genome. This occurs according to certain chromatin features  that are correlated with, but do not require, the repressive marks histone H3  trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3. These repressive marks are segregated from each other within SAHFs, forming layered high-order chromatin  structures (HOCS). During the dynamic change in HOCS as SAHFs form, the linear  epigenomic profiles of these repressive marks are highly static. This is in marked contrast to the spreading of repressive marks occurring during embryonic  cell differentiation. Thus the layered HOCS of SAHFs is likely achieved mainly  through the spatial rearrangement of pre-existing heterochromatin, rather than, Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context: leads to overubiquitination of histone H2B. A key component of the  ubiquitin-protease module of the SAGA complex, Sus1, is encoded by a gene that  contains two introns and is misspliced when the CBC is deleted, leading to  destabilization of the ubiquitin protease complex and defective modulation of  cellular H2B levels. These data demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing plays a  critical role in histone H2B ubiquitination and that the CBC in particular helps  to establish the proper state of chromatin and proper expression of genes that  are regulated at the level of histone H2B ubiquitination., Context: An organism's genome sequence serves as a blueprint for the proteins and  regulatory RNAs essential for cellular function. The genome also harbors  cis-acting non-coding sequences that control gene expression and are essential  to coordinate regulatory programs during embryonic development. However, the  genome sequence is largely identical between cell types within a multi-cellular  organism indicating that factors such as DNA accessibility and chromatin  structure play a crucial role in governing cell-specific gene expression. Recent  studies have identified particular chromatin modifications that define  functionally distinct cis regulatory elements. Among these are forms of histone 3 that are mono- or tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3,  respectively), which bind preferentially to promoter and enhancer elements in  the mammalian genome. In this work, we investigated whether these modified histones could similarly identify cis regulatory elements within the zebrafish  genome.

RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese.

Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar  observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting  phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis.  These specific genotype-phenotype correlations in the FGFR disorders seem to be  unprecedented in the study of human disease. The explanation for this high, Context: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth  factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA from seven sporadic cases of achondroplasia was studied by  using PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes. RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a  frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene  mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid  and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of  achondroplasia., Context:  OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To investigate the mutation at the transmembrane domain  of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) nucleotide 1138 site for  identifying the major pathologic mechanism of achondroplasia (ACH) and to evaluate the efficacy of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) method  for screening the point mutations. METHODS: The genomic DNA from 17 clinically diagnosed ACH patients where  analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) with Sfc I and Msp I restriction endonucleases and by  PCR-DGGE technique for screening. RESULTS: G to A transition mutation at nucleotide 1138 was detected in 14/17 of, Context: increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals,  suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals  are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal  dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In  contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and  affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia  parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome  4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains  a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent  missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3  protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant  genotype segregates with the disease in these families.

The blood concentration  of HbF, or the number of cells with detectable HbF (F-cells), does not measure the amount of HbF/F-cell. Even patients with high HbF can have severe disease  because HbF is unevenly distributed among F-cells, and some cells might have  insufficient concentrations to inhibit HbS polymerization. With mean HbF levels of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the distribution of HbF/F-cell can greatly vary, even  if the mean is constant.

Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development.

Ubiquitylation of CMG in  yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only  detectable site of ubiquitylation both in vitro and in vivo (though in vivo  other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates  in vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model  whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome  replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction., Context: Tpr is a 267-kDa protein forming coiled coil-dominated homodimers that locate at  the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The proteins that  tether Tpr to this location are unknown. Moreover, the question whether Tpr  itself might act as a scaffold onto which other NPC components need to be  assembled has not been answered to date. To assess Tpr's role as an  architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of  Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference  (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to  precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase.

Analysis of  restriction-enzyme-induced mutations suggests that double-strand break ends are  modified to facilitate rejoining and that the type of modification is  characteristic for different end structures. Double-strand breaks with cohesive  ends appear to have fewer modifications introduced at the break points before rejoining than breaks with blunt ends.

After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma. Yet the challenge for clinicians is to  determine the optimal choice of agents as first-line or second-line therapy and  which offers the best chance for overall survival for the individual patient in this rapidly changing field., Context:  This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN  Guidelines) for Bladder Cancer focuses on systemic therapy for muscle-invasive  urothelial bladder cancer, as substantial revisions were made in the 2017 updates, such as new recommendations for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab,  durvalumab, and avelumab.

Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and  its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown  promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and  PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could  potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical  efficacy., Context: (40 [16%]).

INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients  with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety  profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients. These data provide the  rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis.

For simplification and to avoid methodological limitations  of synthesis and coupling chemistry, we herewith present a novel and optimized  approach by using adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as effective and high-density  mimotope-display system, which can be directly used for vaccination. METHODS: An AAV capsid display library was constructed by genetically  incorporating random peptides in a plasmid encoding the wild-type AAV2 capsid  protein. AAV clones, expressing peptides specifically reactive to trastuzumab,  were employed to immunize BALB/c mice. Antibody titers against human HER-2 were  determined, and the isotype composition and functional properties of these were tested. Finally, prophylactically immunized mice were challenged with human  HER-2 transfected mouse D2F2/E2 cells. RESULTS: HER-2 mimotope AAV-vaccines induced antibodies specific to human HER-2.

HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity.

Specifically, GRIK3 encodes a principal subunit of this receptor.","Context: have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of  these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and  assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of  all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous  analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We  find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1,  class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently  identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group ""class 4"" to distinguish  it from the unrelated ""class 3"" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms  contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of  HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC  proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria.

We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we  identified a novel single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT  (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of the STXBP1 gene. This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with neonatal-onset focal seizures broadens the spectrum  of clinically relevant human disorders caused by STXBP1 mutations., Context: BACKGROUND: Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is  approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors  overexpress Her2 (erbB2/neu). Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential  component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells,  including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its  amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We determined expression of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in  BT/Her(R) cells selected for resistance to Herceptin.

The  mechanistic explanation for this colinearity has been elusive, and it may well  be that a single and universal cause does not exist. The Hox-gene complex  (HOM-C) has been rearranged differently in several Drosophila species, producing  a striking diversity of Hox gene organizations. We investigated the genomic and functional consequences of the two HOM-C splits present in Drosophila buzzatii.  Firstly, we sequenced two regions of the D. buzzatii genome, one containing the  genes labial and abdominal A, and another one including proboscipedia, and compared their organization with that of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura in  order to map precisely the two splits.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. In the context, it is mentioned that DICO induces Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release, which in turn activates caspase-9 and","Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context: Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an apoptosis-inducing protein that  participates in cell death during normal development and in various diseases.  Bax resides in an inactive state in the cytosol of many cells. In response to  death stimuli, Bax protein undergoes conformational changes that expose  membrane-targeting domains, resulting in its translocation to mitochondrial  membranes, where Bax inserts and causes release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin  (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes. HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Conversely,  reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and  increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association","23567243, 23536162, 21069436, 23536162, 23475110, 12732850","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in various types of cancer including lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and others. This is based on the context information provided where it","Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis. The identification of MALAT-1 emphasizes  the potential role of noncoding RNAs in human cancer., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1., Context: INTRODUCTION: The functions of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have remained  elusive in many cases.

However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the, Context:  INTRODUCTION: The functions of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have remained  elusive in many cases.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, according to the context provided, the 3D structure of the genome is not stable during cell differentiation. Instead, it undergoes substantial remodeling as a part of the development and differentiation process. This is exemplified","Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity., Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. During epidermal, Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside, Context: and convenient access to these data. We introduce simultaneously a database  system to store and query 3D genomic data (3DBG), and a 3D genome browser to  visualize and explore 3D genome structures (3DGB). We benchmark 3DBG against  state-of-the-art systems and demonstrate that it is faster than previous  solutions, and importantly gracefully scales with the size of data.

'3DIV' is available at  http://kobic.kr/3div., Context: Despite the cloning of four disease-associated genes for Fanconi anemia (FA),  the molecular pathogenesis of FA remains largely unknown. To study FA  complementation group A using the mouse as a model system, we cloned and  characterized the mouse homolog of the human FANCA cDNA. The mouse cDNA (Fanca)  encodes a 161-kDa protein that shares 65% amino acid sequence identity with  human FANCA. Fanca is located at the distal region of mouse chromosome 8 and has  a ubiquitous pattern of expression in embryonic and adult tissues. Expression of  the mouse cDNA in human FA-A cells restores the cellular drug sensitivity to  normal levels. Thus, the expression pattern, protein structure, chromosomal location, and function of FANCA are conserved in the mouse. We also isolated a  novel zinc finger protein, Zfp276, which has five C(2)H(2) domains.  Interestingly, Zfp276 is situated in the Fanca locus, and the 3'UTR of its cDNA overlaps with the last four exons of Fanca in a tail-to-tail manner. Zfp276 is  expressed in the same tissues as Fanca, but does not complement the mitomycin C  (MMC)-sensitive phenotype of FA-A cells.

The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context there is no evidence that thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations are implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The context only mentions mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone acts via receptor subtypes (TRα1, TRβ1, TRβ2) with  differing tissue distributions, encoded by distinct genes (THRA, THRB). THRB  mutations cause a disorder with central (hypothalamic-pituitary) resistance to thyroid hormone action with markedly elevated thyroid hormone and normal TSH  levels. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review describes the clinical features, genetic and  molecular pathogenesis of a homologous human disorder mediated by defective THRA. Clinical features include growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia and  constipation associated with low-normal T4 and high-normal T3 levels and a low  T4/T3 ratio, together with subnormal reverse T3 levels. Heterozygous TRa1, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a genetic disease caused by the mutations  of the thyroid hormone beta receptor (TRbeta) gene, producing receptors with a  dominant negative action. The present study addressed the question as to whether tissue-specific factors modulate the dominant negative function in different  tissues. We prepared stably transfected pituitary GH3 (GH3-PV) and liver  SK-Hep-1 (SK-Hep-1-PV) cell lines with a potent dominant negative mutant, PV. The growth hormone (GH) and the malic enzyme genes (ME) in GH3 and SK-Hep-1,  respectively, are directly regulated by the thyroid hormone,  3,3,'5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3).

Unlike the TR beta gene, a mutation in the TR alpha1 gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).  Previously we found a mutant TR beta with an 11-carboxyl (C)-terminal amino acid  truncation (betaF451X) in a girl with severe RTH. BetaF451X is a natural mutant with disruption of the transactivation domain, tau4, and it had very strong  dominant negative activities.

Three products are actually in the market, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®)  apixaban (Eliquis®) and edoxaban (Lixiana®). Efficacy and safety have been  tested for rivaroxaban and apixaban in large study programmes with more than  60'000 patients each. For edoxaban large phase III studies are under way. Based on these data rivaroxaban was registered in the EU and CH for primary  prophylaxis against thrombosis after major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip- and  knee-joint protheses, for treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and for prophylaxis against thromboembolic stroke in patients  with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is presently registered in the EU and CH for  prophylaxis against thrombosis after major orthopaedic surgery, Edoxaban is, Context:  The new direct oral anticoagulants directly targeting thrombin (factor IIa) or  factor-Xa, are currently used for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and  pulmonary embolism (rivaroxaban, Xarelto) or for the prevention of systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (rivaroxaban; dabigatran, Pradaxa;  Apixaban, Eliquis). Given their ease of use, it is expected that these drugs  would be widely used in such long-term indications. Beyond their effectiveness, these treatments remain anticoagulant drugs, potentially responsible for  bleeding complications, and specific measures should be defined in case of  occurrence of such complications., Context:  Apixaban (Eliquis™), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being developed by  Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer as a therapy for the prevention and/or treatment  of thrombotic disorders. Apixaban has been approved in the EU for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hip or knee replacement. A rolling  submission for approval of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients  with atrial fibrillation has also been initiated in the US. Worldwide phase III development of apixaban is underway for the prevention and treatment of VTE, and  prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Development for acute  coronary syndromes has been stopped following the discontinuation of the phase, Context:  Apixaban (Eliquis®) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for  use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Like other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban has generally predictable pharmacological properties and does not require routine  anticoagulation monitoring. In large phase III trials, oral apixaban was  noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapped with and followed by oral warfarin (enoxaparin/warfarin) in the treatment of adults with acute VTE  over 6 months with regard to the incidence of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death  (AMPLIFY), and was significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention, Context: critical. While many inhibitors without a basic group have progressed into the  clinic for ones with alanine 190, the task for those with serine 190 remains  extremely challenging, if not impossible. In addition to warfarin, heparin, and  low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), treatment options have expanded with the  development and approval of the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The NOACs are  superior to vitamin K antagonists in terms of rapid onset, pharmacokinetics,  drug/food interactions, and regular coagulation monitoring; but one serious  drawback is the lack of an effective antidote at this time. Apixaban (Eliquis),  rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical  practice.

At week 12, serious adverse events had  occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the  placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab significantly improved response rates among patients with psoriatic arthritis. Larger studies of longer duration are necessary to  assess adverse events. (Funded by Amgen; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01516957  .)., Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab  neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical  trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The  biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials  was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible  differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A  ligand., Context: virus infection, respectively. Over the last few years, considerable efforts  have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases  to treat lymphocyte malignancies, autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity. The  rationale is that even if complete lack of BTK or ITK during development causes  severe immunodeficiency, inactivation after birth may result in a less severe  phenotype. Moreover, therapy can be transient or only partially block the  activity of BTK or ITK. Furthermore, a drug-induced B cell deficiency is  treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy. The newly developed BTK  inhibitor PCI-32765, recently renamed Ibrutinib, has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for  multiple myeloma. Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising  treatment effects also in autoimmunity. ITK inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase, but it can be expected that such drugs will also become  very useful. In this study, we present BTK and ITK with their signalling  pathways and review the development of the corresponding inhibitors., Context: The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial  pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated  with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and  bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab  was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have  previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,  preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the  binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques,  we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP  domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189, Context: are considered to be attractive therapeutic targets. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class  BTK inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of several types of B-cell  malignancies worldwide.

No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted  during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no  increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who  were cooled.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprises data from medical  records of newborn children born with HIE during a period of 32 months. Relevant  data for cooling were recorded. Structured neurological examinations were  carried out on survivors when they were ten and or 18 months old. RESULTS: A total of 32 infants fulfilled the criteria for cooling, the incidence being 0.4/1000 births. Twenty infants were cooled for 72 hours. Eleven infants  had cooling discontinued before 72 hours because of their grave prognosis. One  infant had cooling discontinued because of pulmonary hypertension. Most infants were cooled before six hours of age (median four hours). The mortality rate was  41%. A total of 45% were cooled without being placed in a ventilator. The side  effects were of no major concern. Eight children had a neurological follow-up., Context: OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with multiple organ dysfunction  syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality. There is extensive  experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in  infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety  of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a  randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants  who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at  least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress. Three groups (n = 5 per group) were  cooled to core temperatures of 35.5 degrees C (+/-0.5 degrees C), 34.5 degrees  C, and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, for 48 hours before rewarming to 37 degrees","22320395, 22320395, 22320395, 20100756, 20470651, 20100756",Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in term or late preterm infants.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, telomerase is the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat. The context mentions that Imetelstat is a potent and specific inhibitor of telomerase, which is an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic","Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context:  Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity  for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths., Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy., Context: the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program  illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced  definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in  the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target  disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for  druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene,  protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism  of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging  integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,  drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is  publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github (  http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal (, Context: inactivation of the resulting proteins by BG or 5-nitroso-BP. Chimeric  alkyltransferase proteins were made in which the residues on the amino side of  the cysteine acceptor site came from Ada-C and the residues on the carboxyl side  came from AGT and vice versa but these did not show sensitivity to BG suggesting  that resistance is produced by residues in both segments of the protein.  Analysis of the Ada-C mutant proteins revealed two sites for mutations that  confer sensitivity to these inhibitors. One of these was tryptophan-336 and the  other was residues lysine-314 and alanine-316. Thus, when the combined mutations  of A316P/W336A were made in the Ada-C sequence, the protein was sensitive to inactivation by BG. This A316P/W336A mutant protein was even more sensitive to  5-nitroso-BP and the mutant proteins W336A, K314P/A316P and A316P could also be  inhibited by this drug (in decreasing order of sensitivity) although the control Ada-C and a mutant R335S were not inhibited. These results provide strong  support for the hypothesis that the resistance of the Ada-C alkyl-transferase is  due to a steric effect limiting access to the active site.

Here, both computational  and synthetic approaches were used to design and synthesize newer HIV-1  integrase inhibitors.

What is the color of the protein Ranasmurfin?,The color of the protein Ranasmurfin is blue. This is explicitly stated in the context as it mentions that the crystals of the purified and crystallized ranasmurfin protein are an intense blue color.,"Context: Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp lycopersici (Fol) is one of the  main diseases affecting tomatoes. The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress. These results demonstrate the  presence of important mechanisms for defense against Fol in the tomato genotype  BHRS 2,3., Context:  Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing  structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological  sources.

Protein labeling with CyDyes is hampered by protein  precipitation and gel smearing when used above minimal labeling. The solubility  of labeled protein may be improved by introducing water solubilizing groups on  the dye such as cysteic acids. However, addition of a negatively charged functionality will have the undesired effect of shifting the pI in relation to  the unlabeled protein. These limitations have been addressed through the  synthesis of highly water-soluble and pI balancing zwitterionic CyDye fluorophores (Z-CyDyes). The new dyes feature a cysteic acid motif, a titratable  amine functionality and a NHS activated ester group. In side by side 2D-DIGE  comparisons of Z-CyDyes and CyDyes, the new dyes significantly enhanced protein, Context: neighbors within a few hours. The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues. On the  basis of these staining patterns, we found that many olfactory sensory neurons  in the developing mouse olfactory epithelium showed sustained caspase activity","28549197, 20615601, 17077494, 17077494, 23941326, 18483489",Ranasmurfin is a blue protein.,"20615601, 17077494"
List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two main symptoms associated with Aagenaes syndrome. These are idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities.","Context: OBJECTIVES: As the disease can display different clinical presentations, which  are mainly unspecific, and considering the importance of an early diagnosis and  the proper and early management of it, this study was carried out to present a  general overview of VHL. Moreover, the present article reviews screening methods  and emphasizes the need for increasing the awareness of different health care  professionals to diagnose and refer the patients in the early stages.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of internet medical databases, such as  PubMed, was carried out on known or suggested; clinical presentations,  pathogenesis, screening, causes and criteria for diagnosis of patients and their  referrals. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that VHL is caused by a mutation in the von  Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. It also showed that different screening methods can be  utilized for the early diagnosis and referral of patients. Different clinical presentations of the disease are also elaborated in some detail and their  treatment options are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the need for a multidisciplinary approach to VHL,, Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome., Context: tumors. We report, a 14-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of  aplastic anemia (AA). Subsequent bone marrow examination and multiparametric  flowcytometric immunophenotyping revealed an evolving hypoplastic acute myeloid  leukemia. Chromosomal breakage studies using clastogenic agent mitomycin C  showed 88% stress induced chromosomal/chromatid breaks, gaps and rearrangements  revealing an underlying FA. The case emphasizes upon the role of a systematic  clinico-investigative approach in diagnosing such patients who by clinical  criteria appear to have idiopathic AA and appear phenotypically normal. A timely  and accurate diagnosis becomes vital in these cases to implement appropriate  therapy., Context: Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of  inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for  a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative  disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders  (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4)  Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant  Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO).

A literature search for all conditions associated  with RLS was performed. These included secondary RLS disorders and factors that  may exacerbate RLS. All of these conditions were reviewed with respect to  potential pathogenesis including reports of iron deficiency, neuropathy, SIBO,  inflammation and immune changes. A condition was defined as highly-associated if  there was a prevalence study that utilized an appropriate control group. Small  case reports were recorded but not included as definite RLS-associated  conditions. Fifty four diseases, syndromes and conditions have been reported to cause and/or exacerbate RLS. Of these, 38 have been reported to have a higher  prevalence than age-matched controls, 9 have adequate sized reports and have  general acceptance as RLS-associated conditions and 7 have been reported in case report form.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 has an effect on chromatin. In the context, EZH2 is described as a histone methyltransferase that plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. It","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context:  PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival., Context: In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia  (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (Ezh2). Tumor cells show little residual H3K27 trimethylation marks compared  with controls. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 Polycomb group protein complex,  which is associated with DNA methyltransferases. Using next-generation  sequencing, we identify alteration in gene expression levels of EZH2 and acquired mutations in PRC2-associated genes (DNMT3A and JARID2) in human adult  T-ALL. Together, these studies document that deregulation of EZH2 and associated  genes leads to the development of mouse, and likely human, T-ALL., Context: Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a potentially fatal bone marrow (BM) failure  syndrome. IFN-γ-producing Th1 CD4(+) T cells mediate the immune destruction of  hematopoietic cells, and they are central to the pathogenesis. However, the  molecular events that control the development of BM-destructive Th1 cells remain  largely unknown. Ezh2 is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple  cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression. We recently reported that Ezh2 is crucial for inflammatory T cell responses after allogeneic BM  transplantation. To elucidate whether Ezh2 mediates pathogenic Th1 responses in  AA and the mechanism of Ezh2 action in regulating Th1 cells, we studied the effects of Ezh2 inhibition in CD4(+) T cells using a mouse model of human AA.  Conditionally deleting Ezh2 in mature T cells dramatically reduced the  production of BM-destructive Th1 cells in vivo, decreased BM-infiltrating Th1, Context: The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer  of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Several lines of  evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and  perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed,  the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and  with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene. The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a  candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype. We  report here the genomic structure and fine mapping of the EZH2 gene. We demonstrate that the functional gene actually maps to chromosome 7q35 and that  the sequence previously isolated from a chromosome 21 cosmid corresponds to a  pseudogene. Finally, the nature of the EZH2 protein and its mapping to the, Context:  Ezh2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2) protein is the enzymatic component of the  Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which represses gene expression by  methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Recently, hot-spot mutations of  Ezh2 were identified in diffused large B-cell lymphomas and follicular  lymphomas. To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1,  which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the  enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine.","24469045, 18980972, 22431509, 24760151, 10780782, 23236167",Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms,"24077602, 21892963, 22821416, 18980972, 9214638, 25680271, 20631058, 15520282, 19954516, 22966008, 24040281, 23688634, 25617436, 19026781"
What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Yes, the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is autosomal dominant. This is explicitly stated in the context information provided.","Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context: detected by molecular genetic method.

In 2 patients (sister and brother) the  sarcoglycanopathy 2C type C283Q mutation was proven in one Roma family suffering  from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). Two out of the three  facioscapular-humeral dystrophy (FSHD) Roma families carried 21.8 kb and 18.5 kb  alleles in FSHD A1 gene (D4S139). In one family together with prenatal diagnosis  founder mutation in FSHD A1 gene was detected, according to the autosomal  dominant (AD) inheritance. In (F2) prenatal diagnosis was carried out, 18.5 kb/18.5 kb homozygosity was proven in the fetus, so the pregnancy was  interrupted. In the CMS, LGMD and FSHD Roma patients ancient typical Roma  founder mutations were found., Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement.

The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context: region, resulting in relaxation of the chromatin structure and release of DUX4  repression. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally  epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. Stable expression of DUX4, however,  can only occur in the presence of a permissive genetic background, which  contains a polyadenylation signal sequence that stabilizes DUX4 mRNA. Expression  of DUX4 mRNA and protein occurs at low frequency but in high abundance in FSHD  myotube nuclei. DUX4 expression in transfection studies induces apoptosis and  interferes with myogenesis. SUMMARY: FSHD results from a unique combination of genetic and epigenetic changes on 4q35 leading to release of repression of DUX4, causing disease in a  toxic gain-of-function manner. Questions remain regarding the normal function of  DUX4 and how expression of DUX4 in somatic cells leads to FSHD., Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy).

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study with rats, there is evidence that tomato juice can lower cholesterol levels. The intervention group of rats that consumed tomato juice had significantly lower total, LDL and HDL cholesterol","Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

This is evident as the context discusses the use of isradipine for controlling blood pressure in children and","Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen.

In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: BACKGROUND: Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine  class. It has limited effects on myocardial contractility; is available in a  powder-filled capsule and has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours.  METHODS: Pharmacy records were reviewed to identify pediatric patients who had  received isradipine. The following demographic data were obtained: age, weight,  sex, underlying medical problems, and initial blood pressure values. Information  concerning isradipine included the initial dose and its interval, subsequent  dose escalations, blood pressure response to the medication, and duration of  therapy. RESULTS: The study population comprised 12 patients, ranging in age from 10 days to 11 years. The etiology of the hypertension was renal in 9 cases and nonrenal  in 3. Initial dosing with isradipine was 0.1 mg/kg/dose. Six patients had  emergent hypertension, and their blood pressure had been controlled with intravenous nicardipine before oral isradipine. Six patients received initial  therapy with oral isradipine. Isradipine was monotherapy in 7 patients and in  combination with other agents in 5 patients. The dose of isradipine required for, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner., Context: depression increased significantly after isradipine at 3 hours post 0800 hour  dose compared to placebo (87 vs. 7 seconds, p < 0.01) but not at the 0, 8, or  12-hour postdose time points, regardless of which baseline was used. Isradipine  therapy did not affect the rate-pressure double product. A significant  correlation between the mean increase in total exercise time and mean plasma  isradipine concentration was also present (p = 0.0295). During double-blind  treatment, drug-related adverse events were experienced by four patients in the  isradipine group and two patients in the placebo group. None of the patients  experienced ischemic complications during the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS), Context: concerning isradipine included the initial dose and its interval, subsequent  dose escalations, blood pressure response to the medication, and duration of  therapy.

Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context: genetic mechanisms play a role in the activation of PDGFR-RAS/MAPK signalling in  medulloblastoma, we performed a direct sequence analysis of the established  mutational ""hotspots"" of known targets of activating mutations within the  pathway (PDGFRA, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS and BRAF) and PDFRFB, in a cohort of 28  primary tumours. A synonymous sequence variation in PDGFRA (CCG to CCA; PRO 567  PRO) was detected in two cases (approximately 7%), but not in 150 normal  chromosomes assessed, suggesting that the PDGFRA locus may be associated with  medulloblastoma development in certain cases. No evidence for oncogenic  mutations affecting NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or PDFRFB was found in any case. These data demonstrate that activating mutations in established mutational  hotspots within the PDGFR-RAS/MAPK pathway are rare events in medulloblastoma  development, and suggest that alternative mechanisms are responsible for RAS/MAPK pathway activation in this disease., Context:  To better understand the genetic basis of medulloblastoma development, we sought  genomic amplifications and deletions in these tumors using digital karyotyping  in combination with expression analysis. Five medulloblastoma genomes were karyotyped by sequencing an average of 195,745 genomic DNA tags for each  analysis.

Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

What is ceritinib?,"Yes, ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. It is used to treat","Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase, Context: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is detected in 3-7% of patients  with non-small-cell lung cancer. Crizotinib is an ALK inhibitor, which was  approved in 2011 for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Despite the  initial enthusiasm, most of the patients develop resistance within the first  year of treatment. The main mechanisms are secondary mutations and bypass track  activation. Moreover, crizotinib has low penetration into the central nervous  system. The need to overcome these limitations has led to the development of  second-generation inhibitors that have better effectiveness against  crizotinib-resistant mutations and brain metastases. Ceritinib and alectinib are the only approved drugs of this group. Many ongoing trials try to define the  most appropriate agent for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer depending  on the responsible mechanism. This review focuses on the current data regarding the potential mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors and the strategies to  overcome it., Context: highly active therapeutic interventions. After discovery of ALK rearrangements  in NSCLC, it was recognized that these confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition.  Areas covered: Crizotinib, the first-in-class ALK/ROS1/MET inhibitor, was  initially approved as second-line treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC but  after this, it was firmly established as the standard first-line therapy for  advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. After initial response to crizotinib, tumors  inevitably relapse. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, more potent and  brain-penetrable than crizotinib, may be effective in re-inducing remissions  when cancers are still addicted to ALK. Ceritinib and alectinib are approved for metastatic ALK positive NSCLC patients, while brigatinib received granted  accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration.  Regarding ROS1 rearrangement, to date crizotinib is the only ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor receiving indication as treatment of ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC.

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper.

Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02).

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models called SSCprofiler is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions. This method integrates sequence, structure, and conservation","Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: (IALT), the largest randomized study conducted to date of adjuvant chemotherapy  in patients with radically resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).  Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined  by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor  specimens from 639 IALT patients. The prognostic and predictive values of  microRNA expression for survival were studied using a Cox model, which included  every factor used in the stratified randomization, clinicopathologic prognostic  factors, and other factors statistically related to microRNA expression.  Investigation of the expression pattern of microRNAs in situ was performed. We also analyzed the association of TP53 mutation status and miR-34a/b/c  expression, epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation status, and  miR-21 and Let-7a expression. Finally, the association of p16 and miR-29b expression was assessed. Overall, no significant association was found between  any of the tested microRNAs and survival, with the exception of miR-21 for which  a deleterious prognostic effect of lowered expression was suggested. Otherwise,, Context: evident, especially with the discovery that about 97% of the transcriptional  output in higher organisms are represented as noncoding RNAs: rRNA, snoRNAs,  tRNA, transposable elements, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, intergenic  regions and microRNAs. MicroRNAs function by negatively regulating gene  expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs and  thus participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular  processes including: development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and  apoptosis pathways. MicroRNA expression profiles in many types of cancers have  been identified. Recent reports have revealed that the expression profiles of microRNAs change in various human cancers and appear to function as oncogenes or  tumor suppressors. Abnormal microRNA expression has increasingly become a common  feature of human cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the involvement of microRNAs in different types of cancer and their potential  use as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers in the future., Context: of this study is to identify the colorectal cancer (CRC) specific miRNAs and  their target mRNAs using a multi-step approach. RESULTS: A multi-step approach combining microarray miRNA and mRNA expression  profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the CRC specific  miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. First, 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and  2916 mRNAs from CRC samples and their corresponding normal epithelial tissues  were identified by miRNA and mRNA microarray, respectively. Secondly, 22  dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target mRNAs (72 miRNA-mRNA pairs) were  identified by a combination of Pearson's correlation analysis and prediction by databases TargetScan and miRanda.

CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients., Context:  Ewing's sarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour occurring in children  and adolescents and exists in two different clinicopathological entities:  osseous Ewing's sarcoma (OES) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES). Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific  symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22  years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical  exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant  radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine,, Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context:  To apply safely an aggressive chemotherapy regimen like CESS 81 requires  intensive supportive care. Bleomycin is evaluated as part of the protocol for  treatment of primary Ewing's sarcoma. Bleomycin might cause pulmonary fibrosis at higher cumulative doses as toxic effect directly to the lungs or most likely  in addition by the formation of vascular microthrombi.

What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?,"Yes, TRH does have an effect on myocardial contractility. In isolated rat hearts, TRH in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on","Context: cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7  and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l, which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that,, Context: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits  following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites. These experiments indicate that inactivation of the major early polyadenylation signal is not sufficient to induce expression  of the BPV late genes in transformed mouse cells., Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation., Context: gene confirmed the presence of 3 IVS.

What is CPX-351,CPX-3,"Context: AML is highest. Therapeutic options mainly consist of hypomethylating agents,  ongoing clinical trials and, less commonly, intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.  CPX-351, a novel liposomal formulation which encapsulates cytarabine and  daunorubicin in 5:1 molar ratio, has shown promising efficacy, leading to recent  US FDA approval for front-line therapy for patients with therapy-related AML and  AML with myelodysplasia-related changes based on a large multicenter Phase III  clinical trial. This review summarizes the clinical development of CPX-351 as  induction therapy., Context: BACKGROUND: CPX-351 (United States: Vyxeos®; Europe: Vyxeos® Liposomal), a  dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a  synergistic 1:5 molar ratio, is approved by the US FDA and the EMA for the  treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. In a pivotal  phase 3 study that evaluated 309 patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly  diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia, CPX-351 significantly  improved median overall survival versus conventional 7 + 3 chemotherapy  (cytarabine continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin for 3 days), with a comparable safety profile. A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease  or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare  survival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11,  2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient, Context: PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation.  METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a  population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome., Context: AIMS: To investigate the effects of methotrexate (MTX) on the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of CP-690,550, a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development as a  therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to determine the effects of multiple  doses of CP-690,550 on the PK of MTX, and to evaluate the short-term safety and  tolerability of co-administration of CP-690,550 and MTX. METHODS: This was a fixed-dose drug-drug interaction study. Twelve patients diagnosed with RA for at least 6 months were enrolled in a Phase I, open-label  study of the PK of multiple doses of CP-690,550 (30 mg b.i.d.) and single doses  of MTX (15-25 mg per week). RESULTS: All patients completed the study and were evaluated for PK and safety.  CP-690,550 exposure was not affected by co-administration with MTX; AUC(12)  ratio (CP-690,550 + MTX/CP-690,550) was 103.06% [90% confidence interval (CI), Context: disease. Responses usually occurred within the first 4 months of treatment, and  the median duration of response exceeded 8 months. The most common adverse  events included fatigue, change in hair color, nausea, dysgeusia, and  periorbital edema; adverse events rarely led to discontinuation of treatment.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker because it binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells. This property can be used to detect and quantify apoptosis in","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the  immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology.

METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin.

Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine.

The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection  of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of Renilla luciferase can be detected by luminometric measurements.

These elements have been found to have diverse  functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The  evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined. RESULTS: Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human.

Current therapies  include drug treatments, lifestyle modification, device therapy and heart  transplantation. However, the ""holy grail"" of heart failure treatment would be  to achieve widespread regeneration of diseased cardiac tissue. Examples of  regeneration of living tissue are present in nature and involve stem cells. The  two key defining properties of stem cells are their ability to renew themselves through cell division and to differentiate into various cell types. Generally,  stem cells can be classified into embryonic or adult forms. Human adult stem  cells are ethically appealing and have already been used in clinical trials in a variety of disease states. Bone marrow derived stem cells, skeletal myoblasts  and resident adult cardiac stem cells are being explored as potential cell types  for heart failure treatment. These cells can be delivered to the heart via a, Context:  Epigenetics, through control of gene expression circuitries, plays important  roles in various physiological processes such as stem cell differentiation and  self renewal. This occurs during embryonic development, in different tissues, and in response to environmental stimuli. The language of epigenetic program is  based on specific covalent modifications of DNA and chromatin. Thus, in addition  to the individual identity, encoded by sequence of the four bases of the DNA, there is a cell type identity characterized by its positioning in the epigenetic  ""landscape"".

Whole genome screening may be used as first line of test and FISH may be used for confirmation of screening result, screening of  family members and prenatal diagnosis., Context: INTRODUCTION: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is caused by hemizygous  microdeletions on chromosome 22. 22q11.2DS has several presentations including  Di George's syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome or Shprintzen's syndrome and  it is the most frequent microdeletion syndrome in the general population  (prevalence estimated at 1/4000 births, de novo: 90%). The inheritance of the  syndrome (10%) is autosomal dominant. Most people with 22q11.2DS are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of  chromosome 22 in each cell. A small percentage of affected individuals have  shorter deletions in the same region (contiguous gene deletion syndrome). The general features of 22q11.2DS vary widely (more than 180 phenotypic  presentations) and the syndrome is under diagnosed. Characteristic symptoms may  include congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, neuromuscular problems,","27822311, 27822311, 27822311, 24056568, 24056568, 25523123",MIR137 is the key gene mediator of the syndromic obesity phenotype of patients with 1p21. 3 microdeletions.,"22003227, 27822311"

There was a good linear relationship (r =  .97) between administered dose and total area under the curve at each dose  level. Only about 4% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged  nalmefene, whereas up to 60% was excreted as a beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase  hydrolysable conjugate(s) of nalmefene. In the second study, six healthy men  were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were  obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours. A dosing schedule of 20 mg  q12h was then started and continued for seven days. Plasma samples were  collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no  clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day  administration period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Context:  OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and  place in therapy of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) product, QTERN  (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets.

Saxagliptin may  suppress the increased secretion of glucagon associated with dapagliflozin. The, Context: The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is a major target of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A  variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent  seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit  composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and  loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of  antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure  mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR  function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic ""tone"" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR  efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes  during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional, Context: resulting in increased production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma.

The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching  status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is evident as genetic disorders that result from defects in genes critical for homologous recombinational repair (HRR) pathway, such as At","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,, Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: Brca1 deficiency leads to the development of breast cancer. We previously found  that Brca1 deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway. Reduced expression of  Brca1 was highly correlated with increased activated Akt in human breast cancer  samples. Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in  Brca1-deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. Defective homologous  recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to tumorigenesis in Brca1 deficiency. Here, we show that Akt1 promotes chromosome instability in  Brca1-deficent cells. DNA breaks in Brca1-deficent cells are aberrantly joined  into complex chromosome rearrangements by a process dependent on Akt1. Depletion of Akt1 increases HR in Brca1-mutant cells, which is rescued by expression of  wild-type, but not mutant Akt1 with deletion of Brca1-binding domain.  Mechanistically, activated Akt1 in Brca1-deficient cells impairs Chk1 nuclear, Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine  chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like  Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair. This review presents the  main mechanisms and pathways of homologous recombination repair (synthesis-dependent single strand annealing, constitution of Hollidayjunctions  with their resolution mechanisms and repair by break induced replication), the  proteins involved in it and their contribution to oncogenesis.","12427531, 20298636, 23675572, 22665067, 23678008, 22276468",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki include salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1. These genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis. The Hippo pathway,","Context: and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five  sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome. Loss of  endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative,  invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular  apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Exploring the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration is one of the main  challenges in biology and biomedicine. Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway., Context: including humans, in a high-throughput manner. Here, we report, for the first  time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the  Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved  transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took  advantage of the very recently developed ""unit assembly"" strategy to assemble  two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex  chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently  injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2% of the injected F(0) fertile flies,  we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable  modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications  of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed., Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X.

It is currently","Context: the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program  illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced  definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in  the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target  disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for  druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene,  protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism  of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging  integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,  drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging  anti-Aβ drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs  in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the  β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of  cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1).

In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH., Context: Introduction Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive  cancer with poor survival that is difficult to treat due to a lack of targeted  options. Conventional therapies targeting hormone receptors (HR) and human  epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) are ineffective and often chemotherapy is  standard-of-care. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  comprised of an active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, bound to a humanized  monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblastic cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2).  Trop-2 is highly expressed on the surface of TNBC cells, making it an attractive  target. Areas covered We explore the mechanism, pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan. A literature search was conducted via  PubMed using keywords such as 'sacituzumab govitecan,' and 'metastatic TNBC.'  Expert opinion Sacituzumab govitecan has promising survival benefits in patients with previously treated mTNBC based on data from the ASCENT trial.

Migraine occurs  in nearly 1 in 7 individuals between 15 and 49 years of age and is 3 times more  frequent in women than in men. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently  approved 3 new humanized monoclonal antibodies that target calcitonin  gene-related peptide (CGRP): erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. The  agents either bind to the CGRP receptor (erenumab) or bind to the CGRP ligand  (fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and block its binding to the receptor. All 3  products are indicated for preventative treatment of episodic or chronic migraine in adults. The available studies to date document that these agents  reduce migraine attacks. The CGRP monoclonal antibodies offer patients new  options once they have exhausted other treatments., Context: or are already under use for different disorders but could be beneficial for the  treatment of Chronic urticaria.

This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution  based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of  protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different  algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated  using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying  complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and  combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total  >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported  proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported  proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of  search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The  results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying, Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins. All alpha-Kaps contain a central domain composed  of eight approximately 40 amino acid, tandemly arranged, armadillo-like (Arm)  repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of, Context: the use of adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the standard treatment for these  tumors, although several studies have documented that the current standard  combination chemotherapy is suboptimal. Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: Now that complete genome sequences are available for a variety of organisms, the  elucidation of potential gene products function is a central goal in the  post-genome era. Domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the  functional association of the component proteins. Here, we took a new approach  to the analysis of the structural features of the proteins involved in fusion  events. An exhaustive survey of fusion events within 30 completely sequenced  genomes and subsequent structure annotations to the component proteins at a SCOP  superfamily level with hidden Markov models was carried out. A domain fusion map  was then constructed. The results revealed that proteins with the class alpha/beta fold are frequently involved in fusion events, around 86% of the  total 676 assigned single-domain fusion pairs including at least one component  protein belonging to the alpha/beta fold class. Moreover, the domain fusion map in our work may offer an attractive framework for designing chimeric enzymes  following Nature's lead, and may give useful hints for exploring the  evolutionary history of proteins.

Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females). The treatment group (n = 59) received auricular acupuncture in Shen, Context: There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in  further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation., Context:  The use of alternative medicine for smoking cessation have been increasing  steadily in recent years. A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools. The subjects were separated into two groups: 159  students were treated with acupuncture on the anti-smoking acupoints of the ear, which is known to be effective for cessation of smoking (case group), and 79  students were treated at other sites of the ear (control group). The acupuncture  treatment was alternately administered at each side of the ears on a weekly, Context: treatment group showed a significant decrease in the nicotine withdrawal symptom  score. Smoking cessation rate showed no significant difference between the  treatment group (27.1%) and the control group (20.3%) at the end of treatment.  There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about three indications for bupropion. They are: 1. As an antidepressant - this is the indication for which bupropion was originally developed. 2. As a tobacco use","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials,  bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile., Context: BACKGROUND: Bupropion has been available in the United States since 1989.  Initially a thrice-daily immediate-release formulation, a twice-daily  sustained-release formulation followed in 1996, and, in August 2003, a  once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression). CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion is an effective and well tolerated smoking cessation  intervention. Further studies with long term follow-up will be useful in, Context: rates at 12 months in 2 studies were 23.1 and 30.3% with bupropion, whereas  values for placebo were 12.4 and 15.6%. Continuous abstinence rates at 12  months, available from 1 trial, were 18.4% with bupropion and 5.6% with placebo.  Furthermore, bupropion was associated with significantly higher quitting rates  than nicotine patch in a comparative study. Combination therapy with bupropion  and nicotine patch provided slightly higher abstinence rates than bupropion  alone, although differences were not statistically significant. The combination  was superior to nicotine patch alone. Data from a preliminary report of long  term bupropion treatment (52 weeks) showed that the drug was associated with significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months.

Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).  Our results suggest that the high-activity allele class of MAOA-u VNTR in males  may be involved in susceptibility to a persistent course of methamphetamine, Context:  OBJECTIVE: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that  metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy. METHODS: In a sample of 118 Scandinavian patients with treatment-resistant  depression who are naive to MAOI therapy, we investigated the associations  between a common MAOA functional promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR),, Context: METHODS: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the  influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and  diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals:  20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate  that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD., Context: impact on the understanding of the nature of constitutional factors making  individuals vulnerable for e.g. substance abuse and the link between low  platelet MAO activity and type 2 alcoholism, recently confirmed on non-human  primates, is discussed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the association  between platelet MAO and behaviour are discussed and evidence that common  transcriptional factors, e.g. within the AP-2 family, regulating both the  expression of platelet MAO and components of central monoaminergic systems, such  as synthetizing enzymes, receptors and transporters, are presented. A hypothesis  is put forward, that such common transcription factors may not directly regulate platelet MAO expression, but rather mitochondrial number or outer membrane  surface., Context: The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)  inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor,  3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase  (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. In vitro, carbidopa,  benserazide and NSD-1015 all potently inhibited hepatic MAO A and B activity  (IC(50) 10-50 micro M). In ex vivo studies following systemic drug  administration, NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg ip) produced 88% and 96% inhibition of  hepatic and striatal MAO A and B activity respectively. Carbidopa (12.5 mg/kg  i.p.) and benserazide (50 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on striatal MAO A activity or hepatic MAO B activity. However, they inhibited striatal MAO B activity by 45  +/- 10% and 36 +/- 10% respectively. In conclusion, carbidopa and benserazide  may not only protect L-DOPA from peripheral decarboxylation, but also increase striatal dopamine content through MAO inhibition.

The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the  loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the  cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated.

However, their integration-site preferences and the","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the, Context: of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis  by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes.  Co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter  could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR).","21247248, 16717285, 14683449, 24158830, 7624311, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

DISCUSSION: Literature on D-MER is limited to one published qualitative research  study and two published case reports. As a result, lactation professionals and  other providers in the healthcare setting rarely recognize this condition. CONCLUSIONS: The case studies presented here provide evidence for the presence  of D-MER. Research is needed to better understand its pathophysiology,  incidence, and treatment options., Context: Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER) is an abrupt emotional ""drop"" that occurs  in some women just before milk release and continues for not more than a few  minutes. The brief negative feelings range in severity from wistfulness to  self-loathing, and appear to have a physiological cause. The authors suggest  that an abrupt drop in dopamine may occur when milk release is triggered,  resulting in a real or relative brief dopamine deficit for affected women. Clinicians can support women with D-MER in several ways; often, simply knowing  that it is a recognized phenomenon makes the condition tolerable. Further study  is needed., Context:  Dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) results in waves of negative emotions  that last from shortly before initial milk ejection until baby starts to feed  vigorously Symptoms may decrease by 3 months or they may continue throughout the breastfeeding period. This report is a case study of an Australian mother who  experienced D-MER with her fourth child.","29115857, 20443435, 21645333, 29115857, 21645333, 20443435","Dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria, or undesirable feeling that occurs with the MER and continues for no more than a few minutes.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. This is mentioned in the context when it discusses methods to accelerate the identification of tumour antigens by amplifying gene products that are selectively or prefer","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with  the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs., Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.

To date there is no universal  vaccine that prevents these diseases. In this work, five antigens discovered by reverse vaccinology were expressed in a form suitable for large-scale  manufacturing and formulated with adjuvants suitable for human use. The vaccine  adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide induced bactericidal antibodies in mice against 78% of a panel of 85 meningococcal strains representative of the global  population diversity. The strain coverage could be increased to 90% and above by  the addition of CpG oligonucleotides or by using MF59 as adjuvant. The vaccine, Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival.

Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in  7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex  Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with  phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four  other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of  six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31. Our case reinforces FERD3L as candidate gene for intellectual disability and  suggested that genes located in 3p21.3 can be related to hyper IgE phenotype., Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a relatively common craniosynostosis disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified  in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The TWIST gene product is a  transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains.

[(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a  new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears  to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as  a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome. As a consequence we advise to routinely perform mutation analysis of the FGFR1, 2, and 3 genes in children with  non-syndromic trigonocephaly., Context: additional malformations and without chromosome breakage, who fits this narrow  definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation  in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the  protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk  for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance.  Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation,  while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is  very low., Context: transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains.

Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical  complications of laparoscopic surgery. Conversely, conservative surgical  treatment of ovarian endometriomas in symptomatic women does not impair IVF or  intracytoplasmic sperm injection success rates., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs.  PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an, Context: OBJECTIVES: Endometriomas are rare in pregnancy. May be difficult to diagnose  and may cause significant complications at any stage during gestation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The author presents 2 cases of ovarian endometriomas  diagnosed and treated surgically in 14 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course., Context: natural pregnancy rate in the control group. Pregnancy rates in patients  receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15)  before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively. In post-menopausal women, the  median (quartile) age at menopause was similar in the study (n=9) and control  groups (n=6) [48 (45-52) versus 49 (44-52) years, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced  long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no  contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve  the success rates of fertility treatment., Context: visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the  non-operated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients  who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower  antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with  non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present  ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and  live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF  outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of  endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins.","15136074, 15136074, 15136074, 11526777, 24231199, 21679474","Yes, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.","12419041, 15136074, 17399914, 23759693, 21561807, 8737616, 16034960, 7202738, 21679474, 18425908, 21764126, 2943896, 11526777, 22695290, 23277022, 24231199"
Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"No, evolocumab does not target an enzyme. Instead, it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies  inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it  for degradation. Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show  that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly  limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and, Context: A model to quantitatively characterize the effect of evinacumab, an  investigational monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3  (ANGPTL3) on lipid trafficking is needed. A quantitative systems pharmacology  (QSP) approach was developed to predict the transient responses of different  triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles in response to evinacumab  administration. A previously published hepatic lipid model was modified to  address specific queries relevant to the mechanism of evinacumab and its effect  on lipid metabolism. Modifications included the addition of intermediate-density  lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein compartments to address the modulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by evinacumab, ANGPTL3 biosynthesis and  clearance, and a target-mediated drug disposition model. A sensitivity analysis  guided the creation of virtual patients (VPs). The drug-free QSP model was found to agree well with clinical data published with the initial hepatic liver model  over simulations ranging from 20 to 365 days in duration. The QSP model,  including the interaction between LPL and ANGPTL3, was validated against, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site.","24661068, 25282519, 24961142, 34327869, 14747475, 8798387",Evolocumab (AMG145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that demonstrated marked reductions in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in statin-intolerant patients.,"24859266, 24694531, 24662398, 24691094, 25470376, 24825642, 24953393, 25079474, 24953396, 25002170, 24678979, 24598985, 24661068, 24477778, 24481874, 24255061, 25282519, 25282520, 24509273, 25052769, 24284914, 24373748, 24961142, 25410046"

The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A→I) that is catalyzed by the members of the  Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are  identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a  method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate  RNA-seq data has not been published so far. Even more surprising,, Context: The advent of deep sequencing technologies has greatly improved the study of  complex eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes, providing the unique opportunity  to investigate posttranscriptional molecular mechanisms as alternative splicing  and RNA editing at single base-pair resolution. RNA editing by adenosine  deamination (A-to-I) is widespread in humans and can lead to a variety of  biological effects depending on the RNA type or the RNA region involved in the  editing modification. Hereafter, we describe an easy and reproducible  computational protocol for the identification of candidate RNA editing sites in  human using deep transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and genome (DNA-Seq) sequencing data.","24163250, 24163250, 24163250, 24163250, 28049429, 25577380","RADAR is a rigorously annotated database of A-to-I RNA editing.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, according to the context, two interaction partners for the protein GATA1 are FOG-1 and PU.1. These interactions were identified through studies involving point mutants of GATA1 and physical interaction assays such as mammal","Context: errors mainly in terms of false positive data sets and reducing therefore the  quality of any derived information. Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms. We compared the results of the different methods by  applying five different performance measurement metrices. Moreover, the  parameters of the methods that constitute the filter have been checked on how, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization., Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes.","19534736, 18844071, 12032775, 28161276, 21632975, 16888367","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding  that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for  cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell  lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response, Context: METHODS: We report here the making of MRG002, a novel HER2-targeted antibody  drug conjugate (ADC), and preclinical characterization including pharmacology,  pharmacodynamics and toxicology and discuss its potential as a novel agent for  treating patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. RESULTS: MRG002 exhibited similar antigen binding affinity but much reduced  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity compared to  trastuzumab. In addition to potent in vitro cytotoxicity, MRG002 showed tumor  regression in both high- and medium-to-low HER2 expressing in vivo xenograft  models. Furthermore, MRG002 showed enhanced antitumor activity when used in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Main findings from toxicology studies  are related to the payload and are consistent with literature report of other  ADCs with monomethyl auristatinE. CONCLUSION: MRG002 has demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and potent  antitumor activities in the breast and gastric PDX models with varying levels of  HER2 expression, and/or resistance to trastuzumab or T-DM1. A phase I clinical, Context: Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein  (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief  that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk,  stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly  characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets  only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP  granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and  adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for  cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct  responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific  RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified. Previously underappreciated, transcriptome  profiling in the RG may contribute to understanding human diseases associated  with RNP dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegeneration., Context:  RGS proteins are defined by the presence of a semiconserved RGS domain that  confers the GTPase-activating activity of these proteins toward certain G alpha  subunits.

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, ficolin-3 activates the lectin complement pathway. This is stated explicitly in the context, where it is mentioned that ""ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the circulation"" and","Context: (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were  all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to  SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that  Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore,  Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease  activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption  in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration., Context: as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has  been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of  Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common  pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause  extraintestinal, opportunistic infections., Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern.

Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition  molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic  variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene  was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms  was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by  production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied  10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several  polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was  particularly interesting.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, bats are thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS. This conclusion is drawn from the genetic similarity between MERS-CoV and certain bat coronaviruses like Tylonycteris bat coron","Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed., Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor.

They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life  threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in  humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections,  and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This  highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these  viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses,, Context: A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the  causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012. The virus was  termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is taken  notice of important coronavirus caused severe diseases to human after the  outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. There is a lot  of unknown characterization regarding MERS-CoV because of less than one year  after finding the first case. MERS-CoV was related to the 2C betacoronavirus  clade and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and  Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Thus, bats are thought to be natural hosts of this virus. Recently, there were reports supposed to be cases of human to human  infection. There are growing concerns about spread of infection.","28616501, 25791336, 25791336, 25791336, 28643204, 24769571",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. They are RNA-containing foci that form in response to stress exposure and are composed of various RNA binding proteins or proteins involved in RNA metabolism and,"Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist  longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular  change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state., Context:  Stress granules (SGs) are RNA-containing cytoplasmic foci formed in response to  stress exposure. Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been  described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications). Most of these components are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or are involved in RNA  metabolism and translation.

Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context: receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection  Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs. The drug works through  angiotensin receptor blockage via valsartan as well as neprilysin inhibition  with sacubitril. This represented a new milestone in managing heart failure  patients and provided yet another therapy in our armamentarium. This article  reviews the stages that led to the development of this drug, the failure of its  preceding agents, the lessons we have learnt, and the current trials of Entresto  for new indications., Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With, Context: WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity  and mortality worldwide. Advanced therapies have prolonged survival in patients  with advanced heart failure, but pharmacotherapeutic optimization remains the  mainstay of treatment. It has been over 10 years since the last  mortality-reducing medication has been approved by the Food and Drug  Administration. This article reviews the background, current knowledge and data  supporting the use of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto(®) ), the newly  FDA-approved medication that dually inhibits angiotensin and neprilysin, in the  treatment of heart failure. METHODS: A literature search was performed (January 1980 to August 2015) using  PubMed and the search terms were as follows: neprilysin inhibitor, heart  failure, endopeptidase, natriuretic peptides, angiotensin, omapatrilat, LCZ696, valsartan and sacubitril. Peer-reviewed, published clinical trials, review  articles, relevant treatment guidelines and prescribing information documents  were identified and reviewed for relevance. Additionally, reference citations, Context: At Day 28, 56.9% of the subjects indicated improvement compared to baseline on  the modified CGI of change (CGI-C); 21.4% reported no change. Improvements were  also observed on the UPDRS II and the PDQ-8. Benefit from entacapone appeared to  be relatively uniform across subgroups (e.g., number of daily levodopa doses,  use of other anti-PD medications). STUDY LIMITATIONS: The results of this study may be biased due to factors  inherent in open-label, community-based trials (e.g., compliance). This is,  however, reflective of everyday clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: In this naturalistic, real-life study, the addition of entacapone to levodopa therapy provided benefits in quality of life and activities of daily  living for a substantial proportion of PD patients experiencing wearing-off.","21176430, 28676030, 29532764, 26976916, 26992459, 18922214","Entresto is composed of sacubitril and valsartan.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.

The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven  imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported, Context: patients, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features  only. Interestingly, this microdeletion of 16 p13.3 was found in a young child  with an unexplained syndromic condition due to an indistinct etiological  diagnosis.

RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross  chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations. Translocations and inversions  involving chromosome band 16p13.3 form the minority of CBP mutations, whereas microdeletions occur more frequently (about 10%).

To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes.

CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans.

Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism., Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3  administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic  rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to, Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function.

In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy  which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart.  In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In  addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the  frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The decrease in T3 serves as an indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to  increased mortality. In animal models, it can be shown that in pressure  overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy a decrease of thyroid hormone receptor levels occurs. Cardiac function can be improved by increasing expression of  thyroid hormone receptors mediated by adeno-associated virus based gene  transfer. The failing heart may develop a ""hypothyroid"" status contributing to, Context: RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005).

We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.

CONCLUSION: This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of  cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia., Context: Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may  interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. However, the  literature on this issue is conflicting. In investigating the relationship  between pregnancy-associated complications and the presence of thrombophilia  risk factors, we studied the records of 414 women who had been examined for  inherited and acquired thrombophilia in the period 1996 to 2006 because of pregnancy-associated complications. Of a total of 885 pregnancies among the  women, 397 were recorded as foetal loss/intrauterine foetal death during the  first (62 %), second (25 %) or third trimester (13 %). One-hundred-and-two (25 %) women had had a thromboembolic event during one of their pregnancies, and 98  (24 %) had had pre-eclampsia on at least one occasion. Intrauterine growth  restriction was found in 105 (25 %) of the women, and 29 (7 %) suffered, Context: BACKGROUND: Although some paternal components to the predisposition to  pre-eclampsia have been demonstrated recently, it is not known whether such  paternal factors play a role to thrombophilia-related perinatal mortality.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the paternal and maternal contribution to perinatal  mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Data from a prospective registry of perinatal mortality in a Dutch  healthcare region were used. Between December 1999 and May 2000, the prevalence  of thrombophilia was studied in 74 women with a history of perinatal mortality  (female cases) and 54 of their male partners (male cases). Seventy-one healthy  unrelated women after uneventful pregnancies only and 66 of their male partners were used as controls. SETTING: Obstetric outpatient clinic in a regional hospital (Remierde Graaf  Group, Deflt). METHODS: Presence of various coagulation abnormalities, hyperhomocysteinaemia  and anticardiolipins was investigated. RESULTS: The frequency of antithrombin deficiency (12% vs 0%), increased  activated protein C (APC) resistance (32% vs 6%), total protein S deficiency  (11% vs 1%) and elevated factor VIII:C activity (43% vs 17%) was significantly, Context:  PURPOSE: To determine if thrombophilia is a risk factor for placenta-mediated  pregnancy complications (PMPC) (i.e., preeclampsia, intrauterine growth  restriction (IUGR), placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death and recurrent  pregnancy loss). METHODS: A 5-year retrospective cohort study. Ongoing pregnancies in women with  an antecedent PMPC with thrombophilia were compared with the pregnancies in  similar women without thrombophilia. The main outcome measures were mean birth weight deviations, corrected for gestational age, and recurrence of PMPC.  Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was employed for thromboprophylaxis only.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the given context, it was shown to exert neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced toxicity in SK-N-SH cells and","Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases., Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C. In hippocampal slice preparations, whole-cell patch clamp  experiments showed that hesperidin reduced the frequency of spontaneous, Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 µl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused  oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted  super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial, Context: effects against a broad group of diseases. Citrus fruits and juices are a rich  source of vitamin C and flavonoids, with a potential effect on the inflammatory  response. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evidence the potential anti-inflammatory effects of  the flavonoids hesperidin for its possible therapeutic application against  diverse pathologies. METHOD: In the present review, available literature about the anti-inflammatory  effects of hesperidin is reported and discussed. Moreover, we also discuss the  chemistry, bioavailability and proposed mechanisms of action of hesperidin. RESULTS: Hesperidin is a flavonoid present in high concentration in citrus species and has numerous biological properties, principally antioxidant and  anti-inflammatory. Several studies have been performed in order to evaluate the  effects of hesperidin as anti-inflammatory agent using cellular and animal models and few clinical trials. Hesperidin treatment decreased inflammatory  mediators and exerted significant antioxidant effects.

We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified  NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a  member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation., Context:  We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are chemically reactive intermediates formed during the metabolism of certain drugs within the body. They can bind to cellular proteins and are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction. Although the reactive metabolite hypothesis is logical,  it has important implications for drug development, and we need to develop ways, Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites.

In this review, we present a critique of such  reactive metabolites and evaluate the evidence linking them to observed toxic  effects. Methodology for the characterization of reactive metabolites has advanced greatly in recent years, and is summarized first. Next, we consider the  inhibition of key metabolic enzymes by electrophilic metabolites, as well as  unfavorable drug-drug interactions that may ensue.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies. Therapists need to have precise knowledge of human, Context: Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical  evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma., Context:  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case demonstrates  that patients are sometimes reluctant to disclose folk medical treatments to Western physicians, and the proper diagnosis may depend upon the prowess of the  neuroradiologist., Context:  Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical evacuation.

Additionally, most patients have associated neurolog","Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this  patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a  genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation., Context: The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is  characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal  insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and  dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The, Context: diagnosis is often difficult in all but the classical presentation. The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract. Those bearing mutations had the classical  triple A syndrome of achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a  progressive neurological syndrome. We identified a spectrum of associated, Context: change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported., Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics.
