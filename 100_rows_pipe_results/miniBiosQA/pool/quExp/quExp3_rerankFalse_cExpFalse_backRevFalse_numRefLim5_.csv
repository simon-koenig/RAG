Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Achalasia is a disorder of","Context: dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later,, Context: the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within, Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this, Context: North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed, Context: The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","No, the context does not provide information about any clinical trials involving an H3 R antagonist called CEP-26401 and its effects on cognition.","Context: The number of global clinical trials including Japan is increasing but still  much lower than those including the USA and Europe. The regulatory requirements  for clinical trials have been harmonized among Japan, USA, and Europe, and the, Context: in clinical trials, Context: quality of clinical trials is kept high in these regions. Xofluza (baloxavir  marboxil) for influenza approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE Designation System  is a good example of clinical trials including Japan. To include Japan in more, Context: individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  a systemic autoimmune disease which affects multiple organs. Cutaneous lupus, Context: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral, Context: erythematosus (CLE) includes skin symptoms seen in SLE and cutaneous-limited LE.  Although immune abnormalities, as well as heritable, hormonal and environmental  factors, are involved in the pathology of LE, the actual pathogenesis is still, Context: Type I interferons (IFN) are primarily regarded as an inhibitor of viral  replication. However, type I IFN, mainly IFNalpha, plays a major role in  activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Systemic lupus, Context: unclear.
