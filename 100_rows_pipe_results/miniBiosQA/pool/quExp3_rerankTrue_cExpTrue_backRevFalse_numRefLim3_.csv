The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They form effector complexes with PIWI proteins to repress transposable elements, which helps preserve genomic integrity. Additionally, they can induce transcriptional and post","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context:  PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germline-specific small RNAs that form  effector complexes with PIWI proteins (Piwi-piRNA complexes) and play critical  roles for preserving genomic integrity by repressing transposable elements (TEs).

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on what the ""minimal genome build"" is. Instead, it discusses the concept of a ""minimal genome,"" which remains elusive due to the strong context-dependency and variation in","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits H4 Lys 20 methylation. This is suggested by the cell cycle-regulated expression of PR-Set7, which localizes to mitotic chromosomes and increases H4 Lys","Context: It is almost ten years since senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs)  were first described in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Since then, a number  of factors have been identified that affect SAHF formation, including HMGA  proteins, structural components of SAHFs. However, the involvement of epigenetic  marks in SAHF formation remains unclear. Our recent study, combining microscopy  and ChIP-seq approaches, revealed that SAHFs are formed through spatial  repositioning of the genome. This occurs according to certain chromatin features  that are correlated with, but do not require, the repressive marks histone H3  trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3. These repressive marks are segregated from each other within SAHFs, forming layered high-order chromatin  structures (HOCS). During the dynamic change in HOCS as SAHFs form, the linear  epigenomic profiles of these repressive marks are highly static. This is in marked contrast to the spreading of repressive marks occurring during embryonic  cell differentiation. Thus the layered HOCS of SAHFs is likely achieved mainly  through the spatial rearrangement of pre-existing heterochromatin, rather than, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from  the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors.

More then 97% of persons with achondroplasia have a  Gly380Arg mutation in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor  receptor (FGFR) 3 gene. Mutations in the FGFR3 gene also result in  hypochondroplasia, the lethal thanatophoric dysplasias, the recently described  SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans)  dysplasia, and two craniosynostosis disorders: Muenke coronal craniosynostosis  and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans. Recent evidence suggests that  the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees  of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively active. Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar  observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting  phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis.

These events were accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen  species (ROS), disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)) and a decrease in the ratio of mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bax content; emodin also  promoted the levels of GADD153 and GRP78. The free radical scavenger  N-acetylcysteine and caspase inhibitors markedly blocked emodin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that emodin mediated oxidative  injury (DNA damage) based on ROS production and ER stress based on the levels of  GADD153 and GRP78 that acts as an early and upstream change in the cell death","23567243, 23536162, 19331169","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not implicated in resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. The context only mentions TR beta gene mutations as the cause of RTH","Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, according to the context, EZH2 has an impact on chromatin. The overexpression of EZH2 in pancreatic cancer cells results in compact chromatin domains and transcriptional repression. However, the removal","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context: PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the  anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and  human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival. RESULTS: We detected nuclear overexpression of EZH2 in pancreatic cancer cell  lines and in 71 of 104 (68%) cases of human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. EZH2  nuclear accumulation was more frequent in poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinomas (31 of 34 cases; P<0.001). We found that genetic depletion of  EZH2 results in reexpression of p27(Kip1) and decreased pancreatic cancer cell  proliferation. Moreover, we showed that EZH2 depletion sensitized pancreatic, Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy","24469045, 18980972, 27903964",Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms,"24077602, 21892963, 22821416, 18980972, 9214638, 25680271, 20631058, 15520282, 19954516, 22966008, 24040281, 23688634, 25617436, 19026781"

Ceritin,"Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK.

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following  reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of  pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two  fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously  produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification  results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed  for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. The proposed deep learning, Context:  BACKGROUND: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate  melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger  groups of dermatologists are lacking.

It utilizes a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: oncogenes, whose loss or overexpression respectively has diagnostic and  prognostic significance. It seems that microRNAs act as major regulators of gene  expression. In this review, we discuss microRNAs' role in cancer and how  microRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their gene targets.  Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites has indicated several  novel potential gene targets involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastatic  mechanisms. Matching computational prediction analysis together with microarray  data seems the best method for microRNA gene target identification. MicroRNAs  together with transcription factors generate a complex combinatorial code regulating gene expression. Thus, manipulation of microRNA-transcription factor  gene networks may be provides a novel approach for developing cancer therapies.","21406606, 19324892, 19721809","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001).

What is included in the LACE Index?,"Yes, the LACE index includes four parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months. This information is provided explicitly in the context.","Context: of LACE Index for Readmission - Length of stay (days), Acute (emergent)  admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of ED visits within six months  (LACE) and Patients At Risk of Hospital Readmission (PARR) using New Zealand  hospital admissions. This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542., Context: RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial  neoplasm (n = 352). Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02× increased  odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031,  CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic  curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day  readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts  a 0.98× reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99,  C-statistic = 0.70). But LACE+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P =  0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the LACE+ index is not  yet suitable as a prediction model for 30-day readmission in a brain tumor  population., Context: Predictive models for hospital readmission rates are in high demand because of  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Readmission  Reduction Program (HRRP).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is suggested by the fact that genetic disorders affecting genes critical for homologous recombinational repair (HRR), such as Ataxia telangie","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context: DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually  cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination, antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context: Smc1-Smc3 cohesin complex is loaded onto chromatin around the DSB to support  recombination-mediated DSB repair. In this study, we investigated whether Ctf18,  a factor implicated in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, is  involved in DSB repair in budding yeast. Ctf18 was recruited to HO-endonuclease  induced DSB sites in an Mre11-dependent manner and to damaged chromatin in G2/M  phase-arrested cells. The ctf18 mutant cells showed high sensitivity to  DSB-inducible genotoxic agents and defects in DSB repair, as well as defects in  damage-induced recombination between sister chromatids and between homologous  chromosomes. These results suggest that Ctf18 is involved in damage-induced homologous recombination.","12427531, 20298636, 17636314",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki include salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1.

Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression.

Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females). The treatment group (n = 59) received auricular acupuncture in Shen, Context:  The use of alternative medicine for smoking cessation have been increasing  steadily in recent years. A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools. The subjects were separated into two groups: 159  students were treated with acupuncture on the anti-smoking acupoints of the ear, which is known to be effective for cessation of smoking (case group), and 79  students were treated at other sites of the ear (control group). The acupuncture  treatment was alternately administered at each side of the ears on a weekly, Context: different between the case and control groups, but the case group showed a  tendency of reduction in the taste of tobacco and the intensity of the desire to  smoke. In addition, the reduction in cigarette consumption was not significant,  but the tendency of reduction in the study group was significant. It is believed  that the site of auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation is not important.  However, there was a significant tendency in terms of the reduction in cigarette  consumption, the taste of tobacco and the intensity of the desire to smoke in  the case group, indicating that auricular acupuncture in smoking cessation has  some effect.","17698433, 15861492, 15861492","Ear acupressure (EAP) and ear acupuncture have been used for smoking cessation, and some positive results have been reported.

Additionally, bupropion is currently being tested in clinical","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials,  bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL).

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss.

METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic  diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 34) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome are brachycephaly (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad,  depressed nasal bridge (65 percent), a high forehead (56 percent), ptosis (53 percent), and prominent auricular crura (56 percent). Furthermore, using  different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were  identified in 71 percent of patients., Context:  The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited  craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription  factor gene TWIST1. This syndrome has hitherto not been associated with an increased risk of cancer. However, recent studies, using a murine breast tumor  model, have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that  the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers. Here, we report a novel association between the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and breast  cancer.

The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number.

One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at  different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for  batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm  implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides  allele-specific estimates of copy number.

In silico tools  to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have  evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its  classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA  mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from  InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do  predict pathogenicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.595, P < 0.001). However, we discovered  31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population  allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a  second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm  their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing  variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert  classification teams.","21646462, 30371827, 25871441","Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders.

Conventional therapies targeting hormone receptors (HR) and human  epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) are ineffective and often chemotherapy is  standard-of-care. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  comprised of an active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, bound to a humanized  monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblastic cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2).  Trop-2 is highly expressed on the surface of TNBC cells, making it an attractive  target.

DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs. PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher, Context: total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an  IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical  complications of laparoscopic surgery. Conversely, conservative surgical  treatment of ovarian endometriomas in symptomatic women does not impair IVF or  intracytoplasmic sperm injection success rates., Context: recommended for women above the age of 40 and for large endometriomas. Except  for pelvic clearance, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that surgical  treatment of endometrioma is better than medical treatment with respect to the  long-term relief of symptoms and quality of life. Laparoscopic excision of  ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over  expectant management.

Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved.

Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that stress granules ""transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress.""","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN.

La complicación más frecuente es la pancreatitis, que  puede llevar a falla multiorgánica o insuficiencia pancreática. La  quilomicronemia familiar también afecta la calidad de vida, las relaciones  sociales y el desarrollo profesional.

To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes.

Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are chemically reactive species that are formed during the biotransformation of drugs in the body. They can bind covalently to cellular proteins and other macromolecules, leading to toxic","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the  liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging electrophilic reactive metabolites generated by human P450 biotransformation.  These assays use a GFP reporter system that detects DNA damage through induction  of the SOS response and a GFP reporter to control for cytotoxicity.
