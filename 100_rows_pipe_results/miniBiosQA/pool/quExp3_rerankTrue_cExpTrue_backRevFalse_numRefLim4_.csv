Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene in humans encodes for DNA polymerase θ. This is explicitly stated in the context. The gene is referred to as ""POLQ"" and it encodes pol θ in mammalian cells.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by, Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining.""

It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered).

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye becomes subluxated or dislocated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers that hold it in place. It can be associated with","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a zonular disease where alteration of the zonular fibers  leads progressively to lens dislocation. It is most often associated with  systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome or homocystinuria. Isolated non syndromic ectopia lentis (IEL) is reported in  families with autosomal inheritance, with dominant forms being more common than  recessive. LTBP2 truncating mutations have been described as a cause of autosomal recessive ectopia lentis as a primary or secondary feature in patients  showing ocular (eg, glaucoma) or extraocular manifestations (eg, Marfanoid  habitus). Recently, ADAMTSL4 has been shown to be responsible for isolated, Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes.

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They form effector complexes with PIWI proteins to repress transposable elements, which are mobile DNA sequences that can change their position within a genome, causing mutations","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context:  PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germline-specific small RNAs that form  effector complexes with PIWI proteins (Piwi-piRNA complexes) and play critical  roles for preserving genomic integrity by repressing transposable elements (TEs). Drosophila Piwi transcriptionally silences specific targets through  heterochromatin formation and increases histone H3K9 methylation (H3K9me3) and  histone H1 deposition at these loci, with nuclear RNA export factor variant Nxf2 serving as a co-factor. Using ChEP and DamID-seq, we now uncover a  Piwi/Nxf2-dependent target association with nuclear lamins. Hi-C analysis of  Piwi or Nxf2-depleted cells reveals decreased intra-TAD and increased inter-TAD, Context:  PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a subset of small RNAs predominantly  expressed in the germlines of various species. In Drosophila, the main sources  of piRNAs are transcripts of mobile DNA elements, including active transposons and their wreckage, found on the genome. After maturing from the primary  transcripts, piRNAs are specifically loaded onto germline-specific Argonaute  proteins - Argonaute3, Aubergine and Piwi - collectively referred to as PIWI proteins. Loss of function of PIWI proteins and/or the piRNA loci on the genome  lead to derepression of transposons and causes severe defects in gametogenesis  and fertility.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to describe a minimal genome build. While it mentions the concept of a minimal genome and its challenges, as well as the idea of gene persistence, it does not give specific details about what","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context: identification of ubiquitous template design sequences (templum intentio series,  templints) of human genomes common for disease-associated SNPs, microRNAs and  pyknons. We demonstrate that genome-unique SNP-coding sequences associated with  multiple common human disorders appear assembled from series of ubiquitous short  octamer sequences shared by 5'-UTR pyknons and microRNAs. Our analysis suggests  that units of genetic information encoded in the linear sequences of the 3.6  billion bases of human genome are condensed in approximately 200,000 bases  (0.006%) of 5' UTR pyknons which are represented by hundreds of copies in a  genome and utilized to build genome-unique sequences. Allele-specific sequence variations link disease-associated SNPs to distinct sets of pyknons and  microRNAs, suggesting that increased susceptibility to multiple common human  disorders is associated with global alterations of genome-wide regulatory templates affecting the biogenesis and functions of non-coding RNAs., Context: As a key focus of synthetic biology, building a minimal artificial cell has  given rise to many discussions. A synthetic minimal cell will provide an  appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems  with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and  construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a  cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome. Kinds of approaches, based on bioinformatics and molecular biology, have been  developed and proceeded to derive essential genes and minimal gene sets for the  synthetic minimal genome. Experiments about streamlining genomes of model bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits H4K20me1. According to the second and third contexts, Set7, also known as PR-Set7, is a cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase that mediates","Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.

Data collected included demographic data,, Context: recurrence and progression probability after bacillus Calmette-Guerin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed on 1,062 patients treated with  bacillus Calmette-Guerin and included in 4 Spanish Urological Club for  Oncological Treatment trials. Stepwise multivariate Cox models were used to  determine the effect of prognostic factors. In each patient the weight of all  factors was summed to a total score.

RESULTS: A scoring system was calculated with a score of 0 to 16 for recurrence  and 0 to 14 for progression. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by score, and recurrence and progression probabilities were calculated in each group. For  recurrence the variables were gender, age, grade, tumor status, multiplicity and  associated Tis.

Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human  tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in  primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys. Genomic Southern, Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression  pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in  presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita.

Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures.

Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels.

High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.

This review  article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in  cardiovascular disease., Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a broad class of small non-coding RNAs that control  expression of complementary target messenger RNAs. Dysregulation of miRNAs has  been described in various disease states including cancer and cardiac disease. A  particular miRNA that was consistently reported to be upregulated in both cancer  and various forms of cardiovascular diseases is miR-21. MiR-21 exerts oncogenic  activity and therefore is considered as an oncomir. In the cardiovascular system  miR-21 is enriched in fibroblasts and contributes to the development of fibrosis  and heart failure. MiR-21 therefore emerges as an interesting candidate for the  development of therapeutic strategies against many forms of cancer as well as heart diseases. Indeed, treatment with anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides reduced  breast cancer growth. Inhibition of miR-21 by synthetic miRNA antagonists  (antagomirs) improved heart function in a cardiac disease model.

A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen.

We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs.

In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a computational tool called SSCprofiler uses Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. It integrates sequence, structure and conservation features to achieve high accuracy. The trained classifier is then used","Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes.

This is explicitly stated in the context information provided.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Ewing's sarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour occurring in children  and adolescents and exists in two different clinicopathological entities:  osseous Ewing's sarcoma (OES) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES). Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific  symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22  years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical  exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant  radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine,, Context: A randomized study of 264 children and adults with previously untreated  localized Ewing's sarcoma of bone was undertaken between 1973 and 1978 by 83  institutions of three national study groups: Children's Cancer Study Group,  Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The Intergroup Study  was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral  pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide  (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and  metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival  rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of  disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC  plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to treatment with VAC alone.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01).

Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous  and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to  differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite  considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and  pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here, Context:  Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs.

This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. Inherited mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair can lead to gene rearrangements and may be a prere","Context:  DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair. This review presents the  main mechanisms and pathways of homologous recombination repair, Context: Mismatch repair has a central role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing  DNA replication errors and inhibiting recombination between non-identical  (homeologous) sequences. Defects in mismatch repair have been linked to certain  human cancers, including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and  sporadic tumours. A crucial requirement for tumour cell proliferation is the  maintenance of telomere length, and most tumours achieve this by reactivating telomerase. In both yeast and human cells, however, telomerase-independent  telomere maintenance can occur as a result of recombination-dependent exchanges  between often imperfectly matched telomeric sequences. Here we show that loss of mismatch-repair function promotes cellular proliferation in the absence of  telomerase. Defects in mismatch repair, including mutations that correspond to  the same amino-acid changes recovered from HNPCC tumours, enhance, Context: to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of  dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have  tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce  apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved  complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these  lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an  overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of  DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited  or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to  radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair  and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer., Context:  Mismatch repair has a central role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing  DNA replication errors and inhibiting recombination between non-identical  (homeologous) sequences.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki (Yorkie) are YAP1 and TAZ. In mice, activation of YAP1 increases organ size and causes aberrant tissue expansion, similar","Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome. Loss of  endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative,  invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular  apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in, Context: including humans, in a high-throughput manner. Here, we report, for the first  time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the  Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved  transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took  advantage of the very recently developed ""unit assembly"" strategy to assemble  two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex  chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently  injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2% of the injected F(0) fertile flies,  we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable  modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications  of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed., Context: Elav-positive neurons and the fat body of Drosophila third instar larvae.  Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a  lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly  with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Accordingly,  centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells.  As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc  domains. These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with  genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS: In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals.  Our findings support the model that peripheral heterochromatin matures enhancing  the repression of unwanted genes as cells terminally differentiate.","17980593, 22101275, 22624882, 30384843",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of  search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The  results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying, Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins. All alpha-Kaps contain a central domain composed  of eight approximately 40 amino acid, tandemly arranged, armadillo-like (Arm)  repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.

Secondary-structural prediction  algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of  all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were  investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation.  The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has","27498275, 9391096, 9391096, 19576221","mTOR, TOG5,  DNA-PKcs, HEATR1, Rif1, B56γ, PR65/A, SF3b155, Pds5B","27072897, 26676747, 27549742, 28512144, 27066066, 20007090, 28415797, 28668119, 24120762, 22315229"

However, there have been challenges","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, according to the context, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. The context mentions that methods allowing amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in the tumor can accelerate the identification","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context:  Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens.

However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

Established protocols for experimental  detection and computational inference of CNVs from SNP array and next-generation  sequencing data are available. We present the CNVRanger R/Bioconductor package  which implements a comprehensive toolbox for structured downstream analysis of CNVs. This includes functionality for summarizing individual CNV calls across a  population, assessing overlap with functional genomic regions, and genome-wide  association analysis with gene expression and quantitative phenotypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://bioconductor.org/packages/CNVRanger., Context: tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at  different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for  batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm  implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides  allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for  the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the  marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss.

However, we discovered  31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population  allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a  second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm  their putative pathogenicity.

Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes.

Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function.

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not mention any resource that has been developed to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. The context discusses the identification and investigation of binding sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that, Context: stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: A substantial fraction of phenotypic differences between closely related species  are likely caused by differences in gene regulation. While this has already been  postulated over 30 years ago, only few examples of evolutionary changes in gene  regulation have been verified. Here, we identified and investigated binding  sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPa) aiming to  discover cis-regulatory adaptations on the human lineage. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments in a human cell line, we  found 11,619 putative GABPa binding sites. Through sequence comparisons of the  human GABPa binding regions with orthologous sequences from 34 mammals, we identified substitutions that have resulted in 224 putative human-specific GABPa  binding sites.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that stress granules are ""cytoplasmic granules"" and form ""in the cytoplasm.""","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context:  Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that are formed in cells when  stress occurs. In this study, we found that SGs formed in cells infected with  coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), evidenced with the co-localization of some accepted SG markers in the viral infection-induced granules. We further discovered that  adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1), which can bind  to mRNAs and regulate their translation, was recruited to the SGs in response to high dose of CVB3 by detecting the co-localization of AUF1 with SG markers.  Similar results were also observed in the enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells.  Finally, we demonstrated that AUF1 was also recruited to arsenite-induced SGs,, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context:  Sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto™; LCZ696) is an orally administered  supramolecular sodium salt complex of the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan, which was recently approved in the US and the EU for the treatment of chronic heart  failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In the large,  randomized, double-blind, PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or first hospitalization for  worsening heart failure (composite primary endpoint) significantly more than the  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan, Context: Heart Failure (HF) is one of the main healthcare burdens in the United States  and in the world. Many drugs are approved and used in practice for management of  this condition; including beta blockers, diuretics, aldosterone antagonists,  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI's), and Angiotensin Receptor  Blockers (ARBs).

That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains., Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells., Context:  Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains.

Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results  indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism., Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin does have a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the given contexts, it has been shown to protect against neurotoxicity induced by rotenone, 3-NP, and quinolin","Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%.

In addition to the main features, patients frequently suffer from neurological disturbances. Dermatological abnormalities such as  palmoplantar hyperkeratosis as well as other signs like short stature,  microcephaly and osteoporosis point to the multisystemic character of the disorder. The molecular defect of the autosomal recessively inherited triple A  syndrome is not known. We initially performed a systematic genome linkage scan  in eight triple A families and were able to map the syndrome to a 6 cM interval","27385299, 12752575, 27895694, 11196451","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes, according to the context, low-dose CEP-264","Context: significantly inhibited the growth of HT-29 cell xenograft in SCID mice, and the  mice survival was dramatically improved. At the same time, in xenografted tumors  administrated with AZD-2014, the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 were largely  inhibited, and autophagic markers were significantly increased. Thus, AZD-2014  inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Our results  suggest that AZD-2014 may be further investigated for colorectal cancer therapy  in clinical trials., Context:  The number of global clinical trials including Japan is increasing but still  much lower than those including the USA and Europe. The regulatory requirements  for clinical trials have been harmonized among Japan, USA, and Europe, and the quality of clinical trials is kept high in these regions. Xofluza (baloxavir  marboxil) for influenza approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE Designation System  is a good example of clinical trials including Japan. To include Japan in more global clinical trials, stakeholders should work more collaboratively, and  increase the perception that clinical trials can be conducted appropriately and  efficiently in Japan.

Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, the context provides information about the organs affected by SLE. The text states that Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic disease with multiple organ involvement. Specifically, it mentions","Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect  almost any organ in the human body. Despite significant advancements in our  understanding of SLE over the recent years, its exact mode of onset and disease progression remains elusive. Low concordance rates among monozygotic twins with  SLE (as low as 24%), clustering of disease prevalence around polluted regions  and an urban-rural difference in prevalence all highlight the importance of environmental influences in SLE. Experimental data strongly suggests a complex  interaction between the exposome (or environmental influences) and genome  (genetic material) to produce epigenetic changes (epigenome) that can alter the, Context:  Lupus erythematosus (LE) includes a broad spectrum of diseases from a  cutaneous-limited type to a systemic type. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  a systemic autoimmune disease which affects multiple organs. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes skin symptoms seen in SLE and cutaneous-limited LE.  Although immune abnormalities, as well as heritable, hormonal and environmental  factors, are involved in the pathology of LE, the actual pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, the involvement of various cytokines has been shown in the  pathogenesis of LE. Moreover, some trials with biological agents targeted  specific cytokines are also ongoing for SLE.
