What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Genetic events targeting this modification, particularly at histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), are recurrent and","Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

We analyzed clinical features and  patterns of external and internal ophthalmoplegia of AO, and  neuro-ophthalmologic findings were compared with those of other anti-GQ1b  syndromes with ophthalmoplegia. RESULTS: AO was observed in 11 (32.4%) of the 34 patients with anti-GQ1b  antibody. External ophthalmoparesis was present in all the patients and included  mixed horizontal-vertical (n = 7), pure horizontal (n = 3), and pure vertical  gaze palsy (n = 1). Binocular involvement was common, but unilateral ophthalmoparesis was also observed in 27.3%. Other findings included ptosis (n =  5, 45.5%) and internal ophthalmoplegia (n = 6, 54.5%).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing.

From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions. We found that geometric normalization  with respect to the nucleus shape based on non-rigid image registration has a, Context: Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes  and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene  expression, and differentiation. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization  on three-dimensionally preserved nuclei (3D-FISH), in combination with confocal  microscopy, has become an effective technique for analyzing 3D genome structure  and spatial patterns of defined nucleus targets including entire chromosome  territories and single gene loci. This technique usually requires the  simultaneous visualization of numerous targets labeled with different colored  fluorochromes. Thus, the number of channels and lasers must be sufficient for the commonly used labeling scheme of 3D-FISH, ""one probe-one target"". However,  these channels and lasers are usually restricted by a given microscope system.  This paper presents a method for simultaneously delineating multiple targets in 3D-FISH using limited channels, lasers, and fluorochromes. In contrast to other  labeling schemes, this method is convenient and simple for multicolor 3D-FISH  studies, which may result in widespread adoption of the technique.

Further, future research should concentrate on genome reduction  experiments using P. marinus and the search for additional minimal genomes  should concentrate on autotrophic free-living organisms, Context:  Biologists have been fascinated for more than 2 centuries about how the nucleus  in eukaryotes is organised. Certain of the component parts are well known, but  the overall picture is blurred and often confusing. Small genome species have chromosomes in their interphase nuclei disposed in diffuse chromosome  territories, without any Rabl arrangement, while in large genomes the  chromosomes run string-like through the nucleus with a Rabl orientation following through the cell cycle. What happens in genomes of intermediate size  is either a bit of both, depending on the tissue being studied, or still remains  to be determined. The centromeres are the most dynamic and least well understood, Context:  MOTIVATION: The biological significance of minimal absent words has been  investigated in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. For instance,  three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all  minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based  on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets, Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context: compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most  closely resembles a true minimal genome.

However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context: Methylation of certain lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histone  proteins in nucleosome is of fundamental importance in the regulation of  chromatin structure and gene expression.

The results of the simulations suggest that  Tyr-335 (an absolute conserved residue in PKMTs) may play the role as the, Context: Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been  demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S  histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription.  Recently, we identified a trans-histone pathway in which the interaction between  the N terminus of Set2 and histone H4 Lys(44) is needed to mediate trans-histone  H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation. In the current study, we demonstrate that mutation of the lysine 44 residue in histone H4 or the Set2 mutant lacking the  histone H4 interaction motif leads to intragenic cryptic transcripts, indicating  that the Set2 and histone H4 interaction is important to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. We also determine that histone H2A residues (Leu(116) and  Leu(117)), which are in close proximity to histone H4 Lys(44), are needed for  proper trans-histone H3 Lys(36) methylation. Similar to H4 Lys(44) mutants,, Context: Expression of viral proteins causes important epigenetic changes leading to  abnormal cell growth. Whether viral proteins directly target histone  methyltransferases (HMTs), a key family enzyme for epigenetic regulation, and  modulate their enzymatic activities remains elusive.

Furthermore, these three  HMTs are required for E6 to attenuate p53 transactivation function.  Mechanistically, E6 hampers CARM1- and PRMT1-catalyzed histone methylation at p53-responsive promoters, and suppresses the binding of p53 to chromatinized DNA  independently of E6-mediated p53 degradation. p53 pre-methylated at lysine-372  (p53K372 mono-methylation) by SET7 protects p53 from E6-induced degradation","17517655, 21347206, 17517655, 20139424, 21963854",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

All ten informative cases originated from the paternal  allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at  birth overall was 34.7 years. An exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and  increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation  (c.1138G>A) of the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasia, as well as for mutations  of the related FGFR2 gene causing Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes.

We show that the mutant  genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that  recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series, Context: We previously estimated that 42% of patients with severe developmental disorders  carry pathogenic de novo mutations in coding sequences. The role of de novo  mutations in regulatory elements affecting genes associated with developmental  disorders, or other genes, has been essentially unexplored. We identified de  novo mutations in three classes of putative regulatory elements in almost 8,000  patients with developmental disorders. Here we show that de novo mutations in  highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly  and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a  significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry  pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that  only 0.15% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism. Our  findings represent a robust estimate of the contribution of de novo mutations in  regulatory elements to this genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, and, Context: Achondroplasia is the best described and most common form of the congenital  short-limbed dwarfing conditions. Achondroplasia is apparent at birth and has a  birth prevalence of 1 in 20000-30000 live-born infants. Achondroplasia is  inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, although 80% of cases occur  sporadically as new events in their families. Achondroplasia is caused, in  virtually all of the cases, by a G380R mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Patients with achondroplasia should be evaluated by a  multidisciplinary team of clinicians including geneticists, neurologists, and  orthopedists, since there are numerous bony and neurological complications. The most severe complication results from craniocervical stenosis and medullary and  upper spinal cord compression, which can have devastating and even lethal  sequelae during early childhood. In subsequent decades, including adolescence,, Context: Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000  live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed  dwarfism and macrocephaly.

The current observation of a microdeletion involving  GRIK3, a kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, and the  neurodevelopmental manifestation in the absence of major dysmorphism provides  further clinical implication of the possible role of GRIK family glutamate  receptors in the pathogenesis of developmental delay, Context: Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), first identified in Xanthomonas  bacteria, are naturally occurring or artificially designed proteins that  modulate gene transcription. These proteins recognize and bind DNA sequences  based on a variable numbers of tandem repeats. Each repeat is comprised of a set  of ∼ 34 conserved amino acids; within this conserved domain, there are usually  two amino acids that distinguish one TALE from another. Interestingly, TALEs  have revealed a simple cipher for the one-to-one recognition of proteins for DNA  bases. Synthetic TALEs have been used to successfully target genes in a variety  of species, including humans. Depending on the type of functional domain that is fused to the TALE of interest, these proteins can have diverse biological  effects. For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional  activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA. Targeted genome  editing, in theory, is capable of modifying any endogenous gene sequence of  interest; this can be performed in cells or organisms, and may be applied to, Context:  A growing body of evidence suggests an association between  microdeletion/microduplication and schizophrenia/intellectual disability.

We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events.

In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors, Context: Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins has the ability to  form transmembrane pores large enough to allow cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, as  well as to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP);  however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in some cancers, including bladder cancer.

However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures.

Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug levels,, Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function.

The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis.

The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based  approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural  proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins  orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of  interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

Here we show that the dysregulation of the  pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice,  and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

This paper presents the development of a liquid  chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) screening method for  equine plasma samples to cover over 320 prohibited substances in a single  analytical run. Plasma samples were diluted and processed by solid-phase  extraction. The extracts were then analyzed with LC-HRMS in full-scan positive  electrospray ionization mode. A mass resolution of 60 000 was employed.  Benzyldimethylphenylammonium was used as an internal lock mass. Drug targets were identified by retention time and accurate mass, with a mass tolerance  window of ±3 ppm. Over 320 drug targets could be detected in a 13-min run.  Validation data including sensitivity, specificity, extraction recovery and precision are presented. As the method employs full-scan mass spectrometry, an  unlimited number of drug targets can theoretically be incorporated.

There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib. Inhibitors of KIT, a membrane receptor, are mainly represented by imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase.

Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the  most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation,  and network activity in both mouse and human tumours was characterised by  enrichment for multiple gene-sets indicating increased cell proliferation, IGF  signalling, MYC target upregulation, and decreased neuronal differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data support a model of medulloblastoma  development in SB-mutagenised Ptch+/- mice which involves disruption of a novel  transcription factor network leading to Igf2 upregulation, proliferation of  GNPs, and tumour formation. Moreover, our results identify rational therapeutic targets for SHH subgroup tumours, alongside prognostic biomarkers for the  identification of poor-risk SHH patients, Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo.

What is ceritinib?,"Yes, according to the context, ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC.","Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib, Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs, Context: patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently  overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively  inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a  cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this  increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two  crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these  mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired  resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can  overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several  crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib. These findings  provide the molecular basis for the marked clinical activity of ceritinib in  patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib-resistant disease. Cancer, Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib, Context: of the next-generation ALK TKI, ceritinib (LDK378), in the setting of crizotinib  resistance. An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired  resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of  patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently  overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively  inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a  cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this  increased potency.

CPX-351, a novel liposomal formulation which encapsulates cytarabine and  daunorubicin in 5:1 molar ratio, has shown promising efficacy, leading to recent  US FDA approval for front-line therapy for patients with therapy-related AML and  AML with myelodysplasia-related changes based on a large multicenter Phase III  clinical trial. This review summarizes the clinical development of CPX-351 as  induction therapy, Context: PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation.  METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or, Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrates that CPX-351 improved  quality-adjusted survival, further supporting the clinical benefit in patients  with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

Cilengitide is a selective antagonist of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins,  which are involved in tumor growth and development of metastasis. We have  evaluated the effects of cilengitide on pediatric glioma and neuroblastoma cell  lines for the first time. Expression levels of αvβ3 and αvβ5 were determined by  flow cytometry in three neuroblastoma and five pediatric glioma cell lines  compared with adult U87-MG before and after irradiation. Cell detachment,  cytotoxicity, and cell growth under nonadhesive conditions were measured using  the MTS assay. Cell death and apoptosis were assessed by annexin-V/propidium iodide staining. The varying αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression levels were unrelated to  tumor grade. Irrespective of the αvβ5 expression level, the pediatric cells  expressing αvβ3 were dose dependently sensitive to cilengitide. UW479 cells expressed only αvβ5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting  that cilengitide's action largely depends on αvβ3 inhibition.

Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any ultraconserved elements associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context:  Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK).

Many well characterized  markers of embryonic stem cells including CD9, PODXL and centromere-specific  histone-H3-like protein CENPA are consistently expressed in TGCTs. In embryonic  stem cells, pluripotency and self renewal capacities are provided by a network of OCT3/4, NANOG and SOX2. In testicular germ cell tumors, pluripotency genes  OCT3/4 und NANOG are upregulated both, in seminomas and non-seminomas, while  SOX2 is differentially upregulated in embryonal carcinomas only.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. The context highlights that homologous recombination (HR) is a DNA repair pathway that can cause deleterious genomic rearrangements leading","Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,, Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context:  This work focuses on the main DNA repair pathways, highlighting their role in  gastrointestinal carcinogenesis and the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),  mutations being described in several tumor types, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. The mismatch repair (MMR) system is inherently altered  in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, and plays a role in  carcinogenesis in a subset of sporadic colorectal, gastric and esophageal cancers. Alterations in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous  end-joining (NHEJ) also contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. Gene  polymorphisms of some X-ray cross-complementing (XRCCs), cofactor proteins, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context: Cancer develops when cells no longer follow their normal pattern of controlled  growth. In the absence or disregard of such regulation, resulting from changes  in their genetic makeup, these errant cells acquire a growth advantage,  expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis","20298636, 23678008, 17397816, 12427531, 12488587",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, YAP1 is a mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Yki. This is stated in the first sentence of the context where it says ""A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the ortholog of","Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome. Loss of  endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative,  invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular  apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in, Context: We showed earlier that p300/CBP plays an important role in G1 progression by  negatively regulating c-Myc and thereby preventing premature G1 exit. Here, we  have studied the mechanism by which p300 represses c-Myc and show that in  quiescent cells p300 cooperates with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to repress  transcription. p300 and HDAC3 are recruited to the upstream YY1-binding site of  the c-Myc promoter resulting in chromatin deacetylation and repression of c-Myc  transcription. Consistent with this, ablation of p300, YY1 or HDAC3 expression  results in chromatin acetylation and induction of c-Myc. These three proteins  exist as a complex in vivo and form a multiprotein complex with the YY1-binding site in vitro. The C-terminal region of p300 is both necessary and sufficient  for the repression of c-Myc. These and other results suggest that in quiescent  cells the C-terminal region of p300 provides corepressor function and facilitates the recruitment of p300 and HDAC3 to the YY1-binding site and  represses the c-Myc promoter. This corepressor function of p300 prevents the  inappropriate induction of c-Myc and S phase, Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context:  The Hippo pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell  proliferation and survival in Drosophila, which involves the negative regulation  of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie by the kinases Hippo and Warts. We have recently shown that the human ortholog of Yorkie, YAP, maps to a minimal  amplification locus in mouse and human cancers, and that it mediates dramatic  transforming activity in MCF10A primary mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that LATS proteins (mammalian orthologs of Warts) interact directly with YAP in  mammalian cells and that ectopic expression of LATS1, but not LATS2, effectively  suppresses the YAP phenotypes.

Additionally, ex vivo  studies of human brain slices from an independent sample of patients who had AD  were performed. SETTING: Three university medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients with mild-to-moderate AD. INTERVENTION: Two consecutive cohorts of patients received 2 to 7 infusions of  intravenous gantenerumab (60 or 200 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. Brain slices from patients who had AD were coincubated with gantenerumab at increasing  concentrations and with human microglial cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent change in the ratio of regional carbon 11-labeled, Context: only biologic drug available in clinical practice is omalizumab. To overcome the  limits of omalizumab, the research has focused on new monoclonal antibodies  presenting higher avidity for IgE (e.g. ligelizumab and lumiximab) and ability  to interact also with low affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRII). At present, many new  biological drugs with different mechanisms of action and targets are matter of  research. It is very important to identify the asthmatic phenotype in order to  select the most appropriate drug for the individual patient. The most promising  agents are targeted against cytokines of Th2 pattern and related receptors, such  as IL-2 (daclizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab) or IL-5 in patients with hypereosinophilia (mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab). Other interesting  drugs have as a target TNF-α or its soluble receptor (infliximab, golimumab and  etanercept) or IL-1 (canakinumab), a cytokine with an important systemic proinflammatory action. Finally, the discovery of increased levels of C5a in the  airways of asthmatic patients has led to the synthesis of a specific monoclonal  antibody (eculizumab).

We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled  on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg.

Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor, Context:  In this open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study a fully human anti-CD40  antagonist monoclonal antibody, lucatumumab, was evaluated in patients with  relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools. The subjects were separated into two groups: 159  students were treated with acupuncture on the anti-smoking acupoints of the ear, which is known to be effective for cessation of smoking (case group), and 79  students were treated at other sites of the ear (control group).

Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality  for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females). The treatment group (n = 59) received auricular acupuncture in Shen Men, Sympathetic, Mouth and Lung points for 8 weeks.

The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression).

On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context:  The discovery that bupropion is an effective treatment for tobacco dependence  has triggered a rapid increase in development of potential new non-nicotine  pharmacotherapies, including bromocriptine, glucose, GTS-21, reboxetine, rimonabant, selegeline and varenicline. Successful new products will need to  have excellent side-effect profiles in addition to proven efficacy.

The development of cellular therapy led to the  emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which  include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV).  Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have  successfully been transfected. The ability to control transfected cells and the  capacity to combine and transfect many genes involved in osseous healing will  improve gene therapy, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context: particular B30.2 domain variable elements. These results suggest that  occasional, complex changes were incorporated into the TRIM5alpha B30.2 domain  at discrete time points during the evolution of primates. Some of these time  points correspond to periods during which primates were exposed to retroviral  infections, based on the appearance of particular endogenous retroviruses in  primate genomes. The results are consistent with a role for TRIM5alpha in innate  immunity against retroviruses, Context:  Human APOBEC3 (A3) proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that potently  restrict the replication of retroviruses by hypermutating viral cDNA and/or  inhibiting reverse transcription. There are seven members of this family including A3A, B, C, DE, F, G, and H, all encoded in a tandem array on human  chromosome 22. A3F and A3G are the most potent inhibitors of HIV-1, but only in  the absence of the virus-encoded protein, Vif. HIV-1 utilizes Vif to abrogate A3 functions in the producer cells. More specifically, Vif, serving as a substrate  receptor, facilitates ubiquitination of A3 proteins by forming a Cullin5  (Cul5)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets A3 proteins for rapid","21798570, 21247248, 16717285, 15857996, 22203821","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

RESULTS: We systematically compare lncRNA and protein-coding loci across  vertebrates, and estimate that up to 5% of conserved mammalian lncRNAs are  derived from lost protein-coding genes. These lncRNAs have specific  characteristics, such as broader expression domains, that set them apart from  other lncRNAs. Fourteen lncRNAs have sequence similarity with the loci of the  contemporary homologs of the lost protein-coding genes. We propose that  selection acting on enhancer sequences is mostly responsible for retention of  these regions. As an example of an RNA element from a protein-coding ancestor that was retained in the lncRNA, we describe in detail a short translated ORF in  the JPX lncRNA that was derived from an upstream ORF in a protein-coding gene  and retains some of its functionality.

Some lncRNAs inherited regulatory, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: derived from lost protein-coding genes.

Some lncRNAs inherited regulatory elements influencing transcription and translation from their protein-coding  ancestors and those elements can influence the expression breadth and  functionality of these lncRNAs, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: We have identified 5446 lncRNA genes in the human genome from approximately  24,000 full-length cDNAs, using our new ORF-prediction pipeline. We combined  them nonredundantly with lncRNAs from four published sources to derive 6736  lncRNA genes. In an effort to distinguish standalone and antisense lncRNA genes  from database artifacts, we stratified our catalog of lncRNAs according to the  distance between each lncRNA gene candidate and its nearest known protein-coding  gene. We concurrently examined the protein-coding capacity of known genes  overlapping with lncRNAs. Remarkably, 62% of known genes with ""hypothetical  protein"" names actually lacked protein-coding capacity. This study has greatly expanded the known human lncRNA catalog, increased its accuracy through manual  annotation of cDNA-to-genome alignments, and revealed that a large set of  hypothetical-protein genes in GenBank lacks protein-coding capacity.

May be difficult to diagnose  and may cause significant complications at any stage during gestation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The author presents 2 cases of ovarian endometriomas  diagnosed and treated surgically in 14 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course, Context:  Laparoscopic excision is considered as the 'gold standard' treatment of ovarian  endometrioma. However, a frustrating aspect is that disease can recur. While  laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. It is therefore  crucial to prevent recurrence in order to conserve 'improved' fertility.  Recurrence rates for endometrioma are reported from 11 to 32% within 1-5 years after excision. The recurrence rate is higher in patients with advanced  endometriosis at surgery and in younger patients. Previous medical treatment for  endometriosis prior laparoscopy is a risk factor for recurrence.

METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells.

The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells.

We, Context: disadvantage of traditional IP and co-IP is that the conditions used to elute  the precipitated antigen also release the antibody thus contaminating the  antigen and destroying the antibody support. To overcome these problems, we  describe two methods to generate a reusable antibody support by cross-linking  the antibody to immobilized Protein A or Protein G, or by coupling it directly  to the resin (see Scheme 1). Antibody cross-linking can be done in 1 h while  antibody coupling requires 4 h. IP or co-IP is accomplished by incubating the  antibody resin with the protein sample. Washes and elutions are carried out in a  spin column to reduce resin loss and decrease assay time. Target proteins are eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.8) and the resin-bound antibody is  re-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for reuse. Our studies have  demonstrated that the immobilization efficiency for the antibody coupling method was similar for several species of antibody. Furthermore, we illustrate that  using both methods of antibody immobilization yield IP and co-IP results similar  to traditional protocols but eliminate the antibody heavy and light chain  contamination, Context: pathways must be targeted at the same time.

We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators, Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern.

We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators, Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The  following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World  Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as  neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral  ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and  6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.  RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with  controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was  reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia.  Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with  unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain  injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters.

Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed, Context:  Coronaviruses are pathogens with a serious impact on human and animal health.  They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life  threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in  humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections,  and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This  highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these  viruses and their interactions with the host.

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"Yes, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), a histone methyltransferase expressed in GABAergic and other cortical neurons, has been used to study the transcriptional regulation of G","Context: Alterations in GABAergic mRNA expression play a key role for prefrontal  dysfunction in schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disease. Here, we show  that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation, a chromatin mark associated with the  transcriptional process, progressively increased at GAD1 and other GABAergic  gene promoters (GAD2, NPY, SST) in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) from prenatal  to peripubertal ages and throughout adulthood. Alterations in schizophrenia included decreased GAD1 expression and H3K4-trimethylation, predominantly in  females and in conjunction with a risk haplotype at the 5' end of GAD1.  Heterozygosity for a truncated, lacZ knock-in allele of mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), a histone methyltransferase expressed in GABAergic and other cortical  neurons, resulted in decreased H3K4 methylation at GABAergic gene promoters. In  contrast, Gad1 H3K4 (tri)methylation and Mll1 occupancy was increased in, Context:  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), one of the main inhibitory neurotransmitters in  the brain, interacts with three types of receptors for GABA--GABA(A), GABA(B)  and GABA(C). GABA(A) receptors, associated with binding sites for benzodiazepines and barbiturates in the form of a receptor complex, control  opening of the chloride channel. When GABA binds to the receptor complex, the  channel is opened and chloride anions enter the neuron, which is finally hyperpolarized. GABA(B) receptors are metabotropic, linked to a cascade of  second messengers whilst the physiological meaning of ionotropic GABA(C)  receptors, mainly located in the retina, is generally unknown. Novel, Context: acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we generated  conditional knockout mice with selective deletion of the Tsc1 gene in GABAergic  interneuron progenitor cells. These interneuron-specific Tsc1 conditional  knockout (CKO) mice have impaired growth and decreased survival. Cortical and  hippocampal GABAergic interneurons of CKO mice are enlarged and show increased  mTORC1 signaling. Total numbers of GABAergic cells are reduced in the cortex  with differential reduction of specific GABAergic subtypes. Ectopic clusters of  cells with increased mTORC1 signaling are also seen suggesting impaired  interneuron migration. The functional consequences of these cellular changes are evident in the decreased seizure threshold on exposure to the proconvulsant  flurothyl. These findings support an important role for the Tsc1 gene during  GABAergic interneuron development, function, and possibly migration, Context: Epilepsy is characterised by the propensity of the brain to generate spontaneous  recurrent bursts of excessive neuronal activity, seizures. GABA-mediated  inhibition is critical for restraining neuronal excitation in the brain, and  therefore potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission is commonly used to  prevent seizures. However, data obtained in animal models of epilepsy and from  human epileptic tissue suggest that GABA-mediated signalling contributes to interictal and ictal activity. Prolonged activation of GABA(A) receptors during  epileptiform bursts may even initiate a shift in GABAergic neurotransmission  from inhibitory to excitatory and so have a proconvulsant action. Direct targeting of the membrane mechanisms that reduce spiking in glutamatergic  neurons may better control neuronal excitability in epileptic tissue.  Manipulation of brain pH may be a promising approach and recent advances in gene, Context: transcriptional process, progressively increased at GAD1 and other GABAergic  gene promoters (GAD2, NPY, SST) in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) from prenatal  to peripubertal ages and throughout adulthood.

These effects were not mimicked by haloperidol or genetic ablation of  dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, suggesting that blockade of D2-like signaling is not sufficient for clozapine-induced histone methylation.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, according to the context, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. They are membrane-less organelles that form under conditions of cellular stress and are composed of RNA and proteins involved in mRNA met","Context: domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for  mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response, Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Although the cellular interior is crowded with various biological  macromolecules, the distribution of these macromolecules is highly  inhomogeneous. Eukaryotic cells contain numerous proteinaceous membrane-less  organelles (PMLOs), which are condensed liquid droplets formed as a result of  the reversible and highly controlled liquid-liquid phase transitions. The  interior of these cellular bodies represents an overcrowded milieu, since their  protein concentrations are noticeably higher than those of the crowded cytoplasm  and nucleoplasm. PMLOs are different in size, shape, and composition, and almost  invariantly contain intrinsically disordered proteins (e.g., eIF4B and TDP43 in stress granules, TTP in P-bodies, RDE-12 in nuage, RNG105 in RNA granules,  centrins in centrosomes, NOPP140 in nucleoli, SRSF4 in nuclear speckles, Saf-B  in nuclear stress bodies, NOLC1 in Cajal bodies, CBP in PML nuclear bodies, SOX9 in paraspeckles, KSRP in perinucleolar compartment, and hnRNPG and Sam68 in  Sam68 nuclear body, to name a few), which indicates that the formation of these  phase-separated droplets is crucially dependent on intrinsic disorder.

These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be composed of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and a  10-12 nm microfibrillar component, which is located primarily around the  periphery of the amorphous component. The protein elastin makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties.  Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual  chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids,, Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With, Context: BACKGROUND: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) makes up half  of diagnosed heart failure (HF) cases and has similar outcomes compared to heart  failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but a discrepancy in knowledge  and approach to treatment. HFpEF is diagnosed using the following criteria:  symptoms, preserved ejection fraction (greater than 50%), and evidence of  abnormal left ventricular filling or relaxation, or diastolic distensibility or  stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696 (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF, Context: receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection  Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs.

The infection triggers immune response against infected cells that  leads to the destruction of hepatic cells. This destruction has two  consequences: leaking ALT and AST liver enzymes which increases during the  course of disease and accumulation of bilirubin- a red pigmented compound  released from dead red cells- which causes the yellow coloration of eyes and skin. These viruses transmit through diverse routes i.e. blood transfusion,  sexual contacts and consuming water or food contaminated by feces.

Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) analog, used in  pulmonary hypertension, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory functions.  However, little is known about its role in the MIP-1α production in human  monocytes.  METHODS: We investigated the effects of 3 conventional (iloprost, beraprost, and  treprostinil) and 1 new (ONO-1301) PGI2 analogs, on the expression of MIP-1α  expression in human monocytes. Human primary monocytes from control subjects and  THP-1 cell line were treated with PGI2 analogs, with or without  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Supernatants were harvested to measure  MIP-1α levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To explore which receptors involved the effects of PGI2 analogs on the expression of MIP-1α expression, I  prostanoid (IP) and E prostanoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-r receptor antagonists were used to pretreat THP-1 cells.

In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity, Context: methide of TGZ and N-acetylcysteine. From electrochemical oxidations of  rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and ciglitazone in the presence of GSH, no GSH  conjugates could be identified. These three compounds all contain a  thiazolidinedione moiety. In conclusion, it has been shown that the primary  reactive metabolite of TGZ formed from electrochemical oxidation was the  o-quinone methide, and this metabolite was similar to what was observed to be  the primary reaction product in human and rat liver microsomes, Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation, Context:  Although idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are rare, they are still a major  concern to patient safety. Reactive metabolites are widely accepted as playing a  pivotal role in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. While there are today well established strategies for the risk assessment of stable  metabolites within the pharmaceutical industry, there is still no consensus on  reactive metabolite risk assessment strategies. This is due to the complexity of the mechanisms of these toxicities as well as the difficulty in identifying and  quantifying short-lived reactive intermediates such as reactive metabolites.

Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine.

The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract.

Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, the context does provide information about the organs affected in SLE. The context mentions that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with multiple organ involvement. However","Context:  It is difficult to measure clinical disease activity in systemic lupus  erythematosus because many organs can be involved simultaneously and the  corresponding symptoms are not easy to quantify. Disease activity is poorly defined and there is no consensus on what disease activity means or how it  should be measured. More than 60 systems have been devised but none of them is  commonly used because they do not have the 3 characteristics necessary for such a tool: validity, reliability and sensitivity. Three recent systems, BILAG  (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group), SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Disease Activity Index) and SLAM (Systemic Lupus Activity Measures) are very, Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  Lupus erythematosus (LE) includes a broad spectrum of diseases from a  cutaneous-limited type to a systemic type. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  a systemic autoimmune disease which affects multiple organs. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes skin symptoms seen in SLE and cutaneous-limited LE.  Although immune abnormalities, as well as heritable, hormonal and environmental  factors, are involved in the pathology of LE, the actual pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, the involvement of various cytokines has been shown in the  pathogenesis of LE. Moreover, some trials with biological agents targeted  specific cytokines are also ongoing for SLE. In this article, we review the, Context:  Type I interferons (IFN) are primarily regarded as an inhibitor of viral  replication. However, type I IFN, mainly IFNalpha, plays a major role in  activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multi-systemic, inflammatory autoimmune  disease with undefined etiology. SLE is characterized by dysregulation of both  the innate and the adaptive immune systems. An increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes, termed IFN signature, has been reported in patients with  SLE. We review here the role of IFNalpha in the pathogenesis and course of SLE  and the possible role of IFNalpha inhibition as a novel treatment for lupus  patients, Context: It is difficult to measure clinical disease activity in systemic lupus  erythematosus because many organs can be involved simultaneously and the  corresponding symptoms are not easy to quantify.
