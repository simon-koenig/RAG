What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: is associated with multiple steps during carcinogenesis. Since epigenetic  therapy is now in clinical use in hematopoietic diseases and undergoing trials  for lung cancer, a better understanding of epigenetic abnormalities is desired.  Recent technologies for high-throughput genome-wide analyses for epigenetic  modifications are promising and potent tools for understanding the global  dysregulation of cancer epigenetics. In this chapter, studies of epigenetic  abnormality and its clinical implication in lung cancers are discussed, Context:  Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum.

Describe RIblast,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial cell  cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary for almost all  newly sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for predicting oriCs, however, still  leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of genome  sequences calls for improved software to identify oriCs in newly sequenced and unannotated bacterial genomes. RESULTS: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriCs in  bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base, Context: divergence of life into fungi, plants, and animals. During evolution,  acquisition of a Ca(2+)-binding EF hand domain by an ancestral NOX, led to  NOX5-like isoforms. DUOX isoforms presumably developed from a NOX5-like isoform  through the additional acquisition of a peroxidase homology domain. The  expression pattern of NOX enzymes is specific to each kingdom of life. Fungi  express only ancestral-type isoforms, and plants only NOX5-like isoforms. NOX  expression patterns in animals are complex and ancestral NOXes, NOX5-like  isoforms and DUOXes are generally found. But there are exceptions; for example  rodents lack NOX5 and Caenorhabditis elegans expresses only DUOXes. Biological functions of NOX enzymes include, among others, host defense, post-translational  modification of proteins, and regulation cell growth and differentiation. In  summary, the invention of NOX enzymes early in the development of life was a success story: there is no evidence of multicellular life without NOX enzymes","18237442, 17400358","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942
Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,Visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes involves labeling specific genomic regions with fluorescently tagged short DNA sequences (oligopaints) that are complementary to the target region. This allows researchers to visualize and map the location of specific genes or,"Context:  Visual processing is thought to involve initial local analyses that are  subsequently integrated globally to derive functional representations of  structure that extends over large areas of visual space. Amblyopia is a common deficit in spatial vision that could be based on either unreliable local  estimates of image structure, irregularities in global image integration or a  combination of errors at both these stages. The purpose of this study was to quantify the integration of local spatial information in amblyopia with global  orientation discrimination and inter-ocular matching tasks. Stimuli were  composed of pseudo-random arrays of highly visible and resolvable features, Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome","14680777, 26868282","Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. Coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform, this technology could be extended to any organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. The method gives researchers precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging of chromosomal regions. It is anticipated that this technology will lead to an enhanced ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes.","24510436, 23236188"
Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,The SET7/9 methyltransferase deposits H3K4me1 and H3K4me3.,"Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription. Histone methylation and  demethylation are dynamic processes controlled respectively by histone  methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs). Several HMTs and HDMs have  been implicated in cancer, inflammation, and diabetes, making them attractive  targets for drug therapy. Hence, the discovery of small-molecule modulators for  these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive,, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a","21940714, 21347206",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: is possible to use fetal hemoglobin induction to eliminate the residual α-globin  aggregates and achieve normal levels of hemoglobin. Transgenic K562 cell lines  and erythroid precursor cells from β(0)39-thalassemia patients were employed.  Gene therapy was performed with the lentiviral vector T9W. Induction of fetal  hemoglobin was obtained using mithramycin. Levels of mRNA and hemoglobins were  determined by qRT-PCR and HPLC. First, we analyzed the effect of mithramycin on  K562 transgenic cell lines harboring different copies of a lentiviral vector  carrying the human β-globin gene, showing that γ-globin mRNA expression and HbF  production can be induced in the presence of high levels of β-globin gene expression and HbA accumulation. We then treated erythroid progenitor cells from  β-thalassemic patients with T9W, which expresses the human β-globin gene and  mithramycin separately or in combination. When transduction with our lentiviral vector is insufficient to completely eliminate the unpaired α-globin chains,  combination of β-globin gene transfer therapy together with fetal hemoglobin  induction might be very efficacious to remove the excess of α-globin proteins in, Context: switch in haemoglobin expression, as well as the fetal to adult switch that is  unique to humans and old world monkeys. We discuss the nature of these switches  and models of their regulation. The factors that have been suggested to regulate  this process are then discussed.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,No. The provided context does not mention avelumab as an effective treatment for bladder cancer.,"Context:  Although radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is the standard treatment for  muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), loss of native bladder frequently impairs  patient's quality of life (QOL). Bladder-sparing approach incorporating chemoradiotherapy (CRT) improves QOL while not compromising survival outcomes in  MIBC patients. In this approach, complete response to induction CRT is a  prerequisite for bladder preservation and favorable oncological outcomes.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: GATA factor. AzgA is not closely related to any other characterized membrane  protein, but many close homologues of unknown function are present in fungi,  plants, and prokaryotes but not metazoa. Two of three data bases and the  phylogeny presented in this article places proteins of this family in a cluster  clearly separated (but perhaps phylogenetically related) from the NAT family  that includes other eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleobase transporters.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,The IL-17 receptor.,"Context: pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: maternal branches contained affected individuals, suggesting the possibility of  a bilineal mode of inheritance. While the trait did not obey simple Mendelian  inheritance, the vertical patterns of transmission were consistent with either  an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance or a  multifactorial mode of inheritance. These data provide some preliminary support  to the notion that eveningness, and thus DSPS, may have a genetic component. The  prevalence of symptoms suggestive of DSPS is higher in this family than reported  in the general population. Case reports such as this support the utility of  larger, more systematic studies. It is unclear whether this degree of familiarity is representative of that in the general population, Context:  Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessively inherited syndrome with predisposition to  bone marrow failure and malignancies. Hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents  is a cellular feature used to confirm the diagnosis. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (12 subtypes) as well as X-linked (one subtype). Most  genetic subtypes have initially been defined as ""complementation groups"" by cell  fusion studies.

METHODS: Eighteen healthy women participated in a 2-week intervention trial  involving the daily intake of 500 mL of n-3 PUFA-enriched juice (n = 11) or  plain tomato juice (n = 7). Each serving of enriched juice provided 250 mg of  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Both juices provided  natural antioxidant compounds such as phenolics (181 mg) and lycopene (26.5 mg). RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid  profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL)  remained unchanged. The serum antioxidant status improved following juice intake, as revealed by an increase in total antioxidant capacity and a slight  decrease in lipid peroxidation.

RECENT ADVANCES: A picture is emerging in which a selected group of DUSP enzymes  display overexpression or hyperactivity that is associated with human disease,  especially human cancer, making feasible targeted therapy approaches based on  their inhibition. A panoply of molecular and functional studies on DUSPs have been performed in the previous years, and drug-discovery efforts are ongoing to  develop specific and efficient DUSP enzyme inhibitors. This review summarizes  the current status on inhibitory compounds targeting DUSPs that belong to the MAP kinase phosphatases-, small-sized atypical-, and phosphatases of  regenerating liver subfamilies, whose inhibition could be beneficial for the  prevention or mitigation of human disease, Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,The most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AAUAAA.,"Context: and the involved factors is still largely unknown. RESULTS: We use the ENCODE data to scan DNA functional elements, including  chromatin accessibility and histone modification, around transcript cleavage  sites. Our results demonstrate that polyadenylation sites tend to be less  sensitive to DNase I. However, these polyadenylation sites have preference in  nucleosome-depleted regions, indicating the involvement of chromatin  higher-order structure rather than nucleosomes in the resultant lower chromatin  accessibility. More interestingly, for genes using two polyadenylation sites,  the distal sites show even lower chromatin accessibility compared with the proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site.  We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine 36  tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a  single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the H3K36Me3 levels are comparable  among the alternative polyadenylation sites themselves. In summary,, Context:  Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the  AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end  formation. In agreement with previous results, random sequence insertions between the AAUAAA and G/U box signals were observed to inhibit poly(A) site  function. However, sequence insertions of similar size that were predicted to  form RNA stem-loop structures were found to have little effect on the efficiency of polyadenylation and instead induced a 3' shift in the site of polyadenylation  that was equal to the length of the inserted stem-loop.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that PTEN loss leads to massive alterations of chromosomes, suggesting a role for recombination repair in maintaining genomic stability and its potential involvement in carcinogenesis.","Context: mutations in human cancer. The mechanisms of PTEN functions in tumor suppression  are currently under intense investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that PTEN  plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that  loss of PTEN leads to massive alterations of chromosomes. The tumor suppressor  p53 is known as a guardian of the genome that mediates the cellular response to  environmental stress, leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. Through  completely different mechanisms, PTEN also protects the genome from instability.  Thus, we propose that PTEN is a new guardian of the genome. In this review, we  will discuss new discoveries on the role of PTEN in tumor suppression and explore mechanisms by which PTEN maintains genomic stability, Context:  In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit both genetic and epigenetic  instability.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

Established protocols for experimental  detection and computational inference of CNVs from SNP array and next-generation  sequencing data are available. We present the CNVRanger R/Bioconductor package  which implements a comprehensive toolbox for structured downstream analysis of  CNVs. This includes functionality for summarizing individual CNV calls across a  population, assessing overlap with functional genomic regions, and genome-wide  association analysis with gene expression and quantitative phenotypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://bioconductor.org/packages/CNVRanger, Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,Camels.

Zoonotic diseases are infections that are  transmitted from animals to humans. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely  originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate  host. Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts. Further studies are needed on different wild animal  species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet  markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well. Additional research is needed to  understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals,  modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures  against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"Microdeletion of 16 p13.3 comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein (CREBBP) gene is a rare scenario in the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, but more commonly it's caused","Context: a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of  young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Familial Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th  and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three  females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces. Proband 5 also had a brain tumor (ganglioglioma) at  the age of 3 years. In probands 1-3, direct sequencing identified a novel CREBBP  missense mutation, c.2728A > G (predicting p.Thr910Ala), that was absent in","22269667, 20684013","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. The known genetic causes are a microdeletion at 16p13.3 or mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) at 22q13 (5%). Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.","7630403, 16359492, 22269667, 14974086, 18773673, 20684013, 23432975, 22303793, 15706485, 20689175, 22991675"
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context mentions that unlike Rap1, whose association with RP gene promoters is not affected by environmental changes, Abf1 association dynamically responds to changes in growth conditions, suggesting it might orchestrate transcriptional modulation rather than acting as an insulator","Context: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the large majority of the genes coding for  cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (RPs) depend on the general regulatory factor  Rap1 for their transcription, but a small cohort of them relies on Abf1  regulatory activity. A recent study showed that unlike Rap1, whose association  with RP gene promoters is not affected by environmental changes causing RP gene  repression/reactivation, Abf1 association with both RP gene and ribosome  biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells, Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: related to initial heart failure (both acute and chronic), types III and IV  which include initial kidney failure, and type V which includes several systemic  diseases. Many pathophysiological pathways have been described illustrating how  heart and kidney disease are involved in clinical conditions. The diagnosis of  CRS is based on both blood tests and ultrasound imaging. Several biomarkers  indicating levels of heart and kidney function have emerged over the last few  decades which can be used to predict kidney failure in patients with acute or  chronic heart disease. Kidney injury biomarkers have also to be tested,  especially those indicating glomerular and tubular damage. Renal ultrasound and trans-thoracic echocardiography can provide further information on heart and  kidney failure in patients with cardio-renal syndrome at any stage, Context: Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It  has been shown that inflammatory markers may play a role in the pathogenesis of  heart failure. Therefore, inflammatory markers and anticytokine therapy in heart  failure have become the attractive subjects in the literature. There are new  studies regarding this issue in the literature. In this article, we reviewed  inflammatory markers in heart failure and their prognostic significance based on the literature data","24402629, 16524802",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. Hesperidin treatment was found to be non-significant but when combined with minocycline it potentiated their neuroprotective effect against QA induced HD like symptoms in rats.,"Context: (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per  se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases","24211676, 16964766",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"
Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,Activin type II receptors (ActRII).,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"The mutation identified in the GATA1 gene is a G-to-A mutation at position 759 corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.  Additionally, biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene have been implicated in the Gray Plate","Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but  not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a  spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose, Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized  by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets.
