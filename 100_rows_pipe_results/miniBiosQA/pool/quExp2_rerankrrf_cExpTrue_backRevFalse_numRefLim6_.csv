What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation., Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are lncRNAs that are regulated by SAM68. This is based on","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis.

Initial studies  identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence  of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the  last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and  function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long  non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes.  In this review, we describe the current understanding of long non-coding  RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes: differentiation, development, and  disease., Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks.

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens in the eye becomes subluxated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It can be caused by genetic factors, such as mutations in AD","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context:  If not due to trauma, ectopia lentis is usually caused genetically. It is a main  symptom of several syndromal disorders such as Marfan syndrome or  homocystinuria. Also other connective tissue disorders convey an elevated risk for ectopia lentis. Isolated ectopia lentis is frequently caused by genetic  alterations as well, most commonly due to mutations in ADAMTSL4. Depending on  the molecular basis, the consequences for the management of patients may differ significantly: On the one hand, possible accompanying symptoms may require a  specific surveillance and treatment. Also, the risk for other family members to  develop ectopia lentis or accompanying symptoms can only be determined if the, Context:  PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated  ectopia lentis (EL) family. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were collected from the  family including sixteen patients with isolated EL. Blood samples of nine patients, one normal person and two unknown children's were collected. Genomic  DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood. Genotyping was performed  by microsatellite markers and logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE Programs. Mutation screening in the candidate gene,  fibrillin-1 (FBN1), was performed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Linkage to the FBN1 locus is verified. Mutation screening in FBN1, Context: cardiac or metabolic abnormalities known to be associated with ectopia lentis  were detected. Affected persons shared a 0.67 cM region of homozygosity on  chromosome 1. DNA sequencing revealed a novel mutation in ADAMTSL4,  c.767_786del20. This deletion of 20 base pairs (bp) results in a frameshift and  an introduction of a stop codon 113 bp downstream, predicting a C-terminal  truncation of the ADAMTSL4 protein (p.Gln256ProfsX38). Expression of truncated  ADAMTSL4 mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Three of 190 local blood donors  were carriers of this mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Ectopia lentis et pupillae is associated with a number of malformations primarily in the anterior segment of the eye. The causative  mutation, which is the first to be described in ectopia lentis et pupillae,  disrupts the same gene function previously shown to cause isolated ectopia lentis. The mutation is ancient and may, therefore, be spread to a much larger  population than the investigated one.","24406422, 18079676, 19200529, 25654236, 22539873, 20702823",Ectopia Lentis is dislocation of the optic lens in the eye.,"25939784, 19200529, 25797933"

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique.

Elimination of template function of telomerase RNA may repress the telomerase  activity.  METHODS: A pseudo-knotted HDV ribozyme (g.RZ57) directed against the RNA  component of human telomerase (hTR) was designed and synthesized.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood. In","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform. These results suggest TE sequences are the most direct of PIWI, Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown. This strongly correlates with  enrichment of two histone H3 modifications (dimethylation of lysine 79 and, Context: absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell  proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile.

We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed, but no particular construction is mentioned.","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell., Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced., Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this  goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for  functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can  then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal  genome has not been discovered. This review analyzes the organisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pelagibacter ubique, Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Prochlorococcus  marinus as models of heterotrophic symbiont, heterotrophic free-living,  autotrophic symbiont and autotrophic free-living organisms respectively and compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most  closely resembles a true minimal genome.

Certain of the component parts are well known, but  the overall picture is blurred and often confusing.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 (also known as PR-Set7) deposits H4 Lys 20 methylation. This is stated in the second paragraph of the context, where it mentions that ""PR-","Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By  generating a modification-specific antibody and yeast strains that harbor  mutations in the putative site of methylation, we provide evidence that this  mark exist in vivo. Importantly, we show that this lysine residue is highly  conserved through evolution, and provide evidence that this methylation event  also occurs in higher eukaryotes. By identifying a novel site of histone methylation, this study adds to our overall understanding of the complex number  of histone modifications that contribute to chromatin function., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes., Context: histone variant exchange. Currently, the best-characterized chaperone-histone  interaction is that between the ubiquitous chaperone Asf1 and a dimer of H3 and  H4. Nucleosome assembly proteins (Nap proteins) represent a distinct class of  histone chaperone. Using pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) measurements  and protein crosslinking, we show that two members of this class, Nap1 and  Vps75, bind histones in the tetrameric conformation also observed when they are  sequestered within the nucleosome. Furthermore, H3 and H4 trapped in their  tetrameric state can be used as substrates in nucleosome assembly and  chaperone-mediated lysine acetylation. This alternate mode of histone interaction provides a potential means of maintaining the integrity of the  histone tetramer during cycles of nucleosome reassembly., Context: for any single mutant. Overexpression of Cdc68 in a pol1 mutant strain  dramatically decreased cell viability, consistent with the formation or  modulation of an essential complex by these proteins in vivo. A mutation in  CDC68/SPT16 had previously been shown to cause pleiotropic effects on the  regulation of transcription (J. A. Prendergrast et al., Genetics 124:81-90,  1990; E. A. Malone et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:5710-5717, 1991; A. Rowley et  al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:5718-5726, 1991), with a spectrum of phenotypes similar  to those caused by mutations in the genes encoding histone proteins H2A and H2B  (Malone et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:5710-5717, 1991). We show that at the nonpermissive temperature, cdc68-1 mutants arrest as unbudded cells with a 1C  DNA content, consistent with a possible role for Cdc68 in the prereplicative  stage of the cell cycle. The cdc68-1 mutation caused elevated rates of chromosome fragment loss, a phenotype characteristic of genes whose native  products are required for normal DNA metabolism. However, this mutation did not  affect the rate of loss or recombination for two intact chromosomes, nor did it, Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation.

The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome  4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains  a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is  expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent  missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3  protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic  cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant  genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that  recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series., Context: Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000  live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed  dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an  increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals,  suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals  are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In  contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and  affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents.

It is  transmitted as an autosomally dominant inheritance, and about 80% of affected  individuals result from sporadic mutations without positive family histories.  Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth  factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development. The most common genetic  mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in  the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380. Based on genetic information, molecular genetic testing can provide an exact diagnosis comparing  to radiological and prenatal ultrasound evaluations. Here we introduce  denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for the detection of, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth  factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA from seven sporadic cases of achondroplasia was studied by using PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes. RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene  mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid  and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of  achondroplasia., Context: squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried  out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common  achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor  3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as  molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any  additional genetic alteration.

At the time of birth, HbF accounts for approximately 70% of the total Hb.  The (G)gamma:(A)gamma globin ratio in the HbF of normal newborn is 70:30 whereas  in the trace amounts of HbF that is found in the adult it reverses to 40:60 because of a gamma- to beta-globin gene switch. Alterations of these ratios are  indicative of a molecular defect at the level of the HbF synthesis.

We discuss the nature of these switches  and models of their regulation. The factors that have been suggested to regulate  this process are then discussed. With the increased understanding and discovery  of molecular regulators of haemoglobin switching, such as BCL11A, new avenues of  research may lead ultimately to novel therapeutic, mechanism-based approaches to  fetal haemoglobin reactivation in patients., Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development.

Since, Context: Tpr is a 267-kDa protein forming coiled coil-dominated homodimers that locate at  the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The proteins that  tether Tpr to this location are unknown. Moreover, the question whether Tpr  itself might act as a scaffold onto which other NPC components need to be  assembled has not been answered to date. To assess Tpr's role as an  architectural element of the NPC, we have studied the sequential disassembly and reassembly of NPCs in mitotic cells, paralleled by studies of cells depleted of  Tpr as a result of posttranscriptional tpr gene silencing by RNA interference  (RNAi). NPC assembly and recruitment of several nucleoporins, including Nup50, Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, and Nup153, in anaphase/early telophase is shown to  precede NPC association of Tpr in late telophase.

Analysis of  restriction-enzyme-induced mutations suggests that double-strand break ends are  modified to facilitate rejoining and that the type of modification is  characteristic for different end structures. Double-strand breaks with cohesive  ends appear to have fewer modifications introduced at the break points before rejoining than breaks with blunt ends.

Further  development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of  sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2  positive tumors., Context: imaged breast cancer cases enriched with equivocally scored (2+) cases. Image  features are generated based on the staining profile of the positive control  tissue and pixels delineated by a newly developed Membrane Isolation Algorithm.  Evaluation of results was performed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)  analysis. RESULTS: A computer-aided diagnostic approach has been developed using a  membrane isolation algorithm and quantitative use of positive immunostaining  controls. By incorporating internal positive controls into feature analysis a  greater Area Under the Curve (AUC) in ROC analysis was achieved than feature  analysis without positive controls. Evaluation of HER2 immunostaining that utilized membrane pixels, controls, and percent area stained showed  significantly greater AUC than manual scoring, and significantly less false  positive rate when used to evaluate immunohistochemically equivocal cases. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that by incorporating both a membrane isolation  algorithm and analysis of known positive controls a computer-assisted diagnostic  algorithm was developed that can reproducibly score HER2 status in IHC stained, Context: The product of the HER-2/neu proto-oncogene, HER2, is the second member of the  human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of tyrosine kinase receptors  and has been suggested to be a ligand orphan receptor. Ligand-dependent  heterodimerization between HER2 and another HER family member, HER1, HER3 or  HER4, activates the HER2 signaling pathway. The intracellular signaling pathway  of HER2 is thought to involve ras-MAPK, MAPK-independent S6 kinase and  phospholipase C-gamma signaling pathways. However, the biological consequences  of the activation of these pathways are not yet completely known. Amplification  of the HER2 gene and overexpression of the HER2 protein induces cell transformation and has been demonstrated in 10% to 40% of human breast cancer.  HER2 overexpression has been suggested to associate with tumor aggressiveness,  prognosis and responsiveness to hormonal and cytotoxic agents in breast cancer patients. These findings indicate that HER2 is an appropriate target for  tumor-specific therapies. A number of approaches have been investigated: (1) a  humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2, rhuMAbHER2 (trastuzumab), which is, Context: responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of  HER2-specific antibodies such as Herceptin relates to their ability to direct  HER2 to a Cbl- dependent endocytosis and degradation pathway. The reported  clinical therapeutic efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies in breast  cancer highlights the importance of understanding the biology of HER2.","16800251, 22505536, 11920466, 18534031, 11180765, 11694782",Her-2 belongs to the family of the human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs).,"16707458, 26545934, 15173008, 27993109, 30312728, 15920544, 21896992, 33202212, 11785652, 17536308, 15782071, 11694782, 22505536, 17867585, 12767812, 25620423, 27426127, 30384340, 10480346, 11180765, 19048033, 7612897, 21805036, 19279475, 29389942, 16800251, 18505086"
Which is the protein encoded by the human gene GRIK?,"Yes, the human gene GRIK encodes for a protein. More specifically, it encodes for a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor.","Context:  Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are neurovascular dysplasias that result  in mulberry-shaped lesions predominantly located in brain and spinal tissues.  Mutations in three genes are associated with CCM. These genes encode for the proteins KRIT1/CCM1 (krev interaction trapped 1/cerebral cavernous malformations  1), cerebral cavernous malformations 2, osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3  (CCM2/malcavernin/OSM), and cerebral cavernous malformations 3/programmed cell death 10 (CCM3/PDCD10). There have been many significant recent advances in our  understanding of the structure and function of these proteins, as well as in  their roles in cellular signaling. Here, we provide an update on the current, Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression  pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in  presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of  genetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members  support this hypothesis. The current observation of a microdeletion involving, Context: BACKGROUND: Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is  approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors  overexpress Her2 (erbB2/neu). Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential  component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells,  including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its  amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We determined expression of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in  BT/Her(R) cells selected for resistance to Herceptin. Subsequently, cDNAs, Context: the genes encoding glandular kallikreins in species evolutionarily located  between rodents and man may reveal interesting details on how the gene family  evolved, which in turn could yield information about the function of the  proteins. Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human  tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in  primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys. Genomic Southern, Context:  We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon.

In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context: Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an apoptosis-inducing protein that  participates in cell death during normal development and in various diseases.  Bax resides in an inactive state in the cytosol of many cells. In response to  death stimuli, Bax protein undergoes conformational changes that expose  membrane-targeting domains, resulting in its translocation to mitochondrial  membranes, where Bax inserts and causes release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin  (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes. HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Conversely,  reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and  increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association, Context: apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation.

Conversely,  reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and  increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association  with isolated mitochondria, and suppress cytochrome c release in vitro. Notably,  the mitochondrial genome contains an identical open reading frame, and the  mitochondrial version of HN can also bind and suppress Bax. We speculate therefore that HN arose from mitochondria and transferred to the nuclear genome,  providing a mechanism for protecting these organelles from Bax.","23567243, 23536162, 23536162, 23475110, 12732850, 12732850","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in various types of cancer. This is mentioned in the context for lung cancer, bladder cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.","Context: increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth,  movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context: small interfering RNA or negative control small interfering RNA. The cell  proliferation changes of the transfected bladder urothelial carcinoma cells were  determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis caused by silencing MALAT1 was  evaluated using the flow cytometry assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The motility changes induced by silencing MALAT1 were measured using the wound  healing assay. RESULTS: MALAT1 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma compared with  matched normal urothelium (P=.008). The MALAT1 expression levels were greater in  high-grade carcinomas than in low-grade carcinoma (P=.001). The MALAT1  expression levels were greater in invasive carcinoma than in noninvasive carcinoma (P=.018). Cell proliferation inhibition, increased apoptosis, and  decreased motility were observed in MALAT1 small interfering RNA-transfected  bladder urothelial carcinoma T24 and 5637 cells. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 plays an oncogenic role in urothelial carcinoma of the  bladder. Silencing MALAT1 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for this  cancer., Context: Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors.

SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell  migration. Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug levels,, Context: Genome-wide studies have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)  lacking protein-coding capacity. However, most lncRNAs are expressed at a very  low level, and in most cases there is no genetic evidence to support their in  vivo function. Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1)  is among the most abundant and highly conserved lncRNAs, and it exhibits an  uncommon 3'-end processing mechanism. In addition, its specific nuclear  localization, developmental regulation, and dysregulation in cancer are  suggestive of it having a critical biological function. We have characterized a  Malat1 loss-of-function genetic model that indicates that Malat1 is not essential for mouse pre- and postnatal development. Furthermore, depletion of  Malat1 does not affect global gene expression, splicing factor level and  phosphorylation status, or alternative pre-mRNA splicing. However, among a small number of genes that were dysregulated in adult Malat1 knockout mice, many were  Malat1 neighboring genes, thus indicating a potential cis-regulatory role of  Malat1 gene transcription., Context: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a long  non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and associated  with cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the","22088988, 22722759, 23153939, 22722759, 22840402, 21678027",Malat-1 expression is upregulated in several tumor types,"21266177, 16878148, 24163781, 22722759, 21678027, 16441420, 18006640, 23845456, 20007090, 22858678, 23726266, 15552795, 22088988, 12970751"
Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, the 3D structure of the genome is not stable during cell differentiation. The context mentions that there is substantial remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure during epidermal morphogenesis and that the structural features","Context: organization of the eukaryotic genomes. Chromatin insulators have emerged as one  of the central components of the genome organization tool-kit across species.  Recent advancements in chromatin conformation capture technologies have provided  important insights into the architectural role of insulators in genomic  structuring. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple  spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin  structure during reprogramming and differentiation. In this review, we will  discuss the classical view and our renewed understanding of insulators as global  genome organizers. We will also discuss the plasticity of chromatin structure and its re-organization during pluripotency and differentiation and in  situations of cellular stress., Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis.

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase  chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have  been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These  models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship  between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in  genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of  three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.  Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse  genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin  interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive  structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with, Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology.

Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not directly implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The given context discusses resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH)","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), a syndrome of inherited tissue  hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone, is linked to thyroid hormone receptor (TR)  mutations. A typical feature of GRTH is variable severity of organ involvement among families that, surprisingly, does not correlate with the degree of  T3-binding impairment of the corresponding in vitro synthesized mutant TRs.  Furthermore, variations in the clinical severity among family members harboring identical TR beta mutations have been reported.

PARTICIPANTS:  18 201 ARISTOTLE trial participants. INTERVENTIONS:  In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients were randomised to either 5 mg  apixaban twice daily (n=9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio range 2.0-3.0; n=9081). In the post hoc analysis, patients were divided into  groups according to the number of concomitant drug treatments used at baseline  (0-5, 6-8, ≥9 drugs) with a median follow-up of 1.8 years.

Several novel  oral anticoagulants are being developed as replacements for warfarin for this  indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral  anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a  promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location  in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are  small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the  active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have  been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with  favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical  trials for stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe  in terms of bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have, Context: Results Centre website. The direct thrombin inhibitors, and the factor Xa  inhibitors are the two major new anticoagulant drug classes under development at  present. In phase III trials, dabigatran and rivaroxaban demonstrated at least  as good performance as warfarin at reducing the rate of ischaemic stroke,  systemic embolus, and haemorrhagic ischaemic stroke, whilst maintaining a  comparable or lower rate of major bleeding events.

Studies in animal experimental models  demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia in preterm fetuses but clinical  application to newborn infants are limited to restricted cases, as severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We present a case of therapeutic whole body  cooling in a baby at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with HIE., Context: OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with multiple organ dysfunction  syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality. There is extensive  experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in  infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety  of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a  randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants  who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at  least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress. Three groups (n = 5 per group) were  cooled to core temperatures of 35.5 degrees C (+/-0.5 degrees C), 34.5 degrees  C, and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, for 48 hours before rewarming to 37 degrees, Context: Statistically significant relationships were identified between core temperature  and heart rate (P < .0001), pH (P < .0001), base excess (P = .003), and blood  clot dynamics (longer time to initial clot formation, slower rate of clot  formation, and decrease in clot strength; all P < .001) as assessed by  thromboelastography. No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted  during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no  increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who  were cooled. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC  seems both feasible and safe. Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted.","20470651, 22320395, 22320395, 22320395, 20100756, 20100756",Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in term or late preterm infants.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, telomerase is the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat. This is explicitly stated in the context, as Imetelstat is described as a ""potent and specific telomerase inhibitor"" that binds","Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy., Context:  Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity  for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths., Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site., Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2).

What is the color of the protein Ranasmurfin?,The color of the protein Ranasmurfin is blue. This is explicitly stated in the context as it mentions that the crystals of the purified and crystallized Ranasmurfin protein are an intense blue color.,"Context: Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp lycopersici (Fol) is one of the  main diseases affecting tomatoes. The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress. These results demonstrate the  presence of important mechanisms for defense against Fol in the tomato genotype  BHRS 2,3., Context:  Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing  structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological  sources.

Protein labeling with CyDyes is hampered by protein  precipitation and gel smearing when used above minimal labeling. The solubility  of labeled protein may be improved by introducing water solubilizing groups on  the dye such as cysteic acids. However, addition of a negatively charged functionality will have the undesired effect of shifting the pI in relation to  the unlabeled protein. These limitations have been addressed through the  synthesis of highly water-soluble and pI balancing zwitterionic CyDye fluorophores (Z-CyDyes). The new dyes feature a cysteic acid motif, a titratable  amine functionality and a NHS activated ester group. In side by side 2D-DIGE  comparisons of Z-CyDyes and CyDyes, the new dyes significantly enhanced protein, Context: neighbors within a few hours. The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues. On the  basis of these staining patterns, we found that many olfactory sensory neurons  in the developing mouse olfactory epithelium showed sustained caspase activity","28549197, 20615601, 17077494, 17077494, 23941326, 18483489",Ranasmurfin is a blue protein.,"20615601, 17077494"
List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 has an effect on chromatin by regulating its compaction and affecting gene expression. However, its role in chromatin compaction and gene repression may not be a direct consequence of PRC2 deregulation in","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context:  PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival., Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy, Context: In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia  (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (Ezh2). Tumor cells show little residual H3K27 trimethylation marks compared  with controls. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 Polycomb group protein complex,  which is associated with DNA methyltransferases. Using next-generation  sequencing, we identify alteration in gene expression levels of EZH2 and acquired mutations in PRC2-associated genes (DNMT3A and JARID2) in human adult  T-ALL. Together, these studies document that deregulation of EZH2 and associated  genes leads to the development of mouse, and likely human, T-ALL., Context: The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer  of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Several lines of  evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and  perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed,  the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and  with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene. The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a  candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype. We  report here the genomic structure and fine mapping of the EZH2 gene. We demonstrate that the functional gene actually maps to chromosome 7q35 and that  the sequence previously isolated from a chromosome 21 cosmid corresponds to a  pseudogene. Finally, the nature of the EZH2 protein and its mapping to the, Context: non-PCSCs. The association between EZH2 function and PCSC growth was  investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Cell growth was  investigated by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis of PCSCs were explored by flow  cytometric analysis. Finally, the upstream pathway miRNA level was determined  via a luciferase reporter assay, and the downstream pathway cycle regulators  were examined via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results  showed that LNcap cell line comprised a greater proportion of CD44+/CD133+ cells  by comparison to the PC-3 cell line. EZH2 was up-regulated in PCSCs compared  with non-PCSCs. Silence of EZH2 inhibited cell growth and the cell cycle and promoted the progression of apoptosis. Furthermore, EZH2 was a direct target of  miR-101 in PCSCs and EZH2's mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-101  expression and cyclin E2 (a cell-cycle regulator) was suppressed by siEZH2. In conclusion, EZH2 is essential for PCSC growth, partly through a negative  regulation by miR-101 and positively regulating cyclin E2.","24469045, 18980972, 27903964, 22431509, 10780782, 23739676",Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms,"24077602, 21892963, 22821416, 18980972, 9214638, 25680271, 20631058, 15520282, 19954516, 22966008, 24040281, 23688634, 25617436, 19026781"
What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Yes, according to the context, Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene can cause","Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy). DNA analysis was based on EcoRI/BlnI restriction enzyme digestion  followed by hybridization with P13E-11 molecular probe. In our material, we have, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years.

The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context: = 0.003). No 4q haplotype was exclusively associated with the presence of  disease. In 13% of families in which D4Z4 alleles with 4-8 repeats segregate,  the diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy was reported only in one  generation. In conclusion, this large-scale analysis provides further  information that should be taken into account when counselling families in which  a reduced allele with 4-8 D4Z4 repeats segregates. In addition, the reduced  expression of disease observed in distant relatives suggests that a family's  genetic background plays a role in the occurrence of facioscapulohumeral  muscular dystrophy. These results indicate that the identification of new susceptibility factors for this disease will require an accurate classification  of families., Context:  Autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) has an unusual  pathogenic mechanism. FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4  macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat,  DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in  somatic tissues. In FSHD, the combination of inefficient chromatin silencing of the D4Z4 repeat and polymorphisms on the FSHD-permissive alleles that stabilize  the DUX4 mRNAs emanating from the repeat result in inappropriate DUX4 protein  expression in muscle cells. FSHD is thereby the first example of a human disease","23969240, 22551571, 15307599, 22551571, 24030947, 21288772",Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.,"10864616, 10487912, 21795275, 15307599, 10969520, 23143600, 7739631, 22551571, 19248726, 22525183"

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study with rats, tomato juice consumption led to significantly lower total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels compared to the control group. The reduction in cholesterol was attributed to lycopene","Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, the indication for isradipine can be inferred as the treatment of hypertension. This is evident from the context where isradipine is used as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs to normalize diastolic","Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion  of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension,  resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and  augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass., Context: One-year open Multicentric Isradipine Study (MIS) performed in 7 centres in  Czechoslovakia included 144 patients with mild and moderate hypertension.  Isradipine was given at a dose of 2.5 mg daily. If normalization of diastolic  blood pressure (BP) had not been reached, the dosage was increased to 5 mg.  Monotherapy with isradipine normalized diastolic BP in 44% of patients.  Isradipine (5 mg daily) was combined with bopindolol in patients in whom  isradipine alone failed to normalize diastolic BP. These had higher mean  systolic and diastolic BP, body weight, erythrocyte and platelet counts at the  beginning of the study. The combination of isradipine with bopindolol normalized diastolic BP in 87% of the group at the end of 48 weeks' treatment. Tolerance  was excellent in 82% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 8% patients,  undesirable effects being the reason in 2%, ineffective therapy in 2% and poor adherence to therapy in 4%.

In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner.","9544865, 15257873, 2150641, 2137344, 1363224, 7738211",Isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients,"2137344, 11172743, 14727944, 15257873, 8963604, 12215829, 1363224, 10854683, 7848351, 9544865, 8466736, 7918132, 7955262, 10728516, 7946181, 7621840, 2949585, 8213473, 7738211, 7789292, 8205296, 2150641, 2523644, 7921533, 2523646"
Which genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development?,"Yes, several genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development. These include RASSF1A, which is often inactivated through biallelic hypermethylation, and IGF2, which has been","Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context: subgroup of tumours. Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the  most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation,  and network activity in both mouse and human tumours was characterised by  enrichment for multiple gene-sets indicating increased cell proliferation, IGF  signalling, MYC target upregulation, and decreased neuronal differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data support a model of medulloblastoma  development in SB-mutagenised Ptch+/- mice which involves disruption of a novel  transcription factor network leading to Igf2 upregulation, proliferation of  GNPs, and tumour formation. Moreover, our results identify rational therapeutic targets for SHH subgroup tumours, alongside prognostic biomarkers for the  identification of poor-risk SHH patients., Context: medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation.  PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the two-color multiplexing technique. RESULTS: We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were  associated with significantly decreased patient survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). Significant differences between gender were found,  with a higher expression level of the PCGF2 gene observed among females  (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations., Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro., Context: genetic mechanisms play a role in the activation of PDGFR-RAS/MAPK signalling in  medulloblastoma, we performed a direct sequence analysis of the established  mutational ""hotspots"" of known targets of activating mutations within the  pathway (PDGFRA, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS and BRAF) and PDFRFB, in a cohort of 28  primary tumours. A synonymous sequence variation in PDGFRA (CCG to CCA; PRO 567  PRO) was detected in two cases (approximately 7%), but not in 150 normal  chromosomes assessed, suggesting that the PDGFRA locus may be associated with  medulloblastoma development in certain cases. No evidence for oncogenic  mutations affecting NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or PDFRFB was found in any case. These data demonstrate that activating mutations in established mutational  hotspots within the PDGFR-RAS/MAPK pathway are rare events in medulloblastoma  development, and suggest that alternative mechanisms are responsible for RAS/MAPK pathway activation in this disease.","12384556, 24252690, 20717685, 19747111, 19270706, 16434186","Medulloblastomas are the most frequent malignant brain tumors affecting children.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines.

Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the, Context: protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their  anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR  sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and  its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an  inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or  calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory  effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated  with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with  both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake,  storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA  interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival, Context: multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle  specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts  directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic  regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating  formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and  independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and  phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex  dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance  in the β-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein  20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L)  result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers. These findings provide insights  into the mechanisms underlying fine-tuned regulation of protein phosphatase-1  and its impact on the SERCA2/phospholamban interactome in cardiac function.","26799670, 29199006, 28039265, 16772299, 25451386, 24244723",LB-100 is a phosphatase 2A inhibitor,29199006
What is ceritinib?,"Ceritinib is an oral inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a gene that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of selected tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NS","Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase, Context: Ceritinib is a highly selective inhibitor of an important cancer target,  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Because it is an investigational compound,  there is a need to develop a robust and reliable analytical method for its  quantitative determination in human plasma. Here, we report the validation of a  liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid  quantification of ceritinib in human plasma. The method consists of protein precipitation with acetonitrile, and salting-out assisted liquid-liquid  extraction (SALLE) using a saturated solution of sodium chloride prior to  analysis by LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) technique in positive mode. Samples were eluted at 0.800 mL min(-1) on Ascentis Express® C18 column  (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) with a mobile phase made of 0.1 % formic acid in water  (A) and 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The method run time was 3.6 min, Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regulatory submissions have also been made in the EU and other countries.

Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, there exists a deep learning system that outperforms some dermatologists in detecting melanoma. This system is based on Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture and was trained using dermoscopic images and corresponding","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.

Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02).

Thus, manipulation of microRNA-transcription factor  gene networks may be provides a novel approach for developing cancer therapies., Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

To  date, no reliable biomarkers for the detection and risk stratification of  gliomas have been identified. Recently, we demonstrated significant levels of  microRNAs (miRNAs) to be present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from  patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Because of the involvement of miRNA in  carcinogenesis, miRNAs in CSF may serve as unique biomarkers for minimally  invasive diagnosis of glioma. The objective of this pilot study was to identify  differentially expressed microRNAs in CSF samples from patients with glioma as  potential novel glioma biomarkers. With use of a candidate approach of miRNA quantification by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),  miRNAs with significant levels in CSF samples from patients with gliomas were  identified.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Yes, the VAC regimen for Ewing's sarcoma includes vincristine (V), actinomycin D (A), and cyclophosphamide (C). This is explicitly stated in the context.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context: The results achieved in 157 patients with non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma of the  bone treated at a single institution between 1991 and 1997 according to a new  protocol (REN-3) are reported. Induction chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of  'VAC': vincristine (V), doxorubicin (A), cyclophosphamide (C) alternated with  one cycle of 'VIAc': V, ifosfamide (I), actinomycin (Ac). After local treatment,  patients received three more cycles of VAC, two of VIAc, three cycles of I plus  etoposide (E) and two cycles with V, C and Ac. Local treatment was surgery in  53% of patients, surgery+radiotherapy in 25% and radiotherapy only in 22%. With  a follow-up ranging between 4 and 10 years (mean: 7 years), 110 patients (70%) remained continuously event-free, 2 patients died of toxicity and 45 patients  relapsed: 33 due to metastases and 12 due to local recurrence always associated  with metastases. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 71.0 and 76.5% respectively. These results are significantly better that  the ones achieved in our previous three studies in which a three-drug VAC  regimen (REA-1), and 4-drug VACAc regimen (REA-2 and REN-1) was used, and in our, Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients., Context: at the base of the bladder. No additional abnormal findings were disclosed by  other diagnostic imaging methods. The surgical specimens showed small round cell  tumor with positive staining for MIC2 gene product (CD99). EWS-FLI1 fusion  transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and  direct sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of PNET/ES. The patient developed  swollen pelvic lymph nodes as well as multiple lung metastases at 8 months  postoperatively. No effective results could be obtained even with systemic  chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide  (VIDE) based on the EUROpean Ewing tumour Working Initiative of National Groups 1999 (EURO-E.W.I.N.G. 99) multinational trial. The patient died of acute  superior mesenteric artery thrombosis at 22 months postoperatively.

Further  enrollment was therefore discontinued. No significant or unexpected toxicities  were observed with olaparib, with only a single case each of grade 3 anemia and  grade 3 thrombocytopenia observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a prospective phase II trial to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced  Ewing sarcoma after failure of standard chemotherapy. Olaparib administration  was safe and well tolerated when administered to this small heavily pre-treated  cohort at the 400 mg BID dose, although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 weeks. No significant responses or durable disease control was seen,  and the short average interval to disease progression underscores the  aggressiveness of this disease.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"Yes, there are multiple prominent sequence consensuses for the polyadenylation site. The most well-known one is AAUAAA, but in the context provided, two other consensus sequences are also mentioned. One is (C/T","Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation., Context: present in the 2092 nucleotide interval.

Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors., Context: present in the 2092 nucleotide interval.

A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome., Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker because it binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells. This property can be used to detect apoptotic cells in various ass","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the  immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology. The application of Annexin V, Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process., Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF  expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells., Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: RNA samples were obtained from HER2-positive (SKBR3 and  BT474) and HER2-negetive (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) cells with and without  trastuzumab treatment for 6 days. Next, we conducted a microRNA profiling  analysis using these samples to screen those microRNAs that were up- or  down-regulated only in HER2-positive cells. This analysis identified miR-26a and  miR-30b as trastuzumab-inducible microRNAs. Transfecting miR-26a and miR-30b  induced cell growth suppression in the BC cells by 40% and 32%, respectively. A  cell cycle analysis showed that these microRNAs induced G1 arrest in  HER2-positive BC cells as trastuzumab did. An Annexin-V assay revealed that miR-26a but not miR-30b induced apoptosis in HER2-positive BC cells. Using the  prediction algorithms for microRNA targets, we identified cyclin E2 (CCNE2) as a  target gene of miR-30b. A luciferase-based reporter assay demonstrated that miR-30b post-transcriptionally reduced 27% (p = 0.005) of the gene expression by  interacting with two binding sites in the 3'-UTR of CCNE2.

Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"Yes, Aire and Deaf1 are ultraconserved elements associated with ESC self-renewal. They are transcription factors that play global transcriptional regulatory functions and help maintain ESCs in a transcriptionally hyper","Context: overexpressed. Further studies revealed that T cell factor 3 ( TCF3) is a  potential downstream target of TERRA and mediates the effect of TERRA in mESC  maintenance. TERRA inhibits TCF3 transcription, while enforced TCF3 expression  abrogates the undifferentiated state of mESCs supported by TERRA. Accordingly,  the transcripts of the pluripotency genes Esrrb, Tfcp2l1, and Klf2, repressed by  TCF3 in mESCs, are increased in TERRA-overexpressing cells. Our study therefore  highlights the important role of TERRA in mESC maintenance and also uncovers a  mechanism by which TERRA promotes self-renewal. These data will expand our  understanding of the pluripotent regulatory network of ESCs., Context: Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern  similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse  ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as  attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In  addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed  in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown. These results suggest  that transcription factors such as Aire and Deaf1, which exert global  transcriptional regulatory functions, may play important roles in self-renewal  of ESCs and maintaining ESC in a transcriptionally hyperactive state., Context: For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid  differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related transcription factors Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Esrrb and Klf4. Upon ESC  differentiation, most of these binding sites disappear and instead new CTCF  independent RAD21 binding sites emerge, which are enriched for binding sites of, Context: Previously known to function in the thymus stromal cells and peripheral lymphoid  organs respectively, Aire and Deaf1 help regulate the ectopic expression of  diverse tissue-specific antigens to establish self-immune tolerance.  Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern  similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse  ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as  attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In  addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed  in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown.

FINDINGS: The efficacy and safety of linagliptin and empagliflozin as  monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs has been  established through extensive clinical trial programs. Studies specifically  evaluating the efficacy/safety of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor/sodium  glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in combination are limited, but do include  two studies of linagliptin/empagliflozin of up to 52 weeks in duration. These  studies show that the single-pill combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin produced clinical improvements in glycemic control that were generally superior  to the improvements seen with linagliptin and empagliflozin alone, but with a  safety profile comparable to that of the individual constituents.

This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542., Context: RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial  neoplasm (n = 352). Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02× increased  odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031,  CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic  curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day  readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts  a 0.98× reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99,  C-statistic = 0.70). But LACE+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P =  0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218).

The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. Inherited mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways can lead to gene rearrangements and may be a","Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: possible to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse manifestation of DNA damage  resulting from defects in any of the large variety of DNA double-strand break  (DSB) repair mechanisms. Breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases,  has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway,  which in turn switches damage removal towards alternative, more error-prone DSB  repair pathways such as microhomology-mediated non-homologous end joining  (mmNHEJ). Indeed, increased error-prone DSB repair activities were detected in  peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with familial breast cancer risk  independently of specific gene mutations. Intriguingly, sequence analysis of breakpoint regions revealed that the majority of genome aberrations found in  breast cancer specimens are formed by mmNHEJ. Detection of pathway-specific  error-prone DSB repair activities by functional testing was proposed to serve as biomarker for hereditary breast cancer risk and responsiveness to therapies  targeting HR dysfunction. Identification of specific error-prone DSB repair  mechanisms underlying CNAs and ultimately mammary tumour formation highlights, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context:  DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair. This review presents the  main mechanisms and pathways of homologous recombination repair, Context: to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of  dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have  tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce  apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved  complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these  lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an  overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of  DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited  or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to  radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair  and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer., Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis.","23675572, 23541693, 12427531, 22276468, 12016139, 12488587",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, YAP/TAZ are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki. This is stated in the second context where it's mentioned that mutations in genes acting at multiple steps of the endolysos","Context: position of the DAZ and CDY genes is seen only in the chimpanzee. We hypothesize  that this is best explained by sperm competition that results in the variant DAZ  and CDY haplotypes detected in this species. In contrast, bonobos, gorillas and  orangutans-species that are not subject to sperm competition-showed no  intraspecific variation in DAZ and CDY suggesting that monoandry in gorillas,  and preferential female mate choice in bonobos and orangutans, probably  permitted the fixation of a single Y variant in each taxon. These data support  the notion that the evolutionary history of a primate Y chromosome is not simply  encrypted in its DNA sequences, but is also shaped by the social and behavioral circumstances under which the specific species has evolved., Context: neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in  the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis., Context: the Sry2 locus) has an increased cytoplasmic fraction due to alterations at  amino acid 21. Sry-γ has altered gene regulation of the Sry1 promoter due to  changes at amino acid 76.  CONCLUSIONS: The duplication of Sry on the Rattus norvegicus Y-chromosome has  led to proteins with altered functional ability that may have been selected for  functions in addition to testis determination. Additionally, several other genes  not normally found on the Y-chromosome have duplicated new copies into the  region around the Sry genes. These suggest a role of active transposable  elements in the evolution of the mammalian Y-chromosome in species such as  Rattus norvegicus., Context: (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on  the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the  physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also  induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We  also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or  proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.  Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication  cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: Virus-induced cell death is a determinant of pathogenesis. Mammalian reovirus is a versatile experimental model for identifying viral and host  intermediaries that contribute to cell death and for examining how these factors  influence viral disease. In this study, we identified that in addition to apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death, reovirus is capable of inducing an  alternate form of controlled cell death known as necroptosis. Death by this  pathway perturbs the integrity of host membranes and likely triggers, Context: METHODS: We employed Bayesian Inference (BI) methods for the phylogenetic  reconstructions and divergence dating among lineages, using unique haplotype  sequences from two mitochondrial loci (COXI, 16S) and one nuclear locus (28S).

What is the drug  gantenerumab targeting?,"Yes, gantenerumab targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. It is an investigational fully human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and remove beta-amy","Context: million people around the world. It is expected that the illness will affect  about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current  Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable  of slowing down disease progression. Indeed, all currently available therapies,  such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), are  primarily considered symptomatic therapies, although recent data also suggest  possible disease-modifying effects. Gantenerumab is an investigational fully  human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and  remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. This compound, currently undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials represents a promising agent with a  disease-modifying potential in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview  of gantenerumab ranging from preclinical studies to human clinical trials., Context: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic  and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease  process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target  β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological  hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging  anti-Aβ drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs  in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the  β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of  cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in, Context: The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors marked an important advancement in  the development of cancer therapeutics. Pembrolizumab is a selective humanized  IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits the programmed death-1 (PD-1)  receptor, an integral component of immune checkpoint regulation in the tumor  microenvironment. The drug is currently approved by the Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma and metastatic squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several published studies  demonstrate that single-agent pembrolizumab is safe and has efficacy in patients  with NSCLC. Many ongoing protocols are investigating the role of pembrolizumab in combination with other agents in lung cancer and various other cancer types.  We review the available data on pembrolizumab in NSCLC and examine the role of  potential predictive biomarkers of response to therapy., Context: Since the innovation of epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analog, providing treatment  for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the 1990s, two types of oral drugs,  endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, have  further improved therapy for PAH. In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH., Context: Advanced thyroid carcinoma is an infrequent tumor entity with limited treatment  possibilities until recently. The extraordinary improvement in the comprehension  of genetic and molecular alterations involving the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated  protein kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of  rapamycin signaling and interacting pathways that are involved in tumor  survival, proliferation, differentiation, motility and angiogenesis have been  the rationale for the development of new effective targeted therapies. Data  coming from phase II clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of those  targeted agents against receptors in cell membrane and cytoplasmic molecules. Moreover, four of those investigational drugs, vandetanib, cabozantinib,  sorafenib and lenvatinib, have reached a phase III clinical trial with favorable  results in progression-free survival and overall survival in medullary thyroid carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Further analysis for an optimal  approach has been conducted according to mutational profile and tumor subtypes.  However, consistent results are still awaited and the research for adequate, Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the  calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic  and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand  (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). We  provide an update on published Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, safety/tolerability  data, pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action of these biologicals. RECENT FINDINGS: The efficacy data from Phase 2 trials are corroborated by those  from published Phase 3 trials, with a multitude of publications expected in  2018.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Yes, there are proteins with HEAT repeats mentioned in the context. Specifically, Symplekin is a protein that contains a HEAT domain, which is a region composed of multiple tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. Additionally,","Context: the use of adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the standard treatment for these  tumors, although several studies have documented that the current standard  combination chemotherapy is suboptimal. Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities. We present a  model in which an alpha-independent beta-Kap progenitor gave rise to the  alpha-dependent beta-Kaps and the alpha-Kaps., Context: the merozoite, present either in the apical region (A-type) or in the cytosol  (B-type). The presence of RIFINs in merozoites suggests that antigenic variation  in P. falciparum is not only restricted to parasite-derived proteins at the IE  surface, but the phenomenon also prevails in other life cycle stages.  Interestingly, some RIFIN variants were detected only in intracellular stages  and not in merozoites, pointing to differential developmental expression  patterns for distinct members of this large protein family., Context: making clear the importance of those studies for the proteomics community and  the journal audience. This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution  based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of  protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different  algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated  using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying  complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and  combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total  >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported  proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported  proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of  search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The  results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF.

Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation  site is conserved through most metazoan phlya.

Does lucatumumab bind to CD140?,"No, lucatumumab does not bind to CD1","Context: mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and  lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean  duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial  response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at  all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0  mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50  h following the first infusion, and 124 h following the fourth infusion. In  summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that  supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity. Future efforts with  lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy., Context:  In this open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study a fully human anti-CD40  antagonist monoclonal antibody, lucatumumab, was evaluated in patients with  relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicities  (DLTs). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and antimyeloma activity. Twenty-eight patients, enrolled using a standard '3 + 3' dose escalation, received one or two (n = 3) cycles of lucatumumab 1·0,  3·0, 4·5 or 6·0 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks.

Severe, Context: Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of  CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC). We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled  on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and  lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean  duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days.

Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor, Context: adverse events were anaemia, chills, hypercalcaemia and pyrexia (7% each). DLTs  included grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase  and grade 4 increased lipase (n = 1 each). The MTD was 4·5 mg/kg. At doses  ≥3·0 mg/kg, sustained receptor occupancy (≥87%), observed throughout weekly  infusions up to 5 weeks after the last infusion, correlated with an estimated  half-life of 4-19 d. Twelve patients (43%) had stable disease, and one patient  (4%) maintained a partial response for ≥8 months. These findings indicate that  single-agent lucatumumab was well tolerated up to 4·5 mg/kg with modest clinical  activity in relapsed/refractory MM, warranting further study as a combination  therapy., Context: understanding of these mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies.  Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that  modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted  to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS),  representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor  microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of  these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and  CD8+ T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency  than their matched CD161-negative counterparts. Interestingly, CD161+ CD4+ T  cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor, less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative  phenotype.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about three indications for bupropion.  1. As an antidepressant: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine neuro","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: BACKGROUND: Bupropion has been available in the United States since 1989.  Initially a thrice-daily immediate-release formulation, a twice-daily  sustained-release formulation followed in 1996, and, in August 2003, a  once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression). CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion is an effective and well tolerated smoking cessation  intervention. Further studies with long term follow-up will be useful in, Context: rates at 12 months in 2 studies were 23.1 and 30.3% with bupropion, whereas  values for placebo were 12.4 and 15.6%. Continuous abstinence rates at 12  months, available from 1 trial, were 18.4% with bupropion and 5.6% with placebo.  Furthermore, bupropion was associated with significantly higher quitting rates  than nicotine patch in a comparative study. Combination therapy with bupropion  and nicotine patch provided slightly higher abstinence rates than bupropion  alone, although differences were not statistically significant. The combination  was superior to nicotine patch alone. Data from a preliminary report of long  term bupropion treatment (52 weeks) showed that the drug was associated with significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.

RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).

Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy.

A functional polymorphism in the human MAOA gene (high-  and low-MAOA) has been associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. To investigate directly the biological mechanism whereby this polymorphism  influences brain function, we recently measured the activity of the MAO A enzyme  in healthy volunteers. When found no relationship between the individual's brain MAO A level and the MAOA genotype, we postulated that there are additional  regulatory mechanisms that control the MAOA expression. Given that DNA  methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that, Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including  dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.

These results suggest that exon skipping may  be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in  spinocerebellar ataxia type 3., Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and  Machado-Joseph disease or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) are three  distinctive forms of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) caused by  expansions of an unstable CAG repeat localized in the coding region of the  causative genes. Another related disease, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy  (DRPLA) is also caused by an unstable triplet repeat and can present as SCA in late onset patients. We investigated the frequency of the SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3  and DRPLA mutations in 328 Brazilian patients with SCA, belonging to 90  unrelated families with various patterns of inheritance and originating in different geographic regions of Brazil. We found mutations in 35 families (39%),  32 of them with a clear autosomal dominant inheritance.

The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the  loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the  cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of SCA3-associated  peripheral neuropathy, we performed nerve conduction studies and  histopathological analyses. Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 18 SCA3, Context:  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known by the eponym Machado-Joseph  disease, is an autosomal dominant CAG trinucleotide (polyglutamine) repeat  disease that presents in young- to middle-aged adults. SCA3 was first described in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. They have the ability to integrate genetic information into chromosomes, making them useful for functional genomics, gene transfer, and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences and potential","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase  cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the mouse  enzyme was found to be transferred to human cells at high efficiency. Enzyme, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the","21247248, 16717285, 14683449, 24158830, 10757351, 7624311","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The authors suggest  that an abrupt drop in dopamine may occur when milk release is triggered,  resulting in a real or relative brief dopamine deficit for affected women. Clinicians can support women with D-MER in several ways; often, simply knowing  that it is a recognized phenomenon makes the condition tolerable. Further study  is needed.","29115857, 20443435, 21645333, 29115857, 20443435, 21645333","Dysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria, or undesirable feeling that occurs with the MER and continues for no more than a few minutes.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, most tumour-specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein-coding genes. However, they usually arise due to point mutations in these genes, which can result in altered protein products that may be recognized as foreign by the","Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour.

BG-A, B, and H type 2 compatible with the  ABO status in tumor cells were expressed in 60% of the cases. Accumulation of H  type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of  patients with BG status other than 0. Tumor-associated antigens, Lex and sialylated Lex were detected in 36.0% and 72.0%, respectively. Modification of  carbohydrate antigens in cancer may be associated with incomplete synthesis;  accumulation of precursor antigen; and activated sialylation., Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion.

Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in  7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex  Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with  phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four  other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of  six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31.

METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic  diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 34) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome are brachycephaly (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad,  depressed nasal bridge (65 percent), a high forehead (56 percent), ptosis (53 percent), and prominent auricular crura (56 percent). Furthermore, using  different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were  identified in 71 percent of patients., Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome  7p21.2. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a  new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears  to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as  a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome. As a consequence we advise to routinely perform mutation analysis of the FGFR1, 2, and 3 genes in children with  non-syndromic trigonocephaly., Context: additional malformations and without chromosome breakage, who fits this narrow  definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation  in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the  protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk  for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance.  Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation,  while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is  very low., Context:  BACKGROUND: Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous  phenotype. The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the  authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008).

We recently demonstrated that halofuginone (HF), a widely studied  derivative of febrifugine, inhibits the development of T(H)17-driven  autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by activating the amino acid  response (AAR) pathway. Here we show that HF binds glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA  synthetase (EPRS), inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity; this inhibition  is reversed by the addition of exogenous proline or EPRS.

Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,"No, according to a retrospective study, laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. The study found no significant differences in response to gonad","Context:  Laparoscopic excision is considered as the 'gold standard' treatment of ovarian  endometrioma. However, a frustrating aspect is that disease can recur. While  laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. It is therefore  crucial to prevent recurrence in order to conserve 'improved' fertility.  Recurrence rates for endometrioma are reported from 11 to 32% within 1-5 years after excision. The recurrence rate is higher in patients with advanced  endometriosis at surgery and in younger patients. Previous medical treatment for  endometriosis prior laparoscopy is a risk factor for recurrence. Pregnancy soon, Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs.  PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical, Context: natural pregnancy rate in the control group. Pregnancy rates in patients  receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15)  before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively. In post-menopausal women, the  median (quartile) age at menopause was similar in the study (n=9) and control  groups (n=6) [48 (45-52) versus 49 (44-52) years, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced  long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no  contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve  the success rates of fertility treatment., Context:  OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"No, Evolocumab does not target an enzyme. Instead, it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies  inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it  for degradation. Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show  that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly  limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus  formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and  adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not, Context: A model to quantitatively characterize the effect of evinacumab, an  investigational monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3  (ANGPTL3) on lipid trafficking is needed. A quantitative systems pharmacology  (QSP) approach was developed to predict the transient responses of different  triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles in response to evinacumab  administration. A previously published hepatic lipid model was modified to  address specific queries relevant to the mechanism of evinacumab and its effect  on lipid metabolism. Modifications included the addition of intermediate-density  lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein compartments to address the modulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by evinacumab, ANGPTL3 biosynthesis and  clearance, and a target-mediated drug disposition model. A sensitivity analysis  guided the creation of virtual patients (VPs).

These predictions are obtained by the  detection of similarity for pairs of 'component' proteins to 'composite'  proteins. Since the amount of composite proteins is limited in nature, we  augment this set by creating artificial fusion proteins from experimentally  determined protein interacting pairs. The goal is to study the extent of protein  interaction partners with increasing phylogenetic distance, using an automated  method. We have thus detected component pairs within seven entire genome sequences of similar size, using artificially generated composite proteins that  have been shown to interact experimentally. Our results indicate that protein  interactions are not conserved over large phylogenetic distances. In addition, we provide a set of predictions for functionally associated proteins across  seven species using experimental information and demonstrate the applicability  of fusion analysis for the comparative genomics of protein interactions., Context:  The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID:  https://thebiogrid.org) is an open access database dedicated to the annotation  and archival of protein, genetic and chemical interactions for all major model organism species and humans.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein  (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief  that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk,  stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly  characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets  only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP  granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and  adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for  cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct  responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific  RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified.

Monoubiquitylated FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with proteins involved in  DNA repair, including BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and RAD51. All these  factors are required for cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. The  inactivation of the FA pathway has also been observed in a wide variety of human  cancers and is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA crosslinking  agents. Drugs that inhibit the FA pathway may be useful chemosensitizers in the  treatment of cancer. Publication history: Republished from Current BioData's  Targeted Proteins database (TPdb; http://www.targetedproteinsdb.com)., Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding  that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for  cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with ICH within 8 hours of onset. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation,  thrombolysis, trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for, Context:  PURPOSE: Haematoma expansion is a devastating complication of intracerebral  haemorrhage (ICH) with no established treatment. Tranexamic acid had been an  effective haemostatic agent in reducing post-operative and traumatic bleeding. We review current evidence examining the efficacy of tranexamic acid in  improving clinical outcome after ICH. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical trial registers for studies using search strategies incorporating the terms 'intracerebral  haemorrhage', 'tranexamic acid' and 'antifibrinolytic'. Authors of ongoing  clinical trials were contacted for further details., Context:  INTRODUCTION: Seizures are common after intracerebral haemorrhage. Tranexamic  acid increases the risk of seizures in non-intracerebral haemorrhage population  but its effect on post-intracerebral haemorrhage seizures is unknown. We explored the risk factors and outcomes of seizures after intracerebral  haemorrhage and if tranexamic acid increased the risk of seizures in the  Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seizures were reported prospectively up to day 90. Cox  regression analyses were used to determine the predictors of seizures within  90 days and early seizures (≤7 days). We explored the effect of early seizures  on day 90 outcomes.","32637645, 31008298, 32637645, 31322116, 31008298, 32637645",No. According to clinical trial data tranexamic acid does not improve outcomes of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.,"31322116, 31008298, 32637645, 33128912, 29778325"
Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, the lectin complement pathway (LCP) is activated by ficolin-3. Ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the LCP and forms complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1","Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern.

Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has  been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of  Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common  pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause  extraintestinal, opportunistic infections., Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition  molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic  variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene  was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms  was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by  production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied  10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several  polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was  particularly interesting. In individuals heterozygous for the FCN3+1637delC  deletion lowered Ficolin-3 concentration was observed (P=0.025). SDS-PAGE and, Context: prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The  following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World  Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as  neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral  ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and  6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.  RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with  controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was  reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia.  Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with  unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain  injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters.

Which part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?,"Yes, a specific polymorphism in the TNFR2 gene, Met196Arg, is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese population.

Genotype  analysis revealed that the presence of one 196R allele was sufficient for  rendering susceptibility. The association of 196R allele with SLE was  independent from that of HLA-DRB1*1501. In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was  found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the  Japanese population. Further population and functional studies will be of  particular importance to establish TNFR2 as one of the susceptibility genes to  SLE., Context: Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors are considered to be involved  in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A number of previous  studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the  pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the  genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position  encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2).

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not provide any information about a resource that has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.","Context: elements of the α-globin super-enhancer individually and in informative  combinations, we demonstrate that each constituent enhancer seems to act  independently and in an additive fashion with respect to hematological  phenotype, gene expression, chromatin structure and chromosome conformation,  without clear evidence of synergistic or higher-order effects. Our study  highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for the identification  of new concepts in transcriptional regulation., Context:  Genomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and  post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In  this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer  lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by  them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate  imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin  compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning., Context: Immune responses to invading pathogens are mediated largely through a family of  transmembrane Toll-like receptors and modulated by a number of downstream  effectors. In particular, a family of four interleukin 1 receptor-associated  kinases (IRAK) regulates responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins. Pharmacological  targeting of particular IRAK components may be beneficial for treatment of  bacterial infections. Here, we studied transcriptional regulation of the human IRAK2 gene. Analysis of the IRAK2 promoter region reveals putative binding sites  for several transcriptional factors, including ZIP (EGR1 and SP1), CTCF and  AP-2beta. Deletion of the ZIP or AP-2 sites did not significantly affect IRAK2 promoter activity in naive and endotoxin-treated mononuclear cells, in dormant  and activated Jurkat T-cells, in lung and kidney cells. In contrast, we found  that CTCF plays a major role in IRAK2 transcription. An electrophoretic mobility, Context: E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that p65 translocation  into the nucleus prevented the recruitment of E2F1 to the PDK4 promoter and its  subsequent E2F1-dependent gene transcription. Interestingly, the NF-κB inhibitor  parthenolide prevented the inhibition of E2F1, while E2F1 overexpression reduced  interleukin expression in stimulated cardiac cells. Based on these findings, we  propose that NF-κB acts as a molecular switch that regulates E2F1-dependent PDK4  gene transcription., Context: observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the  strength of specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-α binding.  Cohesin, present on many ER-α-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment,  apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by  stabilizing E2/ER-α/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate  that eRNAs are likely to have important functions in many regulated programs of  gene transcription., Context: BACKGROUND: Gene expression is mediated by specialized cis-regulatory modules  (CRMs), the most prominent of which are called enhancers. Early experiments  indicated that enhancers located far from the gene promoters are often  responsible for mediating gene transcription. Knowing their properties,  regulatory activity, and genomic targets is crucial to the functional  understanding of cellular events, ranging from cellular homeostasis to differentiation. Recent genome-wide investigation of epigenomic marks has  indicated that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain epigenomic marks,  such as, combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. METHODS: Our efforts in this paper are motivated by these recent advances in  epigenomic profiling methods, which have uncovered enhancer-associated chromatin  features in different cell types and organisms.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that ""stress granules can form inclusions in the cytoplasm.""","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability., Context: protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. PCOS  model rats were established by dehydroepiandrosterone injection. Enzyme‑linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured serum sex hormones. Hematoxylin and eosin  (H&E) staining was used to examine histological changes of the ovarian tissues.  The expression levels of FKBP52 were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC)  staining, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR)  analysis and western blotting (WB).

The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene.

We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans.

AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle., Context: INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation  of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy was  identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to  H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our  knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H1N1 with  myocarditis in pregnancy.

CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if  myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of, Context: The diagnosis of myocarditis can be challenging given that symptoms, clinical  exam findings, electrocardiogram results, biomarkers, and echocardiogram results  are often non-specific. Endocardial biopsy is an established method for  diagnosing myocarditis, but carries the risk of complications and false negative  results.

Myocarditis can be diagnosed by using three tissue markers including edema,  hyperemia/capillary leak, and necrosis/fibrosis. The interpretation of cardiac  MR findings can be confusing, especially when the myocardium is diffusely involved. Using T1 and T2 maps, the diagnosis of myocarditis can be made even in  cases of global myocarditis with the help of quantitative analysis.

They putatively infiltrate the  orbit in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy where they appear to transition into  CD34(+) orbital fibroblasts (OFs) that interact with residential CD34(-)  fibroblasts. A unique phenotypic attribute of fibrocytes and CD34(+) OFs is  their expression of the functional thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and other  ""thyroid-specific"" proteins. When activated through TSHR, fibrocytes express a  number of cytokines and other inflammatory genes. Here we sought to determine  whether pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), an acute-phase protein involved in inflammation and autoimmunity, might be induced by TSH in fibrocytes and OFs. These cells were  collected from patients with Graves disease and healthy individuals. PTX-3 mRNA  levels were determined by real-time PCR, protein was determined by ELISA and Western blot, and PTX-3 gene promoter activity was assessed with reporter  assays. PTX-3 expression was induced by TSH in both cell types, regardless of  the health status of the donor and was a consequence of increased steady-state, Context:  It is now widely accepted that thyroid hormones, l-thyroxine (T(4)) and  3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3)), act as modulators of the immune response.  Immune functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and cytokine synthesis and release, are altered in hypo- and  hyper-thyroid conditions, even though for many immune cells no clear correlation  has been found between altered levels of T(3) or T(4) and effects on the immune responses. Integrins are extracellular matrix proteins that are important  modulators of many cellular responses, and the integrin αvβ3 has been identified  as a cell surface receptor for thyroid hormones. Rapid signaling via this plasma, Context:  Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates various metabolic pathways and the hepatic  actions of T3 are mediated primarily through the thyroid hormone receptor beta  (TRβ). Hypothyroidism has been linked with low grade inflammation, elevated risk of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are  associated with inflammation, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Due to  potential linkage between thyroid hormone and sPLA2, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormone status on the regulation of secretory phospholipases in mice,  rats and human liver. T3 suppressed the expression of the sPLA2 group IIa  (PLA2g2a) gene in the liver of BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 transgenic mice","21189433, 19926244, 19926244, 26287404, 22414628, 24440706",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,"Yes, thrombophilia is related to an increased risk of miscarriage. In the given context, it was mentioned that 13% of women with pregnancy-associated complications had antiphospholipid antibodies","Context: placental abruption. We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of  cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia., Context: Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may  interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. However, the  literature on this issue is conflicting. In investigating the relationship  between pregnancy-associated complications and the presence of thrombophilia  risk factors, we studied the records of 414 women who had been examined for  inherited and acquired thrombophilia in the period 1996 to 2006 because of pregnancy-associated complications. Of a total of 885 pregnancies among the  women, 397 were recorded as foetal loss/intrauterine foetal death during the  first (62 %), second (25 %) or third trimester (13 %). One-hundred-and-two (25 %) women had had a thromboembolic event during one of their pregnancies, and 98  (24 %) had had pre-eclampsia on at least one occasion. Intrauterine growth  restriction was found in 105 (25 %) of the women, and 29 (7 %) suffered, Context: BACKGROUND: Although some paternal components to the predisposition to  pre-eclampsia have been demonstrated recently, it is not known whether such  paternal factors play a role to thrombophilia-related perinatal mortality.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the paternal and maternal contribution to perinatal  mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Data from a prospective registry of perinatal mortality in a Dutch  healthcare region were used. Between December 1999 and May 2000, the prevalence  of thrombophilia was studied in 74 women with a history of perinatal mortality  (female cases) and 54 of their male partners (male cases). Seventy-one healthy  unrelated women after uneventful pregnancies only and 66 of their male partners were used as controls. SETTING: Obstetric outpatient clinic in a regional hospital (Remierde Graaf  Group, Deflt). METHODS: Presence of various coagulation abnormalities, hyperhomocysteinaemia  and anticardiolipins was investigated. RESULTS: The frequency of antithrombin deficiency (12% vs 0%), increased  activated protein C (APC) resistance (32% vs 6%), total protein S deficiency  (11% vs 1%) and elevated factor VIII:C activity (43% vs 17%) was significantly, Context:  PURPOSE: To determine if thrombophilia is a risk factor for placenta-mediated  pregnancy complications (PMPC) (i.e., preeclampsia, intrauterine growth  restriction (IUGR), placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death and recurrent  pregnancy loss). METHODS: A 5-year retrospective cohort study. Ongoing pregnancies in women with  an antecedent PMPC with thrombophilia were compared with the pregnancies in  similar women without thrombophilia. The main outcome measures were mean birth weight deviations, corrected for gestational age, and recurrence of PMPC.  Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was employed for thromboprophylaxis only.  Mann-Whitney's, Fisher's and Chi-square tests were employed for comparison., Context: with a previous pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia were observed in the next  pregnancy. They were evaluated for heritable thrombophilia (factor V Leiden and  factor II G20210A mutations, protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency),  hyperhomocystinemia, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies.  Development of preeclampsia and maternal complications and both gestational age  at delivery and birthweight were recorded.  RESULTS: Sixty women (34.9%) showed the presence of a thrombophilic defect. They  had a higher risk for the recurrence of preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.1), compared to patients without thrombophilia. Similar findings were observed considering only heritable thrombophilia.  Thrombophilic patients were at increased risk for the occurrence of very early  preterm delivery (< 32 weeks; OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 3.4-43.2). CONCLUSION: When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia,  screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and  pregnancy management.","19031171, 20860491, 19031171, 15713144, 22543699, 18845284","Thrombophilia has been found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the given context, it is mentioned that hesperidin exerts potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, implying its potential","Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats., Context: AIMS: There is increasing evidence showing that mild traumatic brain injury  (mTBI) is associated with increased depression-related disorders in humans.  Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural  flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury  and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its  neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse  model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the  antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid. MAIN METHODS: Ten days after mTBI-induction, mice received oral hesperidin  treatment (50 mg/kg/14 days), then animals were subjected to different  depression tests including sucrose preference test, forced swim test,, Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C. In hippocampal slice preparations, whole-cell patch clamp  experiments showed that hesperidin reduced the frequency of spontaneous, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line.","16964766, 22850463, 24211676, 30352242, 26342684, 24205431",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"

We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified  NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a  member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation., Context:  Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an inherited bleeding disorder associated with  macrothrombocytopenia and α-granule-deficient platelets. GPS has been linked to  loss of function mutations in NEABL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), and we describe here a murine GPS model, the Nbeal2(-/-) mouse. As in GPS, Nbeal2(-/-) mice exhibit  splenomegaly, macrothrombocytopenia, and a deficiency of platelet α-granules and  their cargo, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), thrombospondin-1, and platelet factor 4. The platelet α-granule membrane protein P-selectin is  expressed at 48% of wild-type levels and externalized upon platelet activation.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are chemically reactive intermediates that are formed during the metabolism of certain drugs. They can bind to cellular proteins and other molecules, leading to toxic effects. These metabolites are","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction. Although the reactive metabolite hypothesis is logical,  it has important implications for drug development, and we need to develop ways, Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites.

In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context: linked to the ingestion of the toxin hypoglycin A produced by ackee fruit. A  structural analogue of hypoglycin A, methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), was  implicated as the cause of an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Much of the  evidence linking hypoglycin A and MCPG to these diseases has been largely  circumstantial due to the lack of an analytical method for specific metabolites.  This study presents an analytical approach to identify and quantify specific  urine metabolites for exposure to hypoglycin A and MCPG. The metabolites are  excreted in urine as glycine adducts methylenecyclopropylacetyl-glycine  (MCPA-Gly) and methylenecyclopropylformyl-glycine (MCPF-Gly). These metabolites were processed by isotope dilution, separated by reverse-phase liquid  chromatography, and monitored by electrospray ionization tandem mass  spectrometry. The analytical response ratio was linearly proportional to the concentration of MCPF-Gly and MCPA-Gly in urine from 0.10 to 20 μg/mL with a  correlation coefficient of r > 0.99.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the features of Triple A syndrome include adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. Additionally, most patients have neurological","Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this  patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a  genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation., Context: The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is  characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal  insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and  dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient.

CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported., Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of, Context: METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of presentation and outcomes for  42 children with achalasia presenting over three decades to a major pediatric  referral center. Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by  questionnaire.  RESULTS: We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The  median overall age at diagnosis was 10.8 years and median follow-up 1593 days.  Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65%), while  initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by  myotomy in 17 (85%). Ten out of 35 patients who underwent myotomy required a  repeat myotomy (29%). Patients with triple A syndrome developed symptoms earlier, but had delayed diagnosis, were more underweight at diagnosis and at  last follow up. Questionnaire results suggested a significant long term  deleterious impact on the quality of life of children and their families. CONCLUSION: Many children with achalasia relapse after initial treatment,  undergoing multiple, different procedures, despite which symptoms persist and  impact on quality of life. Symptoms develop earlier in patients with triple A, Context: for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been  reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike  other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide  phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members  harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought  to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and  seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical,  biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The  results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and  displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from  hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development.
