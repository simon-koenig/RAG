What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas,","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.","23179372, 19270706, 14688019, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene encodes for DNA polymerase θ in humans. This is explicitly stated in the second sentence of the first context provided.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources.

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where there is subluxation of the lens due to disruption of the zonular fibers. It is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can either be isolated or associated","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, they target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed, but there is no mention of a specific established minimal genome. Instead, the context introduces an alternative concept","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored.

Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome.

In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change.

This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes., Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a","24681537, 12208845, 19687145, 21347206",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases. Likewise, the highest concentrations of this oncoprotein are found in patients with breast cancer, but lower concentrations  may be found in other malignancies, particularly ovarian, prostate and lung  cancer (mainly adenocarcinomas). HER-2/neu assay sensitivity in patients with, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of, Context:  PURPOSE: Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer.

Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential  component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells,  including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its  amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.

Chromatin insulators have emerged as one  of the central components of the genome organization tool-kit across species.  Recent advancements in chromatin conformation capture technologies have provided  important insights into the architectural role of insulators in genomic  structuring. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple  spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin  structure during reprogramming and differentiation.

The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.","22495300, 25479748, 26340639, 24346698, 23199754, 24905166, 25218583, 25693564, 24305663"
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context there is no evidence that thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations are implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The text only mentions mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival., Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.

In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy, Context: The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer  of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Several lines of  evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and  perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed,  the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and  with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Yes, the mode of inheritance of FSHD is autosomal dominant. This means that only one copy of the mutated gene, inherited from either parent, is sufficient to cause the disease.","Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years.

A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen.

Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke.

These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines.

We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase","25228534, 27707887, 24856155, 24670165","Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.","24891360, 24675041, 24980964, 26018086, 25258279, 25381900, 25101329, 25258420, 24670165, 25228534, 25733882, 25170107, 25458559"
Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, there is a deep learning system described in the context that can outperform human experts in detecting melanoma. This system employs very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with over 50 layers to extract","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following  reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of  pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two  fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously  produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification  results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed  for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. The proposed deep learning, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a computational tool called SSCprofiler is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions. It utilizes a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function to control gene expression.  These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth,  differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development  and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as  cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display  altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the  mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be  addressed. Moreover, the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted. Finally, the challenges regarding the translation of  research involving microRNAs to the clinical realm will be discussed., Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to","21406606, 19324892, 20925959, 20221895","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

These drugs are used in combination to treat Ewing's","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Ewing's sarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour occurring in children  and adolescents and exists in two different clinicopathological entities:  osseous Ewing's sarcoma (OES) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES). Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific  symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22  years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical  exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant  radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine,, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation., Context: present in the 2092 nucleotide interval.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker. It binds to phosphatidylserine which becomes exposed on the outer membrane of apoptotic cells.

Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process., Context:  The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces  is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based  apoptosis assays. In this paper, we report a new class of Annexin V-based probes for apoptosis. Luciferase from Renilla reniformis (RLuc) was linked to Annexin V  and expressed successfully in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of, Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues., Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is evident as genetic disorders that impair homologous recombinational repair (HRR), such as Ataxia telangiectasia (AT","Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, Yki in Drosophila is equivalent to YAP/TAZ in vertebrates, which are mammalian orthologs. This information can be derived from the context as it mentions that mutations in genes acting","Context: (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on  the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the  physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also  induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We  also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or  proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.  Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication  cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: Virus-induced cell death is a determinant of pathogenesis. Mammalian reovirus is a versatile experimental model for identifying viral and host  intermediaries that contribute to cell death and for examining how these factors  influence viral disease. In this study, we identified that in addition to apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death, reovirus is capable of inducing an  alternate form of controlled cell death known as necroptosis. Death by this  pathway perturbs the integrity of host membranes and likely triggers, Context: neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in  the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis., Context: phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing ≈50 kDa protein was detected in this  regard.

Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were  shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be  species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1.

What is the drug  gantenerumab targeting?,"Yes, gantenerumab targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. It is an investigational fully human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and remove beta-amy","Context: million people around the world. It is expected that the illness will affect  about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current  Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable  of slowing down disease progression. Indeed, all currently available therapies,  such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), are  primarily considered symptomatic therapies, although recent data also suggest  possible disease-modifying effects. Gantenerumab is an investigational fully  human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and  remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. This compound, currently undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials represents a promising agent with a  disease-modifying potential in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview  of gantenerumab ranging from preclinical studies to human clinical trials., Context: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic  and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease  process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target  β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological  hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging  anti-Aβ drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs  in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the  β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of  cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in, Context: The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors marked an important advancement in  the development of cancer therapeutics. Pembrolizumab is a selective humanized  IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits the programmed death-1 (PD-1)  receptor, an integral component of immune checkpoint regulation in the tumor  microenvironment. The drug is currently approved by the Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma and metastatic squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several published studies  demonstrate that single-agent pembrolizumab is safe and has efficacy in patients  with NSCLC. Many ongoing protocols are investigating the role of pembrolizumab in combination with other agents in lung cancer and various other cancer types.  We review the available data on pembrolizumab in NSCLC and examine the role of  potential predictive biomarkers of response to therapy., Context: Since the innovation of epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analog, providing treatment  for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the 1990s, two types of oral drugs,  endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, have  further improved therapy for PAH. In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH.","24255592, 27678025, 26588948, 23068290","Gantenerumab significantly reduced amyloid plaques, cerebrospinal fluid total tau, and phospho-tau181 and attenuated increases of neurofilament light chain.","33336218, 34155411, 34198582"
List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Yes, there are several proteins with HEAT repeats mentioned in the contexts. In the first context, Symplekin is described as having a HEAT domain. The second context discusses alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps,","Context: the use of adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the standard treatment for these  tumors, although several studies have documented that the current standard  combination chemotherapy is suboptimal. Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities. We present a  model in which an alpha-independent beta-Kap progenitor gave rise to the  alpha-dependent beta-Kaps and the alpha-Kaps., Context: The titan (ttn) mutants of Arabidopsis exhibit striking alterations in  chromosome dynamics and cell division during seed development. Endosperm defects  include aberrant mitoses and giant polyploid nuclei. Mutant embryos differ in  cell size, morphology and viability, depending on the locus involved. Here we  demonstrate that three TTN genes encode chromosome scaffold proteins of the  condensin (SMC2) and cohesin (SMC1 and SMC3) classes. These proteins have been studied extensively in yeast and animal systems, where they modulate chromosome  condensation, chromatid separation, and dosage compensation. Arabidopsis  contains single copies of SMC1 and SMC3 cohesins. We used forward genetics to identify duplicate T-DNA insertions in each gene. These mutants (ttn7 and ttn8)  have similar titan phenotypes: giant endosperm nuclei and arrested embryos with  a few small cells.

There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation., Context: BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for human diseases of the lung,  heart, circulatory system and various kinds of cancers, and is a serious public  health problem worldwide. Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality  for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects.

RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate  that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD., Context:  OBJECTIVE: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that  metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy. METHODS: In a sample of 118 Scandinavian patients with treatment-resistant  depression who are naive to MAOI therapy, we investigated the associations  between a common MAOA functional promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR),, Context: Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).

In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in  transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalized following temsirolimus treatment.  In this mouse model with relatively mild disease progression, the number of  transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small.  However, the importance of these transcriptional alterations in the pathogenesis  of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 remains unclear., Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and  Machado-Joseph disease or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) are three  distinctive forms of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) caused by  expansions of an unstable CAG repeat localized in the coding region of the  causative genes. Another related disease, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy  (DRPLA) is also caused by an unstable triplet repeat and can present as SCA in late onset patients. We investigated the frequency of the SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3  and DRPLA mutations in 328 Brazilian patients with SCA, belonging to 90  unrelated families with various patterns of inheritance and originating in different geographic regions of Brazil. We found mutations in 35 families (39%),  32 of them with a clear autosomal dominant inheritance. The frequency of the  SCA1 mutation was 3% of all patients; and 6% in the dominantly inherited SCAs., Context:  AIMS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar  ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding  ataxin-3. The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the  loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the  cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of SCA3-associated  peripheral neuropathy, we performed nerve conduction studies and  histopathological analyses. Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 18 SCA3, Context: Expanded CAG repeat sequences have been identified in the coding region of genes  mutated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia  type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. They can stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome, making them attractive delivery vehicles for persistent transgene expression. Both simple retroviral vectors and lentiviral vectors","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency","21247248, 16717285, 14683449, 24158830","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The brief negative feelings range in severity from wistfulness to self-loathing, and appear to have a physiological cause. The authors suggest  that an abrupt drop in dopamine may occur when milk release is triggered,  resulting in a real or relative brief dopamine deficit for affected women.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No, according to the context, tumour specific antigens are not necessarily originating from known protein coding genes. They can also emerge de novo from ancestral non-coding DNAs as mentioned in the first part of the context","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context:  Tinkering with pre-existing genes has long been known as a major way to create  new genes.

In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion.

The mean admission  simplified MELD score for the patients who died was significantly higher than  for those surviving beyond discharge (11.3 ± 4.1 vs 5.8 ± 4.0; P = 0.001). By  multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality  included higher simplified MELD score (P = 0.001) and tricuspid valve  replacement (P = 0.023). In-hospital mortality and morbidity increased along  with increasing simplified MELD score. Scores <0, 0-6.9, 7-13.9 and >14 were associated with mortalities of 0, 2.0, 8.3 and 66.7%, respectively. The  incidence of serious complications (multiple organ failure, P = 0.005; prolonged  ventilation, P = 0.01; need for haemodialysis; P = 0.002) was also significantly higher in patients with simplified MELD score ≥ 7.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"No, evolocumab does not target an enzyme. Instead, it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.

Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes.

The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: The detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for the  prediction of functional associations of proteins, including physical  interactions or complex formation. These predictions are obtained by the  detection of similarity for pairs of 'component' proteins to 'composite'  proteins. Since the amount of composite proteins is limited in nature, we  augment this set by creating artificial fusion proteins from experimentally  determined protein interacting pairs. The goal is to study the extent of protein  interaction partners with increasing phylogenetic distance, using an automated  method. We have thus detected component pairs within seven entire genome sequences of similar size, using artificially generated composite proteins that  have been shown to interact experimentally. Our results indicate that protein  interactions are not conserved over large phylogenetic distances.

METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein  (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief  that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk,  stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly  characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets  only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP  granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and  adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for  cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct  responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific  RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified. Previously underappreciated, transcriptome  profiling in the RG may contribute to understanding human diseases associated  with RNP dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegeneration., Context: METHODS: We report here the making of MRG002, a novel HER2-targeted antibody  drug conjugate (ADC), and preclinical characterization including pharmacology,  pharmacodynamics and toxicology and discuss its potential as a novel agent for  treating patients with HER2-positive solid tumors.

Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen.

Our study  highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for the identification  of new concepts in transcriptional regulation., Context:  Genomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and  post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In  this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer  lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by  them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate  imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin  compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning., Context: Immune responses to invading pathogens are mediated largely through a family of  transmembrane Toll-like receptors and modulated by a number of downstream  effectors. In particular, a family of four interleukin 1 receptor-associated  kinases (IRAK) regulates responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins. Pharmacological  targeting of particular IRAK components may be beneficial for treatment of  bacterial infections. Here, we studied transcriptional regulation of the human IRAK2 gene. Analysis of the IRAK2 promoter region reveals putative binding sites  for several transcriptional factors, including ZIP (EGR1 and SP1), CTCF and  AP-2beta. Deletion of the ZIP or AP-2 sites did not significantly affect IRAK2 promoter activity in naive and endotoxin-treated mononuclear cells, in dormant  and activated Jurkat T-cells, in lung and kidney cells. In contrast, we found  that CTCF plays a major role in IRAK2 transcription. An electrophoretic mobility, Context: E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that p65 translocation  into the nucleus prevented the recruitment of E2F1 to the PDK4 promoter and its  subsequent E2F1-dependent gene transcription. Interestingly, the NF-κB inhibitor  parthenolide prevented the inhibition of E2F1, while E2F1 overexpression reduced  interleukin expression in stimulated cardiac cells. Based on these findings, we  propose that NF-κB acts as a molecular switch that regulates E2F1-dependent PDK4  gene transcription.","27376235, 26004516, 15670593, 21625432",Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines is a data and tool resource to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.,27710791
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that FUS inclusions (which are stress granules) are observed in the cytoplasm, and later on, it","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: promote germ cell development in the early embryo and establish the germ line  for the next generation. Similarly, select neuronal mRNA transcripts are  packaged into translationally inert RNA granules, transported to sites where  their protein products are required, and only then activated and translated.  Following translation, however, newly inactivated mRNAs released from polysomes  can also be packaged into dynamic, transient structures known as stress granules  (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs). Stress granules are composed largely of  stalled preinitiation complexes, and contain mRNA, small ribosomal subunits,  eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP, as their core components. PBs are associated with mRNA decay and contain the decapping enzymes DCP1/2, the 5' to 3' exonuclease  Xrn1, the Lsm proteins (1-7), and the scaffolding proteins hedls/GE-1 and GW182.  Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and various regulators of mRNA stability and translation (TTP, RCK/p54, and CPEB).  Thus, SGs and PBs share some protein and mRNA components, but also contain a  number of unique markers specific to each structure.

This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells., Context: Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously  described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing.

Which viruses are best known to cause myocarditis?,"Yes, enteroviruses are best known to cause myocarditis. The context states that enteroviruses have been considered the most common cause of acute myocarditis and a possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy","Context:  Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute  myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle., Context: Enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are small, non-enveloped  RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which are known or suspected to cause  a spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans. Although most infected persons  are asymptomatic, mild presentations can include respiratory infections,  herpangina, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Among the more severe syndromes  associated with EV and HPeV infection are acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and sepsis. Neonates and infants are at higher risk  for infection and for severe clinical outcomes than older children or adults  (1–3). As of August 2015, a total of 16 HPeV types and 118 EV types (within four EV species known to infect humans: A, B, C, and D) had been identified, and the  spectrum of illness caused differed among virus types (4). To describe trends in  EV and HPeV circulating in the United States during 2009–2013, CDC summarized, Context: Amplification for Adenovirus Type 3, Human Herpes Virus Type 6 and Enterovirus  genomes were performed by nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction. Finally the  virus-positive samples were direct sequenced.  RESULTS: In 2 patients Adenovirus Type 3 and in 1 patient both Adenovirus Type 3  and Human Herpes Virus Type 6 were detected. No enteroviruses were found in any  heart tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In our study the adenovirus genome was found to be the most  frequent virus genome in explanted heart tissues. The identified viral sequences  proved previous viral infection, which could have played a role in the  development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Detection of different viruses in the myocardium by molecular biological examinations might contribute to adequate  treatment of these patients., Context: The results are presented of serological tests by the neutralization method for  antigens of Coxsackie B group, and by the haemagglutination inhibition method  for three types of parainfluenza and sporadic influenza virus in 529 patients  with myocarditis.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the given contexts, it is shown to have protective effects against Alzheimer's disease progression, 3-NP-induced Huntington","Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats., Context: AIMS: There is increasing evidence showing that mild traumatic brain injury  (mTBI) is associated with increased depression-related disorders in humans.  Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural  flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury  and depression.

It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction. Although the reactive metabolite hypothesis is logical,  it has important implications for drug development, and we need to develop ways, Context: characterization of reactive metabolites.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the features of Triple A syndrome include adrenal insufficiency, alacrima (absence of tears), achalasia (a disorder of the esophagus), and neurological abnormalities. The","Context: Allgrove syndrome (or triple-A syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency (glucocorticoid in  the majority of cases) and autonomic/neurological abnormalities. This disease is  now known to be caused by mutation in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13.  Diagnosis should be readily available when the full-blown features are there,  but it becomes less apparent when presentation is atypical or in the evolving process. We present a brother and sister (12 and 19 y old, respectively) born to  consanguineous parents of Palestinian origin with Allgrove syndrome. The index  patient was erroneously diagnosed to be a case of familial dysautonomia before the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was made at the age of 7.5 y, while his  elder sister had only alacrima from birth and developed achalasia at the age of  15 y. She started to develop early evidence of adrenal disease at the age of 19, Context:  BACKGROUND: Triple-A syndrome (Allgrove syndrome) is an autosomal recessive  disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and -  occasionally - autonomic instability. Mutations have been found in the AAAS gene  on 12q13. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 12 year-old boy with classic  systemic features of triple-A syndrome and several prominent ophthalmic  features, including: accommodative spasm, dry eye, superficial punctate keratopathy, and pupillary hypersensitivity to dilute pilocarpine. MRI showed  small lacrimal glands bilaterally. DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments  from the 16 exons of the AAAS gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a new,, Context: The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the  syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis. In one patient with isolated achalasia, the diagnosis of triple A syndrome could only be made on the basis of  the molecular genetic analysis of the AAAS gene. We therefore suggest that the  diagnosis of triple A syndrome should be considered in patients who exhibit only, Context: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare disease, and  presents mainly in children. Its cardinal symptoms are achalasia, alacrima, and  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity. We report three cases of  Triple A syndrome. Our aim is to inform pediatric surgeons about the existence  of this rare syndrome and to highlight the need for suspicion of alacrima and  ACTH insensitivity in cases of pediatric achalasia. Triple A syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with achalasia. Alacrima should be  investigated by a Schirmer test, and adrenal dysfunction should be tested in  cases of suspected triple A.","16938764, 15217518, 12752575, 27385299","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.
