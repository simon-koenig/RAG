What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.","23179372, 19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye is subluxated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It is genetically heterogeneous and can either be isolated or associated","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets.

Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads.","22544737, 28459942, 25500879","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on what the ""minimal genome build"" is. Instead, it discusses the challenges in defining a universal minimal genome due to the strong context-dependency of essential genes and the lack of consensus","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits H4 K20 methylation. In the study, it was found that PR-Set7, which is cell cycle-regulated, is responsible for increased H4 Lys 20 methylation","Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines.

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK,"Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.","24856155, 27707887, 25228534","Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.","24891360, 24675041, 24980964, 26018086, 25258279, 25381900, 25101329, 25258420, 24670165, 25228534, 25733882, 25170107, 25458559"

Main outcome measures were  sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models called SSCprofiler is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions. This method integrates sequence, structure and conservation information","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function to control gene expression.  These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth,  differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development  and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as  cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display  altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the  mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be  addressed. Moreover, the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted. Finally, the challenges regarding the translation of  research involving microRNAs to the clinical realm will be discussed.","21406606, 19324892, 20925959","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment.

However, at","Context: cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7  and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation. METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A, Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients.

RESULTS: Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human. In addition to a well-known association with developmental genes, these DNA elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential  cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate  immunity, and sensory reception. Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved, Context: Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating  T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid  enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lef1  partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover,  depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs without exogenous factors, cytokines or inhibitors. Transcriptome  resequencing analysis reveals that LEF1 is closely associated with endoderm  specification in ESCs. Thus, our study adds support to the notion that the key to maintaining the ESC ground state is to shield ESCs from differentiative cues., Context: distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human.

In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542., Context: RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial  neoplasm (n = 352). Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02× increased  odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031,  CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic  curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day  readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts  a 0.98× reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99,  C-statistic = 0.70). But LACE+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P =  0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the LACE+ index is not  yet suitable as a prediction model for 30-day readmission in a brain tumor  population., Context: included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching  status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows  analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes.","30040677, 30926557, 23696773","The LACE index is a simple tool that includes 4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months.

Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context: cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,  antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context: expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage.

Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis.

Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, bupropion is used as a treatment for three indications. It was developed as an antidepressant, it is also used as a tobacco use cessation agent, and it is being tested in clinical trials as a candidate","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials,  bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL).

MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration.

Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy. METHODS: In a sample of 118 Scandinavian patients with treatment-resistant  depression who are naive to MAOI therapy, we investigated the associations  between a common MAOA functional promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR),, Context: METHODS: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the  influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and  diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals:  20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).

Here, retrovir","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No, tumour specific antigens do not necessarily originate from known protein coding genes. They mostly arise by point mutations and can be individual-specific, making them a more potent target for immunotherapy but also more challenging to identify","Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,, Context:  Tinkering with pre-existing genes has long been known as a major way to create  new genes.

On the basis of comparing the RNA expression profiles in the, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

Our empirical analysis shows that the method yields  reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional  important changes in histone modifications. To further explore the broader  applicability of MMDiff, we apply it to two ENCODE data sets: one investigating  the histone modification H3K27ac and one measuring the genome-wide binding of  the transcription factor CTCF. In both cases, MMDiff proves to be complementary  to count-based methods. In addition, we can show that MMDiff is capable of  directly detecting changes of homotypic binding events at neighbouring binding  sites. MMDiff is readily available as a Bioconductor package.

TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients.

Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA1 are FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, endogenous GATA1 and LDB1. These","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes.","12032775, 18844071, 16888367","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"
Which proteins does RG-7992 target?,I don't know. The context provided does not mention the protein targeted by RG-7992.,"Context: disadvantage of traditional IP and co-IP is that the conditions used to elute  the precipitated antigen also release the antibody thus contaminating the  antigen and destroying the antibody support. To overcome these problems, we  describe two methods to generate a reusable antibody support by cross-linking  the antibody to immobilized Protein A or Protein G, or by coupling it directly  to the resin (see Scheme 1). Antibody cross-linking can be done in 1 h while  antibody coupling requires 4 h. IP or co-IP is accomplished by incubating the  antibody resin with the protein sample. Washes and elutions are carried out in a  spin column to reduce resin loss and decrease assay time. Target proteins are eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.8) and the resin-bound antibody is  re-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for reuse. Our studies have  demonstrated that the immobilization efficiency for the antibody coupling method was similar for several species of antibody. Furthermore, we illustrate that  using both methods of antibody immobilization yield IP and co-IP results similar  to traditional protocols but eliminate the antibody heavy and light chain  contamination., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: biomarker investigation.

Instead, it discusses the role of GRG5 in embryonic stem cell fate decisions and T-cell","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that, Context: stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context as stress granules are described as forming ""in the cytoplasm"" and further detailed information is provided about their behavior in this cellular","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of","20674093, 24090136, 25437551",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides.

To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are chemically reactive species that are generated during the metabolism of certain drugs within the body. They can bind covalently to cellular proteins, leading to potential toxic effects and idiosyncr","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking.

Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression.

Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established.
