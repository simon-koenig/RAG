What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent","23179372, 19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene encodes for DNA polymerase θ in humans. This is explicitly stated in the context.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by, Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered).

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68. This information is provided in","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye is subluxated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It is genetically heterogeneous and can either be isolated or associated","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They protect genome integrity by silencing foreign genes such as transposons. Additionally, Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the  absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing.

Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase.

In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, according to the context, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. This is stated in the first and second paragraphs where it mentions that DICO induces Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release","Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events.

In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis. The identification of MALAT-1 emphasizes  the potential role of noncoding RNAs in human cancer.","22088988, 22722759, 12970751",Malat-1 expression is upregulated in several tumor types,"21266177, 16878148, 24163781, 22722759, 21678027, 16441420, 18006640, 23845456, 20007090, 22858678, 23726266, 15552795, 22088988, 12970751"

Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside, Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. During epidermal, Context: organization of the eukaryotic genomes. Chromatin insulators have emerged as one  of the central components of the genome organization tool-kit across species.  Recent advancements in chromatin conformation capture technologies have provided  important insights into the architectural role of insulators in genomic  structuring. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple  spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin  structure during reprogramming and differentiation.

Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not associated with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. The text specifically mentions that affected family members do not have","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy., Context:  Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity  for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths., Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two main symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome. They are idiopathic intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities.","Context: OBJECTIVES: As the disease can display different clinical presentations, which  are mainly unspecific, and considering the importance of an early diagnosis and  the proper and early management of it, this study was carried out to present a  general overview of VHL. Moreover, the present article reviews screening methods  and emphasizes the need for increasing the awareness of different health care  professionals to diagnose and refer the patients in the early stages.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of internet medical databases, such as  PubMed, was carried out on known or suggested; clinical presentations,  pathogenesis, screening, causes and criteria for diagnosis of patients and their  referrals. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that VHL is caused by a mutation in the von  Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. It also showed that different screening methods can be  utilized for the early diagnosis and referral of patients. Different clinical presentations of the disease are also elaborated in some detail and their  treatment options are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the need for a multidisciplinary approach to VHL,, Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome., Context: tumors. We report, a 14-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of  aplastic anemia (AA). Subsequent bone marrow examination and multiparametric  flowcytometric immunophenotyping revealed an evolving hypoplastic acute myeloid  leukemia. Chromosomal breakage studies using clastogenic agent mitomycin C  showed 88% stress induced chromosomal/chromatid breaks, gaps and rearrangements  revealing an underlying FA. The case emphasizes upon the role of a systematic  clinico-investigative approach in diagnosing such patients who by clinical  criteria appear to have idiopathic AA and appear phenotypically normal. A timely  and accurate diagnosis becomes vital in these cases to implement appropriate  therapy.","23843833, 19498211, 24604962","Aagenaes syndrome, also called lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1, is characterized by neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis, often lessening and becoming intermittent with age and severe chronic lymphoedema, mainly affecting the lower extremities.","12712065, 11446017, 19498211, 9350821, 8278949, 24086631, 10968776, 16635916, 27614462, 25039919, 20170991, 23626552, 25317502"
What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 affects chromatin by regulating its compaction and gene repression. However, it's not a direct consequence of PRC2 deregulation in cancer cells. Instead, histone deacetylase inhib","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context:  PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival., Context: The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer  of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Several lines of  evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and  perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed,  the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and  with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene. The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a  candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype. We  report here the genomic structure and fine mapping of the EZH2 gene. We demonstrate that the functional gene actually maps to chromosome 7q35 and that  the sequence previously isolated from a chromosome 21 cosmid corresponds to a  pseudogene.

In many parts of the world cholera  is still endemic, causing outbreaks and constituting repeatedly serious public  health problems. The oral live cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Orochol, Mutachol),  the first genetically modified organism (GMO) used as vaccine, was in its time  (launched 1993, Switzerland) the ideal cholera vaccine: single-dose, protective  efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union.

In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: BACKGROUND: Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine  class. It has limited effects on myocardial contractility; is available in a  powder-filled capsule and has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours.

Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context: examining the role of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma development were performed by  re-expression of PCDH10 in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, and then, cell  proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration assays were  performed.  RESULTS: We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3  harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is  down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other  mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression. We found that DNA  hypermethylation contributed to the deregulation of PCDH10 in 11/44 (25%) of  medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumours. Using a stable cell line (DAOY) re-expressing PCDH10, we observed that cell migration was impaired upon  restoration of PCDH10 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to  express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby  contributing to medulloblastoma progression., Context: medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,"Yes, the phosphatase inhibited by LB-100 is protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This information is explicitly stated in the context.","Context: protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their  anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR  sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and  its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an  inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or  calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory  effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated  with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal  histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with  both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake,  storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA  interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival, Context: treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor  of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction  by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro. The antitumor effects of combining LB-100  with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the  radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic  assays.

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK,"Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.","24856155, 27707887, 25228534","Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.","24891360, 24675041, 24980964, 26018086, 25258279, 25381900, 25101329, 25258420, 24670165, 25228534, 25733882, 25170107, 25458559"
Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"No, such a system isn't mentioned in the context. While there are multiple descriptions of deep learning systems for melanoma detection, none are claimed to outperform human experts in accuracy.","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and","29047032, 28026754, 29439500","in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

RESULTS: A multi-step approach combining microarray miRNA and mRNA expression  profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the CRC specific  miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. First, 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and  2916 mRNAs from CRC samples and their corresponding normal epithelial tissues  were identified by miRNA and mRNA microarray, respectively. Secondly, 22  dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target mRNAs (72 miRNA-mRNA pairs) were  identified by a combination of Pearson's correlation analysis and prediction by databases TargetScan and miRanda.

Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes.

It seems that microRNAs act as major regulators of gene  expression. In this review, we discuss microRNAs' role in cancer and how  microRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their gene targets.  Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites has indicated several  novel potential gene targets involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastatic  mechanisms. Matching computational prediction analysis together with microarray  data seems the best method for microRNA gene target identification.

What is included in the LACE Index?,"Yes, the LACE index includes four parameters related to a patient's hospital stay. These are: 1. Length of stay (L) 2. Acuity of admission (A) 3. Comorbidity (C)","Context: Predictive models for hospital readmission rates are in high demand because of  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Readmission  Reduction Program (HRRP). The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial  neoplasm (n = 352). Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02× increased  odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031,  CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic  curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day  readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts  a 0.98× reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99,  C-statistic = 0.70). But LACE+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P =  0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the LACE+ index is not  yet suitable as a prediction model for 30-day readmission in a brain tumor  population., Context: included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching  status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows  analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes.","29148921, 30926557, 23696773","The LACE index is a simple tool that includes 4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months.

Does the association of PARP1 and CTCF follow a circadian rhythm?,"Yes, according to the context, the interaction of PARP1 and CTCF follows a circadian rhythm. The study mentions that synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CT","Context:  Circadian rhythms are endogenous and self-sustained oscillations of multiple  biological processes with approximately 24-h rhythmicity. Circadian genes and  their protein products constitute the molecular components of the circadian oscillator that form positive/negative feedback loops and generate circadian  rhythms. The circadian regulation extends from core clock genes to various  clock-controlled genes that include various cell cycle genes. Aberrant expression of circadian clock genes, therefore, may lead to genomic instability  and accelerated cellular proliferation potentially promoting carcinogenesis. The  current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four, Context: enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina-associated domains (LADs).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is evident as genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability often involve genes critical for homologous recombinational repair (H","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context: DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually  cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination, antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit","12427531, 20298636, 23675572",Yes.

Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour.

Six different  algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated  using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying  complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and  combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total  >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported  proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported  proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of  search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The  results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying, Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins. All alpha-Kaps contain a central domain composed  of eight approximately 40 amino acid, tandemly arranged, armadillo-like (Arm)  repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals.

Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation.

Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).  Our results suggest that the high-activity allele class of MAOA-u VNTR in males  may be involved in susceptibility to a persistent course of methamphetamine, Context:  OBJECTIVE: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that  metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs).

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. This is evident in the context as it states that ""The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating gene transfer vectors has been limited..."". Ret","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy.

We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context: Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in  gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), particularly in immunosuppressed recipient hosts. However,  in the latest packaging cell lines and vectors, the risk of RCR-generation has  been drastically reduced, primarily by minimizing the homologous overlap between","21247248, 16717285, 14683449","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

All three women described the sudden onset of negative  feelings at the initiation of each breastfeeding session. The dysphoria vanished  after each milk ejection. DISCUSSION: Literature on D-MER is limited to one published qualitative research  study and two published case reports.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, according to the context, some tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. These are often tumour-associated differentiation antigens that result from gene products which are preferentially transcribed in the tum","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context:  Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

The package is based on statist","Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, the context does provide information about the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab. Evolocumab targets the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzym","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved.

In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, camels are the animals thought to transmit the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to humans. This is based on epidemiological evidence and experimental data showing that camels are perm","Context:  Coronaviruses are pathogens with a serious impact on human and animal health.  They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life  threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in  humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections,  and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This  highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these  viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses,, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches, Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed.","28643204, 25791336, 28616501",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

Our study  highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for the identification  of new concepts in transcriptional regulation., Context:  Genomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and  post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In  this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer  lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by  them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate  imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin  compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning., Context: erythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote  erythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts.  Erythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate  beyond proerythroblast stage and showed massive apoptosis. These biologic  effects of Gfi-1B were mediated through its zinc finger domain, but not by the  SNAG or non-zinc finger domain. Proliferation of erythroblasts was associated  with sustained expression of GATA-2 but not of GATA-1, indicating a potential  link between Gfi-1B and GATA family regulators. Importantly, the function of  Gfi-1B to modulate transcription was dependent on promoter context. In addition, activation of transcription of an artificial promoter was mediated through its  zinc finger domain. These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid  regulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid cell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression.","27376235, 26004516, 12351384",Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines is a data and tool resource to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.,27710791
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that ""large PABP1-positive cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of","20674093, 24090136, 25437551",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism., Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the context provided, it was shown to protect neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases due to its potent antio","Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C.

We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma.

Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by  questionnaire.  RESULTS: We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The  median overall age at diagnosis was 10.8 years and median follow-up 1593 days.  Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65%), while  initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by  myotomy in 17 (85%).

CONCLUSION: Many children with achalasia relapse after initial treatment,  undergoing multiple, different procedures, despite which symptoms persist and  impact on quality of life. Symptoms develop earlier in patients with triple A, Context: The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the  syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and  molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis. In one patient with isolated achalasia, the diagnosis of triple A syndrome could only be made on the basis of  the molecular genetic analysis of the AAAS gene. We therefore suggest that the  diagnosis of triple A syndrome should be considered in patients who exhibit only one or two of the main symptoms (i.e. alacrima, achalasia or adrenal  insufficiency). These patients require careful neurological investigation, and  mutation analysis of the AAAS gene should be performed., Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this  patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test.

A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE. Any part of the  heart can be affected, including the pericardium, myocardium, coronary arteries,  valves, and the conduction system. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, a high incidence of CAD has become increasingly recognized as a cause of  mortality, especially in older adult patients and those with long-standing SLE.  Many unanswered questions remain in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac manifestations of SLE. It is not currently possible to predict the  patients who are at greatest risk for the various types of cardiac involvement.  However, with the rapid advancement of basic science and translational research","26366317, 25186992, 24268009","In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), brain and kidney are the most frequently affected organs. The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. Other affected organs in SLE-AAC included hematologic system (11, 84.6%), followed by mucocutaneous (seven, 53.8%), musculoskeletal (seven, 53.8%) and neuropsychiatric (two, 15.4%) systems.","24268009, 25186992, 7588946, 28355987, 19758166, 21767292"
