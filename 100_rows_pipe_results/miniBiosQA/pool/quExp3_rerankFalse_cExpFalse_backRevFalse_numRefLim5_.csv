Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later,, Context: the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within, Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this, Context: North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous.
