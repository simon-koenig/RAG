What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has implications in medulloblastoma. Specifically, H3K27 methylation plays a role in Group 3 and Group 4 tumors. These groups have higher levels of","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, there are four lncRNAs regulated by SAM68. They are Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2. This is","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.",29137239,"Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
What is ectopia lentis?,Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition characterized by the displacement of the eye's lens from its normal position. This displacement can be inherited as an isolated trait or be a symptom of underlying systemic conditions.,"Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging.

Describe RIblast,"No, the context does not provide information about RIblast.","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),",22544737,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are indeed involved in gene silencing. They function as guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in the germline by repressing transposons post-transcriptionally and","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on a minimal genome build. Instead, it mentions that a universal minimal genome remains elusive due to various factors like context-dependency and lack of consensus in defining essential genes. The text propos","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and",23219343,"The identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and essence of life forms.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, the MALAT1 long non-coding RNA is misregulated in many human cancers and is often upregulated. This upregulation leads to its abundance in various types of cancer.","Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, the 3D structure of the genome does not remain stable during cell differentiation. According to the review, the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development.","Context: Recent burst of new technologies that allow for quantitatively delineating  chromatin structure has greatly expanded our understanding of how the genome is  organized in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus. It is now clear  that the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome critically impacts  nuclear activities such as transcription, replication, as well as cellular and  developmental events such as cell cycle, cell fate decision and embryonic  development. In this review, we discuss new insights into how the structural  features of the 3D genome hierarchy are established and maintained, how this  hierarchy undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development and how its perturbation will lead to human disease, highlighting the accumulating evidence  that links the diverse 3D genome architecture components to a multitude of human  diseases and the emerging mechanisms by which 3D genome derangement causes disease phenotypes.",29990539,"Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.","22495300, 25479748, 26340639, 24346698, 23199754, 24905166, 25218583, 25693564, 24305663"

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"No, the context does not support the idea that EZH2 directly affects chromatin. Instead, it suggests that histone deacetylase inhibitors can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression without altering H3K","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures.

We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, according to the context, retroviruses are indeed used for gene therapy. This is mentioned in the opening sentence when discussing the therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses. However, it's also noted that","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,",21247248,"Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.
