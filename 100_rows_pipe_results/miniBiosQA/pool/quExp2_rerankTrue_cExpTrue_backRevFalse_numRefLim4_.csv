What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where there is subluxation of the lens due to disruption of zonular fibers. It is genetically heterogeneous and can either be isolated or associated with systemic","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. According","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.

Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a universal minimal genome is still elusive in the field of synthetic biology, as ""minimal sets"" of essential genes are strongly context","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored.

In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes.

This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from  the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate  that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule  inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies.","24681537, 12208845, 27131378, 21940714",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Which is the protein encoded by the human gene GRIK?,"Yes, the human gene GRIK encodes for the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Specifically, it encodes for a principal subunit of this type of receptor.","Context:  Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are neurovascular dysplasias that result  in mulberry-shaped lesions predominantly located in brain and spinal tissues.  Mutations in three genes are associated with CCM. These genes encode for the proteins KRIT1/CCM1 (krev interaction trapped 1/cerebral cavernous malformations  1), cerebral cavernous malformations 2, osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3  (CCM2/malcavernin/OSM), and cerebral cavernous malformations 3/programmed cell death 10 (CCM3/PDCD10). There have been many significant recent advances in our  understanding of the structure and function of these proteins, as well as in  their roles in cellular signaling. Here, we provide an update on the current, Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression  pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in  presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context: Encephalitis induced by reovirus serotype 3 (T3) strains results from the  apoptotic death of infected neurons. Extrinsic apoptotic signaling is activated  in reovirus-infected neurons in vitro and in vivo, but the role of intrinsic  apoptosis signaling during encephalitis is largely unknown. Bax plays a key role  in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of  mitochondrial cytochrome c. We found Bax activation and cytochrome c release in neurons following infection of neonatal mice with T3 reoviruses.

In summary, anti-IL-6 therapy for  non-infectious uveitis shows promise in terms of efficacy and side effect  profile., Context:  The new direct oral anticoagulants directly targeting thrombin (factor IIa) or  factor-Xa, are currently used for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and  pulmonary embolism (rivaroxaban, Xarelto) or for the prevention of systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (rivaroxaban; dabigatran, Pradaxa;  Apixaban, Eliquis). Given their ease of use, it is expected that these drugs  would be widely used in such long-term indications. Beyond their effectiveness, these treatments remain anticoagulant drugs, potentially responsible for  bleeding complications, and specific measures should be defined in case of  occurrence of such complications., Context:  Apixaban (Eliquis®) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for  use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Like other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban has generally predictable pharmacological properties and does not require routine  anticoagulation monitoring. In large phase III trials, oral apixaban was  noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapped with and followed by oral warfarin (enoxaparin/warfarin) in the treatment of adults with acute VTE  over 6 months with regard to the incidence of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death  (AMPLIFY), and was significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention, Context:  Apixaban (Eliquis™), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being developed by  Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer as a therapy for the prevention and/or treatment  of thrombotic disorders. Apixaban has been approved in the EU for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hip or knee replacement. A rolling  submission for approval of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients  with atrial fibrillation has also been initiated in the US.

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-1","Context: patients with atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Available systemic drugs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  are limited. There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen.  Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment  of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2)  allergic inflammation are promising. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody  to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published  efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. A number  of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in  atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin).  Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval  of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis.

When was vaxchora first licensed by the FDA?,"Yes, the context does provide an answer for this question. Vaxchora was first licensed by the FDA in June 2016. This information can be inferred from the fact that the context discusses the approval of Vax","Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to  these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections., Context: STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that addressed the safety and  efficacy of Vaxchora, the reformulated, single-dose oral CVD 103-HgR cholera  vaccine, were selected for analysis.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, the context indicates that isradipine is used as a therapy for hypertension. This is evident from the mention of the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS","Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa,  metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood  pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another  antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to  monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective  in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and  that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and  hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when  administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of  isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of  carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased  significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of  therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder, Context: ventricular mass and no indication in mean circumferential shortening. There was  another indication of improved left ventricular performance. With the reduced  left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the  ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left  ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic  wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The  directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo.

Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in  medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation. PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the, Context: BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours  affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups.  Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of  tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes  (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput  genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations. Here, we have  mutagenised the Ptch+/- murine tumour model using the Sleeping Beauty transposon  system to identify additional genes and pathways involved in SHH subgroup  medulloblastoma development. RESULTS: Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and  identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically  mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription  factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1  and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes","12384556, 12384556, 20717685, 24252690","Medulloblastomas are the most frequent malignant brain tumors affecting children.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines.

We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs.

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition.

In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites.

At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma  membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing.

Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"Yes, TERRA is an ultraconserved element associated with ESC self-renewal. It promotes self-renewal by inhibiting the transcription of TCF3, a downstream target that represses","Context: overexpressed. Further studies revealed that T cell factor 3 ( TCF3) is a  potential downstream target of TERRA and mediates the effect of TERRA in mESC  maintenance. TERRA inhibits TCF3 transcription, while enforced TCF3 expression  abrogates the undifferentiated state of mESCs supported by TERRA. Accordingly,  the transcripts of the pluripotency genes Esrrb, Tfcp2l1, and Klf2, repressed by  TCF3 in mESCs, are increased in TERRA-overexpressing cells. Our study therefore  highlights the important role of TERRA in mESC maintenance and also uncovers a  mechanism by which TERRA promotes self-renewal. These data will expand our  understanding of the pluripotent regulatory network of ESCs., Context: self-renewal of mouse ESCs. Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as  the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signalling suggested Tcf3-β-catenin  activation of target genes would stimulate self-renewal, here we show that an  antagonistic relationship between Wnt3a and Tcf3 on gene expression regulates  ESC self-renewal. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 replaced the requirement for  exogenous Wnt3a or GSK3 inhibition for ESC self-renewal, demonstrating that  inhibition of Tcf3 repressor is the necessary downstream effect of Wnt  signalling. Interestingly, both Tcf3-β-catenin and Tcf1-β-catenin interactions  contributed to Wnt stimulation of self-renewal and gene expression, and the combination of Tcf3 and Tcf1 recruited Wnt-stabilized β-catenin to Oct4 binding  sites on ESC chromatin. This work elucidates the molecular link between the  effects of Wnt and the regulation of the Oct4/Sox2/Nanog network., Context:  BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are highly constrained elements of  mammalian genomes, whose functional role has not been completely elucidated yet.  Previous studies have shown that some of them act as enhancers in mouse, while some others are expressed in both normal and cancer-derived human tissues. Only  one UCE element so far was shown to present these two functions concomitantly,  as had been observed in other isolated instances of single, non ultraconserved enhancer elements. RESULTS: We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription  during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and  next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR, Context: An earlier search in the human, mouse and rat genomes for sequences that are  100% conserved in orthologous segments and > or = 200 bp in length identified  481 distinct sequences. These human-mouse-rat sequences, which represent  ultraconserved elements (UCEs), are believed to be important for functions  involving DNA binding, RNA processing and the regulation of transcription and  development. In vivo and additional computational studies of UCEs and other highly conserved sequences are consistent with these functional associations,  with some observations indicating enhancer-like activity for these elements.  Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental  duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating,  along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a  distinct subset.","29513567, 21685894, 20202189, 16998490","Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.

This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is because defects in these pathways can lead to replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material, and eventually cell death or car","Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,, Context: mismatch-repair function promotes cellular proliferation in the absence of  telomerase. Defects in mismatch repair, including mutations that correspond to  the same amino-acid changes recovered from HNPCC tumours, enhance  telomerase-independent survival in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a related  budding yeast with a degree of telomere sequence homology that is similar to  human telomeres. These results indicate that enhanced telomeric recombination in  human cells with mismatch-repair defects may contribute to cell immortalization  and hence tumorigenesis., Context:  Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology  directed or non-homologous repair pathways. Defects in components of DSB repair  pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer. The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer,  are involved in homology-directed DSB repair. Defects in another  homology-directed pathway, single-strand annealing, are associated with genome instability and cancer predisposition in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome and a  radiation-sensitive ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome. Many DSB repair  proteins also participate in the signaling pathways which underlie the cell's  response to DSBs.","12488587, 20298636, 11395777, 10753787",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki (Yorkie) are YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding","Context: Exploring the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration is one of the main  challenges in biology and biomedicine. Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The Drosophila compound eye is specified by the simultaneous and interdependent  activity of transcriptional regulatory genes from four families: PAX6 (eyeless,  twin of eyeless, eyegone), EYA (eyes absent), SIX (sine oculis, Optix) and DACH  (dachshund). Mammals have homologues of all these genes, and many of them are  expressed in the embryonic or adult eye, but the functional relationships  between them are currently much less clear than in Drosophila. Nevertheless, mutations in the mammalian genes highlight their requirement both within and  outside the eye in embryos and adults, and emphasize that they can be deployed  in many different contexts., Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals.

What is protein palmitoylation?,"Yes, protein palmitoylation is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester linkage","Context:  Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid  (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a  thioester linkage. Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation  site is conserved through most metazoan phlya.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about three indications for bupropion. These are:  1. As an antidepressant - this was the original indication for which bupropion was developed. 2. As a tobacco","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context:  The discovery that bupropion is an effective treatment for tobacco dependence  has triggered a rapid increase in development of potential new non-nicotine  pharmacotherapies, including bromocriptine, glucose, GTS-21, reboxetine, rimonabant, selegeline and varenicline. Successful new products will need to  have excellent side-effect profiles in addition to proven efficacy. New faster  delivery nicotine replacement products have the promise of addressing a broader list of indications, including treatment of nicotine withdrawal during temporary  abstinence and long-term nicotine maintenance. Nicotine vaccines will need to  demonstrate efficacy and also improve certain consumer acceptability, Context: self-administration. Current studies show that bupropion facilitates the  acquisition of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats, further suggesting  that bupropion enhances the rewarding properties of nicotine. Bupropion has been  shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials, bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile., Context: RESULTS: At therapeutic concentrations, hydroxylation of (S)-bupropion was  threefold and 1.5-greater than (R)-bupropion, respectively, by recombinant  CYP2B6 and human liver microsomes.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense.

Established protocols for experimental  detection and computational inference of CNVs from SNP array and next-generation  sequencing data are available. We present the CNVRanger R/Bioconductor package  which implements a comprehensive toolbox for structured downstream analysis of  CNVs. This includes functionality for summarizing individual CNV calls across a  population, assessing overlap with functional genomic regions, and genome-wide  association analysis with gene expression and quantitative phenotypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://bioconductor.org/packages/CNVRanger., Context: are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures. These packages  provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the  genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and  coverage vectors. Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for  overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range  operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other  Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential  expression analysis and visualization., Context: BACKGROUND: With the advancement in high-throughput technologies, researchers  can simultaneously investigate gene expression and copy number alteration (CNA)  data from individual patients at a lower cost. Traditional analysis methods  analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn  diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and  inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible  approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in  the same individual. RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple  input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two  real microarray datasets demonstrated that the CNA-driven genes identified by  the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a  genomic region with CNA. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC  package showed better performance.","23442169, 31392308, 23950696, 28088185","CNVRanger, seqCNA, iGC, PLRS, SomatiCA, Copynumber, crlmm, KC-SMARTR are all R/bioconductor packages for copy number analysis","21070656, 28088185, 24597965, 23419375, 24265680, 31392308, 23442169, 22523482"
What are the CADD scores?,The CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) scores are a measure of the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions in the human genome.,"Context: emergency departments who had received a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack.  Physicians completed data forms with the ABCD2 score before disposition. The  outcome criterion, stroke, was established by a treating neurologist or by an  Adjudication Committee. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity for  predicting stroke 7 and 90 days after visiting the emergency department using  the original ""high-risk"" cutpoint of an ABCD2 score of more than 5, and the  American Heart Association recommendation of a score of more than 2. RESULTS: We enrolled 2056 patients (mean age 68.0 yr, 1046 (50.9%) women) who  had a rate of stroke of 1.8% at 7 days and 3.2% at 90 days. An ABCD2 score of more than 5 had a sensitivity of 31.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-47.5)  for stroke at 7 days and 29.2% (95% CI 19.6-41.2) for stroke at 90 days. An  ABCD2 score of more than 2 resulted in sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 82.7-98.5) for stroke at 7 days with a specificity of 12.5% (95% CI 11.2-14.1).

For poor outcome (GOS = 2-3) the FOUR  score AUC was 0.683 (P = 0.018), the GCS AUC was 0.682 (P = 0.019). The FOUR  score value for favorable outcome (GOS = 4-5) was 0.748 (P = 0.001), the  corresponding GCS value was 0.704 (P = 0.002).

There was no relevant difference in predicting poor and good outcome., Context: Next-generation sequencing in clinical diagnostics is providing valuable genomic  variant data, which can be used to support healthcare decisions. In silico tools  to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have  evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its  classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA  mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from  InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do  predict pathogenicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.595, P < 0.001). However, we discovered  31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population  allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a  second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm  their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing  variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert  classification teams.","21646462, 30371827, 24013867, 25871441","Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders.

We recently demonstrated that halofuginone (HF), a widely studied  derivative of febrifugine, inhibits the development of T(H)17-driven  autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by activating the amino acid  response (AAR) pathway. Here we show that HF binds glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA  synthetase (EPRS), inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity; this inhibition  is reversed by the addition of exogenous proline or EPRS. We further show that  inhibition of EPRS underlies the broad bioactivities of this family of natural  product derivatives. This work both explains the molecular mechanism of a promising family of therapeutics and highlights the AAR pathway as an important  drug target for promoting inflammatory resolution., Context: CAR-T cell, lisocabtagene ciloleucel is currently being evaluated in large  clinical trials and may also be United States Food and Drug  Administration-approved soon.

With increasing use of CAR-T cells, the mechanism of  toxicities and mitigation strategies needs to be developed. Additionally,  reasons for CAR-T cell failure and progression following this therapy needs to  be further studied. We describe the recent developments in this field, with  emphasis on the complications of therapy and factors contributing to toxicities, efficacy, and resistance. We also describe the ongoing research in this field  and the newer CAR-T cell constructs that are being developed to counter the  challenges that have been identified in this field., Context: the pivotal phase I/II trials, emerging real-world evidence and ongoing trials. RECENT FINDINGS: For decades, attempts at improvement of the poor prognosis of  patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma with new treatment regimens have been  disappointing. Since the first report of CD19-directed CAR-T-cell therapy in  2010, three constructs have been tested in large phase I/II trials and resulted  in 30-40% durable responses. This has led to Food and Drug Administration and  European Medicines Agency approval for axicabtagene ciloleucel and  tisagenlecleucel and filing of the biologics license application for  lisocabtagene maraleucel. Emerging real-world evidence seems to confirm the promising results. However, considerable toxicity, mainly cytokine release  syndrome and neurotoxicity limits their general applicability and not all  patients intended to be treated can be bridged during the manufacturing period due to kinetics of the disease. Randomized phase III clinical trials are being  conducted to test anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy in the second-line and several  phase II trials are aiming to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity., Context: CAR T-cells have transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with  relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Currently, three CAR T-cell  products are approved or soon to be approved: axicabtagene ciloleucel,  tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel. These products differ in  construct, manufacturing, clinical trial design and toxicity profile. Patient  selection for CAR T-cells, and the ideal product for a given patient, involves myriad considerations including age, fitness, prior therapies, comorbid  diseases, organ function, logistics of administration, turnaround time, and  institutional familiarity.

Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms. We compared the results of the different methods by  applying five different performance measurement metrices.

Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding  that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for  cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell  lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response, Context: Objective responses included medulloblastoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms,  rhabdoid and Ewing sarcoma xenografts. For the ALL panel, there was one partial  response, five complete responses and one maintained complete response. The ALL  xenografts expressed the highest levels of p53 among the PPTP panels. CONCLUSIONS: RG7112 induced tumor regressions in solid tumors from different  histotype panels, and exhibited consistent high-level activity against ALL  xenografts. This high level of activity supports prioritization of RG7112 for  further evaluation.","22015969, 30194269, 23400593, 22753001",BFKB8488A is a bispecific antibody against FGFR1 and KLB.,33139537

While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat.

Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed., Context:  Coronavirus (CoV) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and  enteric disease in humans and animals. In 2012, a new human disease called  Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical  Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the  death of the infected individuals.

These samples included cases from three  nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes  and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other  available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological  data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged  independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory  samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same  geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from  corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these  clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.","25791336, 28616501, 30146782, 29239118",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not mention any resource that has been developed to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. The context only discusses the role of GRG5 in stem cell fate decisions and T-cell fate","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, according to the context, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. They are formed under certain stress conditions and can contain mutant-FUS proteins. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the  Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required  for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of  Zα(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding  protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We  additionally show that the Zα domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1,  E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we  show that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization.

Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context:  A novel antihypertensive drug, LCZ696 (Entresto®), has recently been introduced,  which combines the action of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (RAAS), effectively decreasing the blood pressure, with an inhibition of neprilysin, which is responsible for metabolizing natriuretic peptides exerting  antihypertensive and antifibrotic effects. In this MiniReview, we describe the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy and side effects of the combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696. We summarize  the effect of LCZ696 treatment of patients suffering from hypertension and heart  failure (HF) and further highlight the role of this new drug as a treatment, Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides.

At present, however, genetic testing of CREBBP is not commonly  applied in clinical settings because the currently available assays are technically and financially demanding, mainly because of the size of the gene.  In the present study, we took advantage of a highly sensitive and specific,  automated denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique. First, we developed a DHPLC-based protocol to analyze the entire coding region  of CREBBP. Second, we analyzed genetic samples from 21 RSTS patients using  DHPLC.

Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context:  The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+), Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line.","22383310, 22850463, 26342684, 24205431",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"

These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics.","11842483, 30710642, 22001260, 22001260",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, the context provides information about the organs affected by SLE. The text mentions that SLE is a systemic disease with multiple organ involvement and it can affect the central and peripheral nervous system, skin, and cardiac systems.","Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune  connective-tissue disease involving multiple organs and systems. Some evidence  has demonstrated that disease activity could be associated with increased risk  of organ damage. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association between  systemic lupus erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores and  subclinical cardiac involvement. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 45 SLE patients (88%  female; mean age: 31.2 ± 8.2 years) from 2011 to 2013 in Mashhad, Iran. The  patients had no clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac problems or risk factors, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune  connective-tissue disease involving multiple organs and systems.
