HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.661,[0.708 0.662 0.585 0.719 0.732 0.728],[0.742 0.536 0.522 0.597 0.654 0.656],0.649

Mitochondria are susceptible  to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Calcium (Ca2+) handling proteins are known to play a pivotal role in  the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy. However little is known about early  changes in the diabetic heart and the impact of insulin treatment (Ins). ,  Context: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and ,  Context: that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. ,  Context: oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause  cardiac dysfunction.
