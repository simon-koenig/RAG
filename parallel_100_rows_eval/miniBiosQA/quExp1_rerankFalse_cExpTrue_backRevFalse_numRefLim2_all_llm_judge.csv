In vivo  diagnosis can be established with prenatal brain imaging and disease severity  correlates with extent of abnormally developed brain tissue. Advances in  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the past 25 years and their application to  the fetus have enabled diagnosis of holoprosencephaly in utero.

Using an  advanced MRI protocol and a 1.5-Tesla magnet, we show radiographic data diagnostic for the holoprosencephaly spectrum, including alobar, semilobar,  lobar, middle interhemispheric, and septopreoptic variant. Accurate prenatal  evaluation is important because the severity of imaging findings correlates with postnatal morbidity and mortality in holoprosencephaly. Therefore, this work has  implications for the evaluation, diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling  that families can receive during a pregnancy.  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly is a spectrum of congenital defects of forebrain development  characterized by incomplete separation of the cerebral hemispheres. In vivo  diagnosis can be established with prenatal brain imaging and disease severity  correlates with extent of abnormally developed brain tissue. Advances in  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the past 25 years and their application to  the fetus have enabled diagnosis of holoprosencephaly in utero. Here, we report  on the prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly using MRI as part of a diagnostic  and management evaluation at a tertiary and quaternary referral center. Using an  advanced MRI protocol and a 1.5-Tesla magnet, we show radiographic data diagnostic for the holoprosencephaly spectrum, including alobar, semilobar,  lobar, middle interhemispheric, and septopreoptic variant.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,I am uncertain about what Pseudomelanosis duodeni is.," Context: BACKGROUND: Propofol is a short-acting, intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent that  is widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and  sedation. An uncommon adverse effect of propofol is green discoloration of the  urine, which has been reported not only under general anesthesia but also with  sedation. Although it is assumed that the phenolic derivatives of propofol can  cause green discoloration of the urine, the actual origin remains unknown. The  aim of this report was to identify the origin of the green discoloration of the  urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). CLINICAL FEATURES: The patient, a 51-year-old man, was scheduled for his oral surgery under general anesthesia using propofol. Postoperatively, the color of  his urine was observed to be green. We compared and analyzed both the green  urine and the normal urine using LC-MS. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of a patient with green discoloration of the  urine after general anesthesia using propofol. Although LC-MS analysis showed 2  unique peaks in the green urine at 490 and 590 nm, obvious causes were not  revealed.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Propofol is a short-acting, intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent that  is widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and  sedation.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor  ","19884656, 19884656","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.0,[0. 0.],[1. 1.],0.0

We propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing p300","20599721, 19961954",1.0,[0. 0.],[0. 0.],1.0
