What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation plays a role in Group 3 and 4 medulloblastomas, as evidenced by frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases and higher levels of trim"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors.

Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ","23179372, 23179372, 23179372, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",1.0,[1. 1. 1. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 0.],0.0

When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context:  Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS.  ,  Context: Synucleinopathies comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative proteinopathies  that share common pathological lesions composed of aggregates of conformational  and posttranslational modifications of alpha-synuclein in selected populations  of neurons and glia.

Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep typically reduces genetic diversity around the adaptive site. However, it can also quickly carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele, resulting in novel haplotype variation"," Context: Antagonistic host-parasite interactions can drive rapid adaptive evolution in  genes of the immune system, and such arms races may be an important force  shaping polymorphism in the genome. The RNA interference pathway gene  Argonaute-2 (AGO2) is a key component of antiviral defense in Drosophila, and we  have previously shown that genes in this pathway experience unusually high rates  of adaptive substitution. Here we study patterns of genetic variation in a 100-kbp region around AGO2 in three different species of Drosophila. Our data  suggest that recent independent selective sweeps in AGO2 have reduced genetic  variation across a region of more than 50 kbp in Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, and we estimate that selection has fixed adaptive  substitutions in this gene every 30-100 thousand years. The strongest signal of  recent selection is evident in D. simulans, where we estimate that the most  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and  ,  Context: Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic  diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early  in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the  ,  Context: more generally reflect a less specific process related to the many intra- and  inter-molecular interactions compatible with a range of more or less equally  viable protein conformations. These interactions will lead to different  constraints on the nature of the primary sequences, consistently with theories  suggesting the non-independence of substitutions in proteins. However, a  specific type of amino acid variation might constitute a good indicator of  functional divergence: substitutions occurring at positions that are generally  slowly evolving. Such substitutions at constrained sites are indeed much more  frequent soon after gene duplication. The identification and analysis of these sites by complementing structural information with evolutionary data may  represent a promising direction to future studies dealing with the functional  characterization of an ever increasing number of multi-gene families identified by complete genome analysis.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails.

One of the most important such  Ca2+ regulated processes is transcription. A body of literature describes the  effect of Ca2+ signaling on transcription initiation as occurring mainly through  activation of gene-specific transcription factors by Ca2+-induced signaling  cascades. However, the reach of Ca2+ extends far beyond the first step of transcription. In fact, Ca2+ can regulate all phases of transcription, with  additional effects on transcription-associated events such as alternative  splicing. Importantly, Ca2+ signaling mediates reduced transcription termination in response to certain stress conditions. This reduction allows readthrough  transcription, generating a highly inducible and diverse class of downstream of  gene containing transcripts (DoGs) that we have recently described.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"I am uncertain about what a Hemophilic Pseudotumor is, as there is no mention of it in the provided context."," Context: however, only nine (1.8%) had polyneuropathy with objective clinical signs and  abnormal electrophysiological findings. The neuropathy was axonal in all, in  five pure sensory and in four sensorimotor. The patients with peripheral  neuropathy had extraglandular manifestations such as palpable purpura and  vasculitis. No evidence of antineural autoimmunity was found, and no candidate  biomarkers were identified.  CONCLUSION: Polyneuropathy is a rare manifestation of pSS occurring in 1.8% of  patients. In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently  associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development.  ,  Context: (13%) simultaneously had micro/anophthalmia, oral clefts and polydactyly. Some  findings were only observed in our sample and included, among others,  preauricular tags (10%), duplication of the hallux (3%) and spots following the  lines of Blaschko (3%). Mosaicism (20% of cases) had a statistically significant  association only with absence of cryptorchidism. The median of survival was 26  days. Patients with and without mosaicism had similar median of survival.

Other frequent  clinical findings are vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anemia and/or serositis.  Primary adrenal insufficiency in these patients affects the adrenal cortex,  which is destroyed by autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. Unlike other causes  of adrenal insufficiency (infectious diseases, infiltrative diseases, bleeding,  tumors), the adrenal medulla is not involved. Pheochromocytomas are tumors  arising from the chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system in the  adrenal medulla. The clinical symptoms of these tumors vary from isolated hypertension or hypertension accompanied by paroxysmal episodes -including the  classical triad of headache, palpitations and diaphoresis-to potentially serious  manifestations such as acute pulmonary edema, arrhythmias and sudden death. Nevertheless, up to 40% of affected patients are asymptomatic. We present the  case of a patient diagnosed with APS-II who developed a pheochromocytoma. In  this patient, the adrenal gland cortex was atrophied and the tumor was attached  ,  Context: obtained from all participants; in 18, the information was corroborated by  detailed clinical examination.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are used in various fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology for ultrafast studies. They are also used at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to produce high-intensity"," Context:  The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  ,  Context: (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been  investigated. An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray  interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for  applications. Here we report the experimental creation of a solid-density plasma  at temperatures in excess of 10(6) kelvin on inertial-confinement timescales  using an X-ray free-electron laser. We discuss the pertinent physics of the  intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a  radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental  results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the timescales of  collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray  experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context:  X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially  coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. A diffraction focusing spectrometer (DFS),  which is able to measure the whole energy spectrum of the radiation of a single XFEL pulse with an energy resolution of ΔE/E 2 × 10(-6), is proposed. This is  much better than for most modern X-ray spectrometers. Such resolution allows one  to resolve the fine spectral structure of the XFEL pulse. The effect of diffraction focusing occurs in a single-crystal plate due to dynamical  scattering, and is similar to focusing in a Pendry lens made from a metamaterial  with a negative refraction index.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,I am uncertain about what Pseudomelanosis duodeni is.," Context:  In about 70% of patients Crohn's disease (CD) affects the small intestine. This  disease location is stable over time and associated with a genetic background  different from isolated colonic disease. A characteristic feature of small intestinal host defense is the presence of Paneth cells at the bottom of the  crypts of Lieberkühn. These cells produce different broad spectrum antimicrobial  peptides (AMPs) most abundantly the α-defensins HD-5 and -6 (DEFA5 und DEFA6). In small intestinal Crohn's disease both these PC products are specifically  reduced. As a functional consequence, ileal extracts from Crohn's disease  patients are compromised in clearing bacteria and enteroadherent E. coli  ,  Context: the uptake of prions from the lumen of the small intestine. To test this  hypothesis, transgenic mice were created in which deficiency in PrPC was  specifically restricted to epithelial cells throughout the lining of the small  intestine. Our data clearly show that efficient prion neuroinvasion after oral  exposure occurred independently of PrPC expression in small intestinal  epithelial cells. The specific absence of PrPC in the gut epithelium did not  influence the early replication of prions in Peyer's patches or disease  susceptibility. Acute mucosal inflammation can enhance PrPC expression in the  intestine, implying the potential to enhance oral prion disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. However, our data suggest that the magnitude of PrPC expression  in the epithelium lining the small intestine is unlikely to be an important  factor which influences the risk of oral prion disease susceptibility.IMPORTANCE The accumulation of orally acquired prions within Peyer's patches in the small  intestine is essential for the efficient spread of disease to the brain. Little  is known of how the prions initially establish infection within Peyer's patches.  ,  Context: downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activity and subsequent inflammation.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,Enasidenib (Idhifa) and ivosidenib (Tibsovo) are the IDH inhibitors developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Enasidenib was approved on," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  ,  Context:  In August 2017, the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved  enasidenib (Idhifa, Celgene/Agios) for adults with relapsed and refractory acute  myelogenous leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation. Enasidenib targets cells with mutant copies of isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), inhibiting the  oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarte (2-HG) formed by the mutant IDH2. Areas  covered: We review the studies leading to enasidenib's approval, as well as common side effects and safety issues experienced during the clinical trials.  There is a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of these side effects including  differentiation syndrome. Expert commentary: We are experiencing a revolution in  ,  Context:  Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®) is a small molecule, orally available inhibitor of mutated  cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that is being developed by Agios  Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer in patients with IDH1 mutations. The mutated form of the IDH1 enzyme produces a metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), which is thought to play a role in the formation and progression of  acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gliomas and other cancers. Elevated 2-HG levels interfere with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, thereby  contributing to oncogenesis. Ivosidenib targets the IDH1 metabolic pathway to  prevent a build-up of the oncometabolite 2-HG. This article summarizes the  ,  Context: polymerase-chain-reaction assay. No preexisting co-occurring single gene  mutation predicted clinical response or resistance to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML,  ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of  grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion  independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with  complete remission.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), as some patients with NCCM also have DCM. In fact, 30-40% of cases of DCM"," Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984. This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM). BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype. In  addition, INLVM with a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle, ventricular  dysfunction, and deep trabeculations, is also inherited, and the genes  ,  Context: end-diastolic diameter was 66 ± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 ±  10%>.

Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in  regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.

Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  ,  Context:  Aberrant chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor CXCR4 expressions in malignant tissues  have been reported, but its role in gastric cancer prognosis remains unknown.  Our studies were designed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of CXCR4 in patients with gastric cancer. CXCR4 expression was  retrospectively analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 97 patients with gastric  adenocarcinoma from China. Results were assessed for association with clinical features and overall survival by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"I am uncertain about the aim of iodine prophylaxis as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, I can tell you that one of the contexts mentions ""the global improvement of iodine nutrition"" and another context discusses the effects"," Context: Thirty years of clinical trials have demonstrated that stroke can be prevented  by reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg or by a further decrease of  10/5 mm Hg when blood pressure is controlled, by reducing LDL cholesterol by at  least 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl), and by inhibiting platelet aggregation. The (too  simplistic) concept of the polypill strategy combining pharmacologic agents to  achieve these goals is supposed to reduce the risk by 80% overall. However,  reducing general salt and sugar intake, giving up smoking, developing prevention  clinics with prevention nurses to improve adherence to preventive treatments, as  well as decreasing poverty and malnutrition, increasing the level of hygiene, fighting against infectious diseases and financially helping developing  countries are all combined necessary approaches to decrease the worldwide burden  of stroke and other vascular diseases.  ,  Context: diagnosing iron overload are available, there are still questions about options  for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and duration of  treatment.

The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts  to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and  to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the  role of public health in this field. The two main topics were the research  priorities of the field, including clinical, genetic, and public health issues, and the concerns about the validity of current screening recommendations for the  condition.  ,  Context: Medical ethics generally applies to individual interactions between physicians  and patients. Conversely, public health ethics typically applies to interactions  between an agency or institution and a community or population. Four main  principles underlie medical ethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and  justice. By contrast, public health ethical principles address issues such as  interdependence, community trust, fundamentality, and justice. In large part because of the significant community-level effects of public health issues,  medical ethics are suboptimal for assessing community-level public health  interventions or plans-especially in the area of emergency preparedness. To be effective, as well as ethical, public health preparedness efforts must address  all of the core principles of public health ethics.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: With the global improvement of iodine nutrition, iodine excess is  emerging as a new concern.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: G-quadruplexes (G4s) are higher-order structures formed by guanine-rich  sequences of nucleic acids, such as the telomeric 5'-TTAGGG-3'/5'-UUAGGG-3'  repeats and those in gene regulatory regions. G4s regulate various biological  events, including replication, transcription, and translation. Imbalanced G4  dynamics is associated with diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative  diseases. Telomestatin is a natural macrocyclic compound derived from Streptomyces anulatus 3533-SV4. It interacts with the guanine quartet via π-π  stacking and potently stabilizes G4. Because G4 stabilization at the telomeric  repeat inhibits the telomere-synthesizing enzyme telomerase, telomestatin was originally identified as a telomerase inhibitor. Whereas non-toxic doses of  telomestatin induce gradual shortening of telomeres and eventual crisis in human  cancer cells, higher doses trigger prompt replication stress and DNA damage  ,  Context: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first enzyme of the pentose  phosphate pathway.

Most G6PD deficient individuals show no clinical abnormality under normal conditions, but acute hemolytic crisis may  occur. Several nonhemolytic abnormalities occur as well in G6PD deficients at a  higher frequency than in nondeficients.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat uterine fibroids (UF) in women and endometriosis-associated pain. Additionally, it is also used to achieve and maintain castration in intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing primary external beam"," Context: AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy  menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Relugolix is a promising drug for the non-surgical treatment of women with UF. To date, the only published data come from a well-selected  Japanese female population study while results from worldwide ongoing studies  are ongoing in order to confirm the efficacy of this GnRH agonist receptor.  ,  Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group.

The proband presented with bilateral complete corneal  opacification and dyskeratosis. Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and laryngeal  dyskeratosis were associated with the phenotype. Histopathology studies of  cornea and vocal cord biopsies showed dyskeratotic keratinisation. Quantitative  PCR ruled out 4q35 duplication, classically described in HBID cases. Next  generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and  whole exome capture processing was performed. Sequence reads were aligned, and  screened for single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion calls. In-house pipeline filtering analyses and comparisons with available databases were  performed. A novel missense mutation M77T was discovered for the gene NLRP1  which maps to chromosome 17p13.2. This was a de novo mutation in the proband's mother, following segregation in the family, and not found in 738 control DNA  samples. NLRP1 expression was determined in adult corneal epithelium.

Here we  present the first report that enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) families of drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed and active in vaginal and colorectal tissue using biopsies collected  from healthy volunteers. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and  maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are  differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Taken  together, these data should help to guide the optimization of small molecules  being developed for HIV PrEP.  ,  Context: The use of medicinal plants concomitantly with conventional drugs can result in  herb-drug interactions that cause fluctuations in drug bioavailability and  consequent therapeutic failure and/or toxic effects.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,The genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions.," Context: Chromatin has a complex spatial organization in the cell nucleus that serves  vital functional purposes. A variety of chromatin folding conformations has been  detected by single-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture-based  approaches. However, a unified quantitative framework describing spatial  chromatin organization is still lacking. Here, we explore the ""strings and  binders switch"" model to explain the origin and variety of chromatin behaviors that coexist and dynamically change within living cells. This simple polymer  model recapitulates the scaling properties of chromatin folding reported  experimentally in different cellular systems, the fractal state of chromatin, the processes of domain formation, and looping out. Additionally, the strings  and binders switch model reproduces the recently proposed ""fractal-globule""  model, but only as one of many possible transient conformations.  ,  Context:  The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome.  Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an  important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture  of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem  cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data  with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a  determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions  ,  Context: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatinization of the mat2/mat3 loci silences  the mating-type information encoded within these loci. Here, we present the  solution structure of the chromo domain from the cryptic loci regulator protein  Clr4. Clr4 is known to regulate silencing and switching at the mating-type loci  and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres. Clr4 and its human and  Drosophila homologs have been identified as histone H3-specific  methyltransferases, further implicating this family of proteins in chromatin  remodeling. Our structure highlights a conserved surface that may be involved in  chromo domain-ligand interactions. We have also analyzed two chromo domain mutants (W31G and W41G) that previously were shown to affect silencing and  switching in full-length Clr4. Both mutants are significantly destabilized  relative to wild-type.  ,  Context: of binding sites recognized by regulators such as transcriptions factors (TFs)  and microRNAs (miRNAs), our understanding of this regulatory code and its  context-dependent read-out remains very limited. Given that there are thousands  of potential regulators in mammals, it is not practical to use direct  experimentation to identify which of these play a key role for a particular  system of interest. We developed a methodology that models gene expression or  chromatin modifications in terms of genome-wide predictions of regulatory sites  and completely automated it into a web-based tool called ISMARA (Integrated  System for Motif Activity Response Analysis). Given only gene expression or chromatin state data across a set of samples as input, ISMARA identifies the key  TFs and miRNAs driving expression/chromatin changes and makes detailed  predictions regarding their regulatory roles.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,TADCompare and SpectralTAD are two R packages that have been developed for studying topologically associated domains (TADs).," Context:  Recent research using chromatin conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C,  has demonstrated the importance of topologically associated domains (TADs) and  smaller chromatin loops, collectively referred hereafter as ""interacting domains."" Many such domains change during development or disease, and exhibit  cell- and condition-specific differences. Quantification of the dynamic behavior  of interacting domains will help to better understand genome regulation. Methods for comparing interacting domains between cells and conditions are highly  limited. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of  boundaries of interacting domains between two or more Hi-C datasets. TADCompare  ,  Context: The combinatorial action of transcription factors drives cell-type-specific gene  expression patterns. However, transcription factor binding and gene regulation  occur in the context of chromatin, which modulates DNA accessibility.  High-resolution chromatin interaction maps have defined units of chromatin that  are in spatial proximity, called topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs  can be further classified based on expression activity, replication timing, or the histone marks or non-histone proteins associated with them. Independently,  other chromatin domains have been defined by their likelihood to interact with  non-DNA structures, such as the nuclear lamina. Lamina-associated domains (LADs) correlate with low gene expression and late replication timing. TADs and LADs  have recently been evaluated with respect to cell-type-specific gene expression.  The results shed light on the relevance of these forms of chromatin organization  ,  Context: between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in  genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of  three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced  as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.  Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse  genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at  unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin  interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive  structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains  are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species,  indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are  enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer  RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial  role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies  (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of  topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,Abiraterone is a potent inhibitor (IC50 4 nM for hydroxylase) of human cytochrome P45017alpha.," Context:  Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system  that disrupts signals within the brain and also the signals between the brain  and body, will likely experience symptoms that may negatively impact their quality of life (QOL). Due to the complexity of MS and its disease burden,  multidisciplinary management that combines pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic  strategies with patient education is necessary. Diagnosing relapses of MS in clinical practice can be difficult due to the multiple subtypes of MS,  variations of symptomatology, and pseudo-relapses. Managing relapses also  presents its own set of challenges, for example, evaluating if treatment is  ,  Context:  Abiraterone (17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol, 1) is a potent inhibitor  (IC50 4 nM for hydroxylase) of human cytochrome P45017alpha. To assist in  studies of the role of the 16,17-double bond in its mechanism of action, the novel 17alpha-(4-pyridyl)androst-5-en-3beta-ol (5) and  17beta-(3-pyridyl)-16,17alpha-epoxy-5alpha-androst-3beta-ol (6) were  synthesized. 3beta-Acetoxyetienic acid was converted in three steps into 5 via photolysis of the thiohydroxamic ester 8.

CONCLUSIONS: In a population of independently living elderly men, higher FT4 and  rT3 concentrations are associated with a lower physical function. High serum rT3  may result from a decreased peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones due to the  aging process itself and/or disease and may reflect a catabolic state.

Int. Genet. 4:323  and Walsh et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 5:170). Each study arrived at  different recommendations for eye color predictive tests aiming to type the most  closely associated SNPs, although both confirmed rs12913832 in HERC2 as the key  predictor, widely recognized as the most strongly associated marker with blue  and brown iris colors. Differences between these two studies in identification  of other eye color predictors may partly arise from varying approaches to  assigning phenotypes, notably those not unequivocally blue or dark brown and therefore occupying an intermediate iris color continuum. We have developed two  single base extension assays typing 37 SNPs in pigmentation-associated genes to  study SNP-genotype based prediction of eye, skin, and hair color variation. These assays were used to test the performance of different sets of eye color  predictors in 416 subjects from six populations of north and south Europe.

Changes in skin, hair,  and ocular pigment were followed as the patients matured. As a measure of ocular  pigment, iris transillumination and macular transparency were graded according  to a previously published scheme. RESULTS: Patients were born with white scalp hair and skin, and nystagmus  developed. Visual acuity was reduced to 20/50 to 20/200 for the group, but in  one patient vision improved with maturity. Irides were blue. In seven patients,  iris pigment developed, which was detected by transillumination with slit-lamp  biomicroscopy, including the one patient with improved visual acuity. All patients had foveal hypoplasia, and melanin pigment in the fundi could not be  detected by clinical examination. Visual acuity in the group did not correlate  directly with the presence or development of iris transillumination or macular transparency. The pedigrees were consistent with an autosomal recessive  inheritance pattern. CONCLUSION: This unique type of oculocutaneous albinism has heterogeneous  clinical features. Minimal pigment oculocutaneous albinism appears to represent  ,  Context: used to control neovascularization and inflammation in eye with significant  positive results whereas others have been used to target CD20, CD52, CD11a, and  IL-2. The growing interest in these drugs with current progress in biotechnology  and genetic engineering has kindled active research and with more understanding  of the molecular basis of many ocular disorders these antibodies are being  explored in a variety of different pathological conditions of the eye. Various  sight threatening serious eye disorders which are resistant to the conventional  available therapy have responded favorably to these drugs. Despite the  limitations of high cost and uncertainty around long term safety profile, rational use of the monoclonal antibodies holds immense promise in management of  various ocular conditions.  ,  Context: been described between non-truncating mutations of its basic domain and Tietz  syndrome, which is characterized by albinoid-like hypopigmentation of the skin  and hair, rather than the patchy depigmentation seen in Waardenburg syndrome,  and severe hearing loss.

We observed a wide range of phenotypes and some unexpected features. All  the patients had blue irides and pigmentation abnormalities that ranged from  diffuse hypopigmentation to Waardenburg-like patches. In addition, they showed  congenital complete hearing loss, diffuse hypopigmentation of the skin, freckling and ocular abnormalities, more frequently than patients with MITF  mutations outside the basic domain. In conclusion, the non-truncating mutations  of the basic domain do not always lead to Tietz syndrome but rather to a large range of phenotypes.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters and plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development. It localizes at super enhancers, which regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes, and interacts with chromatin modifiers and"," Context:  Cohesin, a critical mediator of genome organization including sister chromatid  cohesion, is a ring-shaped multi-subunit ATPase that topologically embraces DNA.  Its loading and function on chromosomes require the Scc2-Scc4 loader. Using biochemical reconstitution, we show here that the ability of the loader to bind  DNA plays a critical role in promoting cohesin loading. Two distinct sites  within the Mis4Scc2 subunit are found to cooperatively bind DNA. Mis4Scc2 initially forms a tertiary complex with cohesin on DNA and promotes subsequent  topological DNA entrapment by cohesin through its DNA binding activity, a  process that requires an additional DNA binding surface provided by Psm3Smc3,  ,  Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"No, according to the provided information, colistin is a membrane-acting agent, not classified as an antibiotic."," Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin).
