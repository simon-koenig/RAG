What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in human diseases. Unlike genetic  mutations, however, they do not change the underlying DNA sequences. Epigenetic  phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with  many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the  methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput  screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a  miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for  methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it  ","19270706, 14688019, 23179372, 23557020","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",0.0,[1. 0. 1. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 1.],0.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"STAG1 and STAG2 proteins are core components of cohesin and have partially overlapping functions. They are involved in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis, with STAG2 being replaced by STAG3 in germinal cell-specific co"," Context: alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.  We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement  of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin  complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.  ,  Context:  T-STAG (tissue-specific transcripts and genes) is a resource and web-interface,  designated to analyze tissue/tumor-specific expression patterns in human and  mouse transcriptomes. It integrates our refined prediction of specific expression patterns both in genes as well as in individual isoforms with  man-mouse orthology data. In combination with the features for  combining/contrasting the genes expressed in different tissues, T-STAG implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of  differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with  significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"For astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme), hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.03-1.7 was found for >10 year latency period. In"," Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational  radiation exposure among medical radiation workers. METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the  lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were  enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses  were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of  radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study  population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for  calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk  (LFR). RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation  exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was  observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher  risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower  radiation doses than male workers.

Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2.29,  95% CI=1.56-3.37. The results for meningioma were OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.31-4.98 and  OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.81-2.23, respectively. Regarding acoustic neuroma ipsilateral  mobile phone use in the latency group ≥10 years gave OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.73-4.45.  For ipsilateral cumulative use ≥1640h OR=2.55, 95% CI=1.50-4.40 was obtained.

This increased HR was  based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme).  Decreased HR was found for low-grade astrocytoma, WHO grades I-II, which might be caused by RF-EMF exposure leading to tumour-associated symptoms and earlier  detection and surgery with better prognosis.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent, meaning it can be applied to any organism. It has been tested on the fly genome as a case study, and its web-server is available at http://nplb"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone also at https://github.com/computationalBiology/NPLB/ (Mac OSX/Linux). CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: DNase I footprint analysis of this gel shift complex showed an extended  footprint over both the Sp1 and the Ets1 binding site, demonstrating that Sp1  and Ets1 form a ternary complex with the PTHrP DNA. Cotransfection of an Ets1  and Sp1 expression vector into Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that Sp1  can functionally cooperate with Ets1 to transactivate the PTHrP promoter. We  conclude from these data that Ets1 and Sp1 can cooperatively regulate PTHrP P2  promoter activity.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks. The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay also uses fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor"," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is  Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is  the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor  tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using pre-determined performance criteria, which is a critical component of molecular  diagnostic test validation. RESULTS: All analytical measurements met pre-specified performance criteria. PCR  ,  Context: Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of  genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions.

Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease (LBD) is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy that is characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies in the central and sympathetic nervous systems.," Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.

Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85).

Edible species and body tissues of pufferfish, as well as their allowable fishing areas, are therefore clearly stipulated in Japan, but  still 2 to 3 people die every year due to pufferfish poisoning. TTX is  originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria. Pufferfish become nontoxic when  fed TTX-free diets in a closed environment in which there is no possible  invasion of TTX-bearing organisms.

Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context: local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA  sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts  the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial  mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population,  which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are  distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be  delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking  effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on  genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in  subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high  migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  ,  Context:  A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962  explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different  bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell  death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin  sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy.

Anticancer drug-induced autophagy induction is poorly characterized in  osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on camptothecin (CPT)-induced cytotoxicity in OS. METHODS: Autophagy-inhibited DLM8 and K7M3 metastatic murine OS cell lines were  generated by infection with lentiviral shRNA directed against the essential autophagy protein ATG5. Knockdown of ATG5 protein expression and inhibition of  autophagy was confirmed by immunoblot of ATG5 and LC3II proteins, respectively.  Metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay and cell viability was determined  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests  that impairment of lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in  alpha-synuclein clearance might play an important role. For this reason, we  sought to examine the expression levels of members of the autophagy pathway in brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in alpha-synuclein  transgenic mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By immunoblot analysis, compared to controls and AD, in DLB cases levels of mTor were elevated and Atg7 were reduced.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails.

However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes."," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation.

Invading viral pathogens that depend upon the host cell's  transcriptional apparatus are also subject to the regulatory impact of chromatin  assembly and modifications. Here we show that infection by the  alpha-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), results in the rapid accumulation of chromatin bearing repressive histone  H3 Lys9 methylation. To enable expression of viral immediate early (IE) genes,  both viruses use the cellular transcriptional coactivator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) to recruit the lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) to the viral  immediate early promoters. Depletion of LSD1 or inhibition of its activity with  monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) results in the accumulation of repressive  ,  Context: site. After induction, the association of these proteins with the  promoter-proximal region continues whereas RNAPII and DSIF are also found in the  downstream regions. Depletion of a subunit of NELF by RNA interference enhances  the junB mRNA level both before and after induction, indicating that DSIF- and  NELF-mediated pausing contributes to the negative regulation of junB expression,  not only by inducing RNAPII pausing before induction but also by attenuating  transcription after induction. These regulatory mechanisms appear to be  conserved in other immediate-early genes as well.  ,  Context:  Transcription of eukaryotic genes by RNA polymerase II (pol II) is a complex,  highly regulated multiphasic process. Pol II pauses in the proximity of the  promoter on a large fraction of transcribed genes. Transcription initiation and elongation of transcripts are under distinct control. Induced gene expression  can thus be due to enhanced initiation and/or stimulated elongation. Pausing and  resumption of the elongation of transcripts is under the control of transcription elongation factors. Three of them, P-TEFb, DSIF, and NELF have  been well characterized as protein complexes with multiple general but also gene  specific functions.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication that occurs in patients with severe hemophilia, resulting from multiple episodes of bleeding into bones and soft tissues. It appears as a painless tumor of slow growth that can compress vital organs, producing bone"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication that occurs in  patients with severe hemophilia. Results from multiple episodes of bleeding into  the bones and soft tissues.  PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 31 years old male patient, with severe hemophilia A.  Diagnosed with an abdominal tumor 10 years ago during routine screening, that  progressively grew to encompass the entire abdominal area, with symptoms of  intestinal obstruction. DISCUSSION: Hemophilic pseudotumor appears as a painless tumor of slow growth  that can compress vital organs producing bone destruction, muscle and skin  necrosis. The tumor may have fistulas or break spontaneously. CONCLUSION: The abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare pathological entity,  with few reports worldwide, but must be considered in hemophilic patients with a  well documented abdominal tumor.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare, but well-known, complication of hemophilia. We  describe a 50-year-old man with mild hemophilia A, but with no previous need for  Factor VIII supplementation, who presented with a pathologic fracture of the right femoral neck and shaft caused by a large hemophilic pseudotumor. Initial  nonoperative therapy with factor replacement and skeletal traction resulted in  radiographic evidence of fracture healing, but the patient's pain persisted. Therefore, he had a radical resection of his hemophilic pseudotumor (soft tissue  component and entire femur), and reconstruction with a custom total femoral  replacement. Six months after resection, the patient returned to full-time  ,  Context: MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with 39 HP were treated. All  patients had haemophilia A. Twenty-four patients had no inhibitors (72.8%), and  9 had inhibitors (27.2%). The mean follow-up was 16 years (1-25). All patients  had x-rays and MRIs. All of them received Buenos Aires protocol as conservative  treatment for 6 weeks. MRIs were repeated after 6 weeks' treatment to assess  response to treatment. Surgery was performed in patients who did not respond to  conservative treatment. RESULTS: After Buenos Aires protocol, four pseudotumours did not shrink  (10.24%), 33 (84.61%) shrank, and two (5.12%) healed. Thirty-seven pseudotumours had surgery, 35 pseudotumours (94.59%) healed with minimally invasive treatment,  and two did not heal (5.41%). No infection was observed with this treatment. The  mortality rate for the series was 0%. CONCLUSION: The minimally invasive treatment of pseudotumours was effective in  95% of the cases and resulted in no mortality in this series after 28 years.  ,  Context: Hemophilic pseudotumor gradually erodes bone and induces fracture or deformity,  causing joint dysfunction or destructive osteoarthropathy. Reports about surgery  for hemophilic pseudotumor complicated by destructive osteoarthropathy are  scarce. The object of this study was to evaluate the results and complications  of surgical management for patients of pseudotumor complicated by destructive  osteoarthropathy. We retrospectively reviewed records from July 1996 to July 2013, and found eight patients with pseudotumor complicated by destructive  osteoarthropathy. We recorded their demographic data, time of surgery, amount of  blood loss and transfusion, bone union, and complications. Seven patients were diagnosed with hemophilia A and one with hemophilia B. The mean age at surgery  was 31.9 ± 8.3 years.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.

METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor. mTORC1 drives HIF-1α synthesis through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of"," Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling  critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Gait disturbance, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence."," Context: The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology  characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial  paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The  orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen,  nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is  indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to  one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence  assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete  form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis  granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably  present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.

Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes a clinical triad consisting of periodic  paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and usually mild but diagnostically useful  dysmorphic features. This potassium channelopathy is due to mutation of the  KCNJ2 gene encoding the protein Kir 2.1. The main muscular manifestation is  periodic paralysis, usually of the hypokalemic type. Muscle biopsy may reveal  tubular aggregates or be normal, as in our patient. Cardiac manifestations are variable and may include a long QT syndrome, premature ventricular contractions,  complex ventricular ectopy, and polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular  tachycardia.

These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of  the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a  uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA.

It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins.

The  embryonic visual system consists of the optic lobe primordium, which, during  later larval life, develops into the prominent optic lobe neuropiles, and the  larval photoreceptor (Bolwig's organ). Both structures derive from a  neurectodermal placode in the embryonic head. Expression of tll is normally  confined to the optic lobe primordium, whereas ato appears in a subset of  Bolwig's organ cells that we call Bolwig's organ founders. Phenotypic analysis, using specific markers for Bolwig's organ and the optic lobe, of tll loss- and  gain-of-function mutant embryos reveals that tll functions to drive cells to  optic lobe as opposed to Bolwig's organ fate.

CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,Avapritinib selectively inhibits oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants by targeting the active conformation of the kinase.," Context: Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth  factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in addition to the data currently available from early clinical studies as well as  those later-stage trials that led to its approval.  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation.

In UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 ,  the antitumor effects of avapritinib were significantly better than with  imatinib or regorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Avapritinib has significant antitumor activity in GIST PDX models  characterized by different KIT mutations and sensitivity to established TKI.  These data provide strong support for the ongoing clinical trials with  avapritinib in patients with GIST (NCT02508532, NCT03465722).  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months).

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNA (circRNA) functions as a microRNA ""sponge"" to counteract microRNA mediated repression of mRNA. It also participates in the regulation of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and plays an important role in the regulation of physiology"," Context: A significant portion of the mammalian genome encodes numerous transcripts that  are not translated into proteins, termed long non-coding RNAs. Initial studies  identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence  of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the  last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and  function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long  non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes.  In this review, we describe the current understanding of long non-coding  RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes: differentiation, development, and  disease.  ,  Context: R-loop is a type of three-stranded nucleic acid structure that is made up of an  RNA:DNA hybrid, formed due to failing separation of a nascent RNA molecule with  transcripting template in transcription or by the re-annealing of RNA molecule  with one of the two strands in a double stranded DNA molecule, along with the  single stranded DNA, which is either the non-template strand in the  transcription bubble or the RNA substituted DNA strand. Formation of R-loops can  occur when transcription goes through a genomic DNA region having a tract of G  bases in the non-template strand in the transcription bubble or through a type  of triplet microsatellite DNA sequences that are known to be associated with certain human diseases. The negative supercoiling forces accumulated in the  transcription bubble, and the misprocessing of RNA precursors, as well as the  delayed utilizations and transportations of RNA molecules to cytoplasm promote R loop formation. Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with  efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by  which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and  ,  Context: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a large class of covalently closed circRNA. As a  member of competitive endogenous RNA, it participates in the regulation of  circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and plays an important role in the regulation of  physiology and pathology. CircRNA is produced by the reverse splicing of exon,  intron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA. Studies have shown that circRNA  is a ubiquitous molecule, which exceeds the linear mRNA distributed in human  cells. Because of its covalent closed-loop structure, circRNA is resistant to  RNase R, which is more stable than linear mRNA; circRNA is highly conserved in  different species. It was found that circRNA competitively adsorbs miRNA, as a miRNA sponge, to involve in the expression regulation of a variety of genes and  plays an important role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis and other  processes. These molecules offer new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention and serve as biomarkers for diagnosis. In this paper, the origin,  characteristics and functions of circRNA and its role in tumor development,  invasion and metastasis, diagnosis and prognosis are reviewed.  ,  Context: Many thousands of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been identified in  metazoan genomes by transcriptome-wide sequencing. Most circRNAs are generated  by back-splicing events from exons of protein-coding genes. A great deal of  progress has recently been made in understanding the genome-wide expression  patterns, biogenesis, and regulation of circRNAs. To date, however, few  functions of circRNAs have been identified. CircRNAs are preferentially expressed in neural tissues and some are found at synapses, suggesting possible  functions in the nervous system. Several circRNAs have been shown to function as  microRNA ""sponges"" to counteract microRNA mediated repression of mRNA. New functions for circRNAs are arising, including protein sequestration,  transcriptional regulation, and potential functions in cancer.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is used at Hamburg, Germany."," Context: There are various in vitro LASER applications, however, the most important ones  include: Hybrid Coulter Principle-LASER Hematology Analyzers. Flow Cytometry  systems. Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH Techniques). Confocal LASER  Scanning Microscopy and Cytometry. From the first fluorescence-based flow  Cytometry device developed in 1968 by Wolfgang Göhde until nowadays, numerous  improvements and new features related to these devices appeared. The relevant  industrial property milestone-documents and their overall numeral trends are  presented. In 1971, J. Madey invented and developed the Free Electron LASER  (FEL), a vacuum-tube that uses a beam of relativistic electrons passing through a periodic, transverse magnetic field (wiggler) to produce coherent radiation,  contained in an optical cavity defined by mirrors. A resonance condition that  involves the energy of the electron beam, the strength of the magnetic field, and the periodicity of the magnet determines the wavelength of the radiation.

The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context: The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing  the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms. The present method offers a potential for ab initio structural  determination in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography.  ,  Context: of these complementary experimental approaches when seeking to understand  protein conformational dynamics. These methods are illustrated using a limited  set of examples including myoglobin and haemoglobin in complex with carbon  monoxide, the simple light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, and the  superoxide scavenger superoxide reductase.

Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function.

It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,"TRalpha2 regulates TAK1 and p38 activities in the heart, mitigating TRalpha1 effects."," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: Down-regulation of DUSP5 has been shown to increase cell proliferation. DUSP5  expression is regulated through epigenetic events involving LncRNA H19 human  choriocarcinoma cell line. However, the molecular mechanisms of H19 modulating  the DUSP5 expression in cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Here, we  identify H19 negatively regulation of DUSP5 gene expression in cardiac  fibroblast and fibrosis tissues. In vivo, the expression levels of H19, DUSP5,  α-SMA, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in cardiac fibrosis tissue were estimated by Western  blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and  immunohistochemistry. In vitro stimulation of freshly isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts with recombinant marine TGF-β1 was performed, followed by  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western  blotting to detect changes in H19, DUSP5, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels. Cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pEX-3-H19 overexpressing, H19-RNAi  down-regulating, or pEGFP-C1-DUSP5 overexpressing.

The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND.

Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to treatment. Four  cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases (one placebo, one  ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one (ubrogepant) probably related.  ,  Context: long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context:  Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, New Jersey) has recently published an integrated  strategy for implementation of dried blood spots (DBS) in late-stage trials for  population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. We applied this strategy for another late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling.

Despite numerous efforts to  identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an  increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology.

Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for  ,  Context:  SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different  geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah  virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not  match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV),  which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ","33200890, 33229362, 32324502, 32562029",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context: Protein acetylation, especially histone acetylation, is the subject of both  research and clinical investigation. At least four small-molecule histone  deacetylase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of  cancer. These and other inhibitors also affect microtubule acetylation. A  multidimensional, chemical genetic screen of 7,392 small molecules was used to  discover ""tubacin,"" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. Tubacin does not affect the level of histone acetylation, gene-expression  patterns, or cell-cycle progression. We provide evidence that class II histone  deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. Only one of the two catalytic domains of HDAC6 possesses tubulin deacetylase activity, and only  this domain is bound by tubacin. Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability  of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. HDAC6 overexpression disrupted  ,  Context: The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal  relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by  using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only  pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule  stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in  MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be both proinflammatory/antitumor and anti-inflammatory/protumor, but a high TAM infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis. Targeting TAMs has emerged as a promising strategy to improve cancer therapy, as deple"," Context:  Tumorigenesis is not only determined by the intrinsic properties of cancer cells  but also by their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment  (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune cells in the TME. During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can  either directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly  recruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the tumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to  exhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression,  metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting TAMs has emerged as a  ,  Context: Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the  growth of, the cancer cells. Molecularly targeted therapy is the modern  expression of this paradigm. Increasingly, however, the realization that the  cancer has co-opted the normal cells of the stroma for its own survival has led  to the concept that the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be targeted for  effective therapy. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated  macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting  ,  Context: In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid  cells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related  inflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis.  In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant  leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a  protective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an immune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to  allow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional  therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit cancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also  responsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint  inhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to  ,  Context:  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune  cells in tumors. TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy.

In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for  primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi  factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences  markers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b  silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis.

In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context:  To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA treatment significantly  knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not  cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down  Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon  ,  Context: In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility is measured through the NOMe-seq methodology.," Context: All mRNA molecules are subject to some degree of post-transcriptional gene  regulation (PTGR) involving sequence-dependent modulation of splicing, cleavage  and polyadenylation, editing, transport, stability, and translation. The recent  introduction of deep-sequencing technologies enabled the development of new  methods for broadly mapping interaction sites between RNA-binding proteins  (RBPs) and their RNA target sites. In this article, we review crosslinking and  immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods adapted for large-scale identification of  target RNA-binding sites and the respective RNA recognition elements. CLIP  methods have the potential to detect hundreds of thousands of binding sites in single experiments although the separation of signal from noise can be  challenging. As a consequence, each CLIP method has developed different  strategies to distinguish true targets from background. We focus on photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP, which relies on the intracellular  incorporation of photoactivatable ribonucleoside analogs into nascent  transcripts, and yields characteristic sequence changes upon crosslinking that  ,  Context: Since Jacob and Monod's characterization of the role of DNA elements in gene  control, it has been recognized that the linear organization of genome structure  is important for the regulation of gene transcription and hence the  manifestation of phenotypes. Similarly, it has long been hypothesized that the  spatial organization (in three dimensions evolving through time), as part of the  epigenome, makes a significant contribution to the genotype-phenotype  transition. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation  capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC and ChIA-Pet) are  increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype.  The apparent simplicity of these methodologies-crosslink chromatin, digest,  dilute, ligate, detect interactions-belies the complexity of the data and the considerations that should be taken into account to ensure the generation and  accurate interpretation of reliable data. Here we discuss the probabilistic  nature of these methodologies and how this contributes to their endogenous  limitations.  ,  Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq.

We investigated binding sites for five different  proteins (IGF2BP1-3, QKI and PUM2) exhibiting different binding patterns. We report near perfect agreement between the two approaches.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"Digit ratio (2D:4D) has been proposed as a putative marker for prenatal hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related to carcinogenesis. It could act as a possible marker for cancer predisposition. Specifically"," Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels. METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21).  ,  Context:  Finger length ratio has been proposed as a putative marker for prenatal hormone  exposure, as well as the action of HOX, AR, and a variant of the LIN28b genes.  These genes have been recently connected to carcinogenesis and digit ratio could help to identify patients with this predisposition.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a primary genetic cardiomyopathy that can be accompanied by dilated cardiomyopathy. In fact, some patients with NCCM also have features of dilated cardiomyopathy,"," Context:  Mutations in the betaMHC (beta-myosin heavy chain), a sarcomeric protein are  responsible for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms  whereby distinct mutations in the betaMHC gene cause two kinds of cardiomyopathy are still unclear. In the present study we report a novel betaMHC mutation found  in a patient with isolated LVNC [LV (left ventricular) non-compaction] and the  phenotype of a mouse mutant model carrying the same mutation. To find the mutation responsible, we searched for genomic mutations in 99 unrelated probands  with dilated cardiomyopathy and five probands with isolated LVNC, and identified  a p.Met531Arg mutation in betaMHC in a 13-year-old girl with isolated LVNC.  ,  Context:  A major advance in the study of the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DC)  has been the identification of a familial trait in a relevant proportion of  cases (more than 25%), which indicates that, at least in these cases, a mutated gene is the cause of the disease. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a  genetically heterogeneous disorder, most frequently with autosomal-dominant  inheritance. Five different loci that cosegregate with the disease have been mapped so far; the identification of the disease genes is still in progress.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context: Although mitochondria derive from alpha-proteobacteria, many proteins acting in  this organelle did not originate from bacteria. In particular, phylogenetic  evidence indicates that RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase and DNA primase--with  homologues encoded by T3/T7-like bacteriophages--have replaced the ancestral  proteins of bacterial origin. To date, there was no clear explanation for this  puzzling observation. Bacterial genomics has now revealed the presence of  cryptic prophages that are related to T3/T7 in several genomes of  proteobacteria. We propose that such a prophage was present in the ancestral  alpha-proteobacterium at the origin of mitochondria and that RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase and DNA primase encoded by this prophage replaced the original  bacterial enzymes to function in mitochondria. Another T3/T7 viral-like RNA  polymerase is functional in the chloroplast, indicating that a strong selection pressure has favored replacement of some cellular proteins by viral proteins in  organelle evolution.  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ","27264557, 28668117, 16157484, 12806117",DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes,"27264557, 28668117",,,,
How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing DDK function. Additionally, Rif1 interacts with PP1 and prevents premature Mc"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop  structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.

We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context:  Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho  ,  Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells.

It is conserved among all seven members of the Mst(3)CGP gene family, that encode  structural proteins of the sperm tail. The TCE is invariably located in the 5'  untranslated region (UTR) at position +28 relative to the transcription start site. In this paper we analyse the mode of action of this element. We show that  protein binding occurs at the TCE after incubation with testis protein extracts  from Drosophila melanogaster.

To this end, we defined a set of 1,119 putative lincRNA genes in D. melanogaster  using modENCODE whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. A large majority (1.1 of 1.3  Mb; 85%) of these bases were not previously reported by modENCODE as being  transcribed. Significant selective constraint on the sequences of these loci  predicts that virtually all have sustained functionality across the Drosophila  clade. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles  that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation  of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. We identify lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in  male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified  whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between D. melanogaster and mouse.

In fact, hypophosphatemia frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected. Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  ,  Context:  Hypophosphatemia is a relatively frequent and a potentially serious adverse drug  effect. Clinically it is characterized by bone pain and muscle weakness. There  are several mechanisms by which a drug can induce hypophosphatemia and they can be classified according to whether or not they are mediated by an excess of  Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). We report two patients with the condition:  (i) A 49-year-old woman with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and gastric sleeve surgery at 46 years of age. After receiving intravenous carboxymaltose iron in  one occasion due to refractory anemia, she developed symptomatic  hypophosphatemia.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication. However, deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, suggesting that its role in DNA replication may be"," Context: We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis.  This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted.  ,  Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  ,  Context: Methylation of the N-terminal region of histones was first described more than  35 years ago, but its biological significance has remained unclear. Proposed  functions range from transcriptional regulation to the higher order packing of  chromatin in progress of mitotic condensation. Primarily because of the recent  discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases  SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. In the  past, investigations concerning the biological significance of histone  methylation were largely limited because of a lack of simple and sensitive analytical procedures for detecting this modification. The present work  investigated the methylation pattern of histone H4 both in different mammalian  organs of various ages and in cell lines by applying mass spectrometric analysis  ","12208845, 27131378, 12154089","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.

All forms of Bartter syndrome  are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary  hyperaldosteronism, but Bartter syndrome type 3 has the most heterogeneous  presentation, extending from severe to very mild. A relatively large number of  CLCNKB mutations have been reported, including gene deletions and nonsense or  missense mutations. However, only 20 CLCNKB mutations have been functionally  analyzed, due to technical difficulties regarding ClC-Kb functional expression in heterologous systems. This review provides an overview of recent progress in  the functional consequences of CLCNKB mutations on ClC-Kb chloride channel  activity.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,"Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single pill, Avandamet."," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours.

This approach has been demonstrated to have therapeutic potential for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy by targeting dystroph"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases.

In fact, one study found that only 9 out of 14 NSCLC cell lines expressed GRPR mRNA, suggesting that its expression"," Context: Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides,  has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC),  and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we  demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides,  neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung  carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no  mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA was determined using in vitro binding studies using membrane target system  containing specific receptor subtypes. We investigated the distribution of  binding sites for (177)Lu-AMBA by receptor autoradiography on human neoplastic  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is  expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context:  We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  ,  Context:  Sueoka and Lobry declared respectively that, in the absence of bias between the  two DNA strands for mutation and selection, the base composition within each  strand should be A=T and C=G (this state is called Parity Rule type 2, PR2). However, the genome sequences of many bacteria, vertebrates and viruses showed  asymmetries in base composition and gene direction. To determine the  relationship of base composition skews with replication orientation, gene function, codon usage biases and phylogenetic evolution, in this paper a program  called DNAskew was developed for the statistical analysis of strand asymmetry  and codon composition bias in the DNA sequence. In addition, the program can  ","7723058, 1978331, 7932780, 14732869","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10, MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1,"," Context: Inherited neuropathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. At least 28  genes and 12 loci have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)  and related inherited neuropathies. Most causes of inherited neuropathy have  been discovered by positional cloning technique and in the past two years, the  pace of CMT gene discovery has accelerated. Genetic studies have revealed the  following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ,  EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating  form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal  recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for CMT2 (autosomal dominant axonal form); LMNA, GAN1, KCC3, TDP1, APTX, SETX for  AR-CMT2 (autosomal recessive axonal form); GIB1 for CMTX (X-linked CMT); DNM2  for CMT-DI (autosomal dominant CMT with intermediate nerve conduction velocities); and DHH for minifascicular neuropathy.

We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context: Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene  cause either autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type  4A or autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with vocal cord  paresis.

We detected six distinct mutant alleles in four families, four of which are novel.  Electrophysiological studies show severely slowed motor nerve conduction  velocities with severely reduced compound muscle action potentials.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine by blocking its uptake in the thyroid gland.," Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: With the global improvement of iodine nutrition, iodine excess is  emerging as a new concern. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to illustrate the physiological effects and potential molecular mechanisms of excessive iodine intake on lipid  metabolism. METHODS: Balb/c mice were given drinking water containing different levels of  iodine for 1 month and treated with 1.2 microg/mL iodine for different periods of time, respectively. Plasma lipid parameters and serum thyroid hormones were  measured. Expressions of hepatic genes were detected by real-time polymerase  chain reactions and Western blot.  ,  Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the  interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in  existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated  release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again  recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine  thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed  systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can  be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is  negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be  considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the  replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake  is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine  release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up  ","17205086, 19916081, 27574319, 23475155","Due to high volatility and environmental mobility, radioactive isotopes of iodine pose a serious risk in the acute phases of a nuclear accident.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,There is no mention of PCDHGC4 in the provided context.," Context: with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a  biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and  albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations exemplify the allelic and genetic heterogeneity and show phenotypic diversity of  WS.  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups.

Copy number variations are distributed non-randomly  in vertebrate genomes, and it was recently reported that ohnologs, which are  duplicated genes derived from whole genome duplication, are refractory to copy  number variations. However, it is unclear what genomic factors affect the  deleterious effects of copy number variations and the biological significance of  the biased genomic distribution of copy number variations remains poorly  understood. Here we show that non-ohnologs neighbouring ohnologs are unlikely to  have copy number variations, resulting in ohnolog-rich regions in vertebrate genomes being copy number variation deserts. Our results suggest that the  genomic location of ohnologs is a determining factor in the retention of copy  number variations and that the dosage-balanced ohnologs are likely to cause the deleterious effects of copy number variations in these regions. We propose that  investigating copy number variation of genes in regions that are typically copy  number variation deserts is an efficient means to find disease-related copy  ","30394532, 22499950, 25186273, 23917329","Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with progressive microcephaly, seizures, and joint anomalies.",34244665,,,,
List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70. However, a stable endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both Med220 and Med70 has been isolated."," Context: The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Using EM and single-particle  reconstruction techniques, we recently completed a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med. Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural  ,  Context: PURPOSE: List-mode processing is an efficient way of dealing with the sparse  nature of positron emission tomography (PET) data sets and is the processing  method of choice for time-of-flight (ToF) PET image reconstruction. However, the  massive amount of computation involved in forward projection and backprojection  limits the application of list-mode reconstruction in practice, and makes it  challenging to incorporate accurate system modeling. METHODS: The authors present a novel formulation for computing line projection  operations on graphics processing units (GPUs) using the compute unified device  architecture (CUDA) framework, and apply the formulation to list-mode ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) image reconstruction. Our method  overcomes well-known GPU challenges such as divergence of compute threads,  limited bandwidth of global memory, and limited size of shared memory, while  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was  determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220 for coactivator recruitment, whereas VDR-directed activation by CRSP/Med occurs  normally. Thus, it appears that CRSP/Med may be regulated by a combinatorial  assembly mechanism that allows promoter-selective function upon exchange of  ,  Context: applications in Drosophila genome engineering, we simplified the standard  two-component CRISPR/Cas9 system by generating a stable transgenic fly line  expressing the Cas9 endonuclease in the germline (Vasa-Cas9 line). By injecting  vectors expressing engineered target-specific guide RNAs into Vasa-Cas9 fly  embryos, mutations were generated from site-specific DNA cleavages and  efficiently transmitted into progenies. Because Cas9 endonuclease is the  universal component of the type II CRISPR/Cas9 system, site-specific genomic  engineering based on this improved platform can be achieved with lower  complexity and toxicity, greater consistency, and excellent versatility.

For example, Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive bacterium, releases EVs that can be purified and characterized. Additionally, Staphylococcus"," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive, obligate anaerobic rod, is an emerging  periodontal pathogen that is frequently isolated from patients with  periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and apical periodontitis. Recent studies have  shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal  pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector  molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and  characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their  immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density  gradient ultracentrifugation.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically through its α2 isoform, which associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins  that form when translation initiation is inhibited. Stress granules are thought  to form by protein-protein interactions of RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate  RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.  ,  Context: may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of  mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant  protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the  effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions  of oxidative stress. RESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress  granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is involved in adding a poly(A) tail to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs, which promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm, and translation."," Context: The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their  stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation. Subsequently, the balance  between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of  translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is  essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to  neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A)  polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to  RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the  turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other small RNAs to modulate their stability or biological functions.  ,  Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move  nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b  does not. Importantly, the inherent positioning properties of the DNA play an  important role in determining where nucleosomes are relocated to by all of these  enzymes. However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are  unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end,  whereas Isw1b can. We also find that there is a correlation between the  inability of enzymes to move nucleosomes close to DNA ends and the preferential  binding to nucleosomes bearing linker DNA. These observations suggest that the accessibility of linker DNA together with the positioning properties of the  underlying DNA play important roles in determining the outcome of remodeling by  these enzymes.  ,  Context: Most eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to considerable post-transcriptional  modification, including capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. The process of  polyadenylation adds a 3' poly(A) tail and provides the mRNA with a binding site  for a major class of regulatory factors, the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs).  These highly conserved polypeptides are found only in eukaryotes; single-celled  eukaryotes each have a single PABP, whereas humans have five and Arabidopis has eight. They typically bind poly(A) using one or more RNA-recognition motifs,  globular domains common to numerous other eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins.  Although they lack catalytic activity, PABPs have several roles in mediating gene expression. Nuclear PABPs are necessary for the synthesis of the poly(A)  tail, regulating its ultimate length and stimulating maturation of the mRNA.  Association with PABP is also a requirement for some mRNAs to be exported from  ","23989958, 20174964, 16606615, 12844354","Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted post-translational regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns.

What is etarfolatide used for?,"Etarfolatide is used as a companion diagnostic imaging agent to identify patients whose tumors express folate receptor-alpha (FRα). It is also used to detect activated but not resting macrophages in vivo, particularly in the context of osteo"," Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis.

Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"According to the provided text, 3D printing has been tested for the construction of bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, and nerves."," Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the  feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly  generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell aggregates during sequential printing cycles. Finally, we demonstrated that  these closely-placed cell aggregates could fuse in two types of thermosensitive  3D gels. Taken together, these data strongly support the feasibility of the proposed novel organ-printing technology.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the  C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group P3(2) with unit-cell parameters a = 67.2, b = 67.2, c = 257.5 Å. The Matthews  coefficient was determined to be 3.41 Å(3) Da(-1) with two molecules in the  asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by the single-anomalous  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal squamous cell line origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients  with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have  refractory disease.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is a minor complication associated with intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane during dental implant placement."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs,  representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (p < .05).  RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the  study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment,  hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus,  and mobility. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated  with implant loss.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ","24155599, 30719578, 25535701, 28030966",Epistaxis is a frequent complication associated with dental implant placement.,"30719578, 24155599",,,,
Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, there is no indication in the provided text that AGY (oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody) has any relation to antidiuretic functions or can be used as an antidiuretic replacement therapy. Its purpose is mentioned"," Context: BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder of the  small intestine. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved  treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from  inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a  novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in  patients with CD.  METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female).  ,  Context: Nine active neurohypophyseal principles have been isolated and identified among  the vertebrates. Arginine-vasotocin is the most ubiquitous, occurring in  pituitary glands from representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. There  is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  ,  Context: The authors report two cases of pseudotumor cerebri in patients taking lithium  for treatment of bipolar disorder. Pseudotumor cerebri is a poorly understood  syndrome characterized by chronic headaches, bilateral papilledema, and  increased intracranial pressure without localized neurologic signs or symptoms,  intracranial mass, or hydrocephalus. Ventriculography, computed tomography, and  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging reveal normal or small ventricles. Multiple etiologies may include Vitamin A toxicity, obesity, head trauma, hypothyroidism  or hyperthyroidism, prolonged steroid therapy or its withdrawal, Addison's  disease, Cushing's disease, pituitary insufficiency, and lithium therapy. Patients treated with lithium whose antidiuretic hormone-cyclic adenosine  monophosphate mechanism is disturbed are most likely to develop pseudotumor  cerebri via disregulation of sodium balance, thyroid-stimulating hormone  ,  Context: psychomotor retardation. Our patient died, as in other cases reported in the  literature, from an episode of sudden death. DISCUSSION: Despite the importance of an early diagnosis of this disorder, it is  usually late. Most children who present hypopituitarism traits in the neonatal  period are not diagnosed at that time, with the subsequent risk of death or  brain damage. Some clinical findings, which appear early on and can provide  clues which aid us to reach a diagnosis, are the appearance of episodes of  hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period, the existence of micropenis and  cryptorchidism with hypoplasic testes, jaundice or the appearance of clinical manifestations of insipid diabetes. Later on nystagmus and neurological symptoms  may appear. The final diagnosis is performed through the use of neuroimaging  techniques (CT or MRI) and hormonal studies.

Relugolix,  an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated  in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH  antagonist. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and  maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in  103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and  neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015. INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels,  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cariprazine was approved for treating schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder, and currently is being evaluated for treating depression in clinical  trials in the United States. We systematically reviewed the literature on the  efficacy and safety of cariprazine. METHODS: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO,  EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through August 31, 2016. The search was not restricted by patient age. Articles published in English or official  English translations were included. RESULTS: Eleven articles that evaluated the use of cariprazine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders were identified. Four trials evaluated the safety and  efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as  an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose  of this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2  inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms ""SGLT2"" and ""SGLT2  inhibitor"" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes.

The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated.

The net effect, v/(u + v),  has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is as it is not mentioned in the provided context.," Context:  Prokaryotic type II CRISPR-Cas systems can be adapted to enable targeted genome  modifications across a range of eukaryotes. Here we engineer this system to  enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an  aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). Using this functionality we developed  a transcriptional activation-based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding of sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared it with the off-target  activity of transcription activator-like (TALs) effectors. Our results reveal  that specificity profiles are sgRNA dependent, and that sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and  ,  Context: Rapid detection of nucleic acids is integral for clinical diagnostics and  biotechnological applications. We recently developed a platform termed SHERLOCK  (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) that combines  isothermal preamplification with Cas13 to detect single molecules of RNA or DNA.  Through characterization of CRISPR enzymology and application development, we  report here four advances integrated into SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) (i) four-channel single-reaction multiplexing with orthogonal CRISPR enzymes; (ii)  quantitative measurement of input as low as 2 attomolar; (iii) 3.5-fold increase  in signal sensitivity by combining Cas13 with Csm6, an auxiliary CRISPR-associated enzyme; and (iv) lateral-flow readout. SHERLOCKv2 can detect  Dengue or Zika virus single-stranded RNA as well as mutations in patient liquid  biopsy samples via lateral flow, highlighting its potential as a multiplexable,  ,  Context: vertebrates. However, we still have very limited information about the  efficiency of mutagenesis, germline transmission rates and off-target effects in  genomes of model organisms. We now demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in  zebrafish is highly efficient, reaching up to 86.0%, and is heritable. The  efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system further facilitated the targeted knock-in  of a protein tag provided by a donor oligonucleotide with knock-in efficiencies  of 3.5-15.6%. Mutation rates at potential off-target sites are only 1.1-2.5%,  demonstrating the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The ease and efficiency  of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with limited off-target effects make it a powerful genome engineering tool for in vivo studies.  ,  Context: Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease found in clustered regularly interspaced  short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) bacterial immune systems, is a versatile tool  for genome editing, transcriptional regulation, and cellular imaging  applications. Structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 alone or bound to  single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and target DNA revealed a bilobed protein architecture  that undergoes major conformational changes upon guide RNA and DNA binding. To  investigate the molecular determinants and relevance of the interlobe  rearrangement for target recognition and cleavage, we designed a split-Cas9  enzyme in which the nuclease lobe and α-helical lobe are expressed as separate polypeptides. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA  recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of  full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage. The use of a modified sgRNA abrogates split-Cas9 activity by preventing dimerization, allowing for the  development of an inducible dimerization system. We propose that split-Cas9 can  act as a highly regulatable platform for genome-engineering applications.

These developments include new  strategies and refinements for shotgun lipidomic approaches that use direct  infusion, including novel fragmentation strategies, identification of multiple  new informative dimensions for mass spectrometric interrogation, and the  development of new bioinformatic approaches for enhanced identification and  quantitation of the individual molecular constituents that comprise each cell's  lipidome. Concurrently, advances in liquid chromatography-based platforms and novel strategies for quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  mass spectrometry for lipidomic analyses have been developed. Through the  synergistic use of this repertoire of new mass spectrometric approaches, the power and scope of lipidomics has been greatly expanded to accelerate progress  toward the comprehensive understanding of the pleiotropic roles of lipids in  biological systems.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,"CYP2D6 is the second most relevant CYP enzyme, metabolizing about 30% of the drugs on the market."," Context: Abstract The number of obese people in the world is growing rapidly worldwide  and has reached epidemic status. Obesity is often associated with the clustering  of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to metabolic  syndrome or syndrome X. Likewise, metabolic syndrome and its associated traits  are major contributing factors to the increase in nephropathy and end stage  renal disease. The specific factors that link the metabolic syndrome traits to  the progression of nephropathy remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have  demonstrated that an imbalance between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cytochrome  P450 (CYP450) arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes in the kidney may contribute to the renal damage associated with obesity. Along these lines, COX-2 inhibition  decreases renal cytokine levels and glomerular injury in obese rats. Peroxisome  proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that also contribute to chronic kidney disease in obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Intriguingly, interactions between PPARs and arachidonic acid metabolites could  be key determinants of renal damage in metabolic syndrome patients. Therefore,  ,  Context: P-gp. The efficacy of desvenlafaxine in treating major depressive disorder has  been established. Adverse events are characteristic of the SNRI class. Notably,  the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events with the 50 mg/day recommended  therapeutic dose is comparable to that seen with placebo. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: incremental benefits with desvenlafaxine, derived from  straight-forward dosing, a simple metabolic profile and lack of interaction with  active transporter P-gp and CYP enzymes may contribute to more consistent  response, good tolerability and lower incidence of drug-drug interactions with  concomitant medications.  ,  Context: The use of medicinal plants concomitantly with conventional drugs can result in  herb-drug interactions that cause fluctuations in drug bioavailability and  consequent therapeutic failure and/or toxic effects. The CYP superfamily of  enzymes plays an important role in herb-drug interactions. Among CYP enzymes,  CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant since they metabolize about 50% and 30%  of the drugs on the market, respectively. Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of in vitro interactions between medicinal plant  extracts and drug substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Standardized extracts  from nine medicinal plants (Bauhinia forficata, Cecropia glaziovii, Cimicifuga racemosa, Cynara scolymus, Echinacea sp., Ginkgo biloba, Glycine max, Ilex  paraguariensis, and Matricaria recutita) were evaluated for their potential  interactions mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Among the extracts tested,  ,  Context: in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing. As RA patients might be treated  with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of  filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were  evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. METHODS: The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential  interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with  drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, were identified using  recombinant enzymes, human microsomes, and cell systems. Furthermore,  filgotinib's interaction potential with CYP3A4 was examined in an open-label study in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the impact of filgotinib  co-administration on the CYP3A4-sensitive substrate midazolam. The potential  interaction with the common RA drug methotrexate was investigated in a clinical  study in RA patients. RESULTS: In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant  concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine  5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug  ","20021073, 21067460, 32786546, 26693854","CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant since they metabolize about 50% and 30% of the drugs on the market, respectively.",32786546,,,,
Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts functions to regulate posttranscriptional stability and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs, affecting cell growth and differentiation. It also interacts with its own mRNA, enhancing its translation and"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: acquisition of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity and  increased p16INK4a expression. Second, infection of cells with an adenoviral  vector that expresses active AMPK increased senescence-associated beta-gal  activity, whereas infection with an adenovirus that expresses dominant-negative  AMPK decreased senescence-associated beta-gal activity. Together, our results  indicate that AMPK activation can cause premature fibroblast senescence through  mechanisms that likely involve reduced HuR function.  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic  overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  ,  Context: increase in the level of HuA. Upregulation of HuA corresponds to previously  documented increases in cytokine expression which are due to increased mRNA  stability following T cell activation. Consistent with these findings, HuA was  down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.  ","19884656, 12730239, 20007147, 9763509","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",,,,
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"The major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning is the periodic occurrences of dinucleotides, specifically WW/SS (weak-weak/strong-strong) and RR/YY (purine-purine/pyrimidine-pyrimidine) patterns."," Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking  the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: minor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the  alpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the  positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between  histones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group  (that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at  the sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the  central part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the  positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these  nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either  an X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of  nucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA). The results presented  here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking  together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the  ,  Context:  Nucleosomes are implicated in transcriptional regulation as well as in packing  and stabilizing the DNA. Nucleosome positions affect the transcription by  impeding or facilitating the binding of transcription factors. The DNA sequence, especially the periodic occurrences of dinucleotides, is a major factor that  affects the nucleosome positioning. We analyzed the Drosophila DNA sequences  bound by H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is a muscle-specific protein found only in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles of vertebrates, such as zebrafish and bovine heart Purkinje fibers. There is no mention of desmin being present in plants."," Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

Our results demonstrated  that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all  are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison.

The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway.

This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available.

CONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being  replaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences  in terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent  words. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm  for the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.  ,  Context: existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the  data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow  ","28407038, 25526884, 19426495",emMAW,28407038,,,,

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose oral suspension vaccine.," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera.

Dabigatran is mainly eliminated via the kidney, hence requiring  dose-adjustment in case of moderate renal insufficiency, and contra-indicated in  case of severe renal insufficiency. Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and  liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are  available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few  interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short  half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote  in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase  their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an  approval has been granted by health authorities.  ,  Context:  Treprostinil is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue with antiplatelet and  vasodilatory properties.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context:  The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) family of receptors are Slit ligands and NELL1/2. Specifically, NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Rob"," Context: structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell  surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies provide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a  combinatorial manner required during neuronal development. While a mechanistic  understanding of Slit mediated Robo signaling has advanced significantly further structural studies on larger assemblies are required for the design of new  experiments to elucidate their role in cell surface receptor complexes. These  will be necessary to understand the role of Slit -Robo signaling in  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells, inducing G(1) arrest and apoptosis."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor.

Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: New drugs have recently been developed, through a better  understanding of the mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer,  including castration-resistant ones (CRPC). This article aims to describe the  mechanisms of action of these new hormonal treatments and their major clinical  outcomes and development programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliographic research in French and English using Medline(®) and Embase(®) using the keywords ""castration-resistant prostate  cancer"", ""abiraterone acetate"", ""orteronel"", ""enzalutamide"", and ""clinical  trials"" was performed. RESULTS: the androgen signaling pathway remains the cornerstone of advanced cancers management. Hence, some molecules target the androgen biosynthesis, as  abiraterone acetate and orteronel, which are selective inhibitors of the enzyme  CYP17. Others act as antagonists of the androgen receptor: the enzalutamide,  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"Waardenburg syndrome and Horner's syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum. Additionally, Ascher's syndrome is also linked to heterochromia iridum."," Context: An 18-year-old Indian girl with upper lip deformity presented with on and off  painless swelling of her both upper eyelids for 3 years. Clinical evaluation  revealed bilateral blepharochalasis, narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure,  decreased outer intercanthal distance, iris coloboma, cleft soft palate, bifid  uvula, sensorineural deafness and double upper lip. Clinical examination of the  thyroid, thyroid hormone assay and ultrasonography revealed normal thyroid gland structure and function. Ascher's syndrome was diagnosed. To our knowledge, this  is the first reported case of Ascher's syndrome associated with iris coloboma,  heterochromia iridum, and narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure and decreased outer intercanthal distance secondary to lengthening of lateral  canthal ligament.  ,  Context: Waardenburg's syndrome consists of lateral displacement of the inner canthi of  the eyes (dystopia canthorum), a broad nasal root and confluent eyebrows,  heterochromia iridum, a white forelock and congenital deafness. The syndrome is  inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of  the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the  deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered.  Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context: Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in  congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have been found to reduce norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue, as reflected in reduced glycerol release."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice.

Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines).

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The fact that histones are modified by acetylation has been known for almost 30  years. The recent identification of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation  has revealed a broader use of this modification than was suspected previously.  Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including  transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation  regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein  interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the  bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling  domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to  phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate  specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation with the process of phosphorylation.  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.  ,  Context: inhibited the expression of arginase-1, fizz1, and mrc1, other genes, such as  ym,1 mgl1, and mgl2, were not affected. The inhibition of arginase-1 occurred at  the transcriptional level with the inhibition of polymerase II binding to the  promoter. IL-4 induced STAT6 phosphorylation and binding to DNA. These  activities were not affected by TSA treatment. However, TSA inhibited C/EBPβ DNA  binding. This inhibitor induced acetylation on lysine residues 215-216, which  are critical for DNA binding. Finally, using macrophages from STAT6 KO mice we  showed that STAT6 is required for the DNA binding of C/EBPβ. These results  demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. These  findings also provide a molecular mechanism to explain the control of gene  expression through deacetylase activity.

Protor-2," Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"In the UK, PSA testing in asymptomatic men is a regular occurrence, and there is general support from GPs for making PSA tests available to 'informed' men concerned about prostate cancer. However, it's unclear whether men are actually being informed"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context:  We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective  studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available  stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening  test for prostate cancer. Of these men, 247 were verified through national vital  statistics offices as having died of prostate cancer, or having developed the disease, and 953 men who did not develop prostate cancer (controls) were  selected, matched to cases for age, study centre and sample storage duration.

While most GPs indicated they would discuss the benefits  and limitations prior to PSA testing, and most GPs favoured a shared approach to  decision making, it is not known to what extent men are actually being informed.  Research is needed to evaluate the most effective approach to assisting men in  making an informed decision about whether or not to have a PSA test.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: To review evidence regarding the potential introduction of prostate  cancer screening programmes and highlight issues pertinent to the management of  screen-detected prostate cancer. METHODS: Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial health care issue in  general and urological practice.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases. Selenium-dependent enzymes have modifying effects on the immune system, and areas with severe selenium deficiency have a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to decreased activity of selenium-dependent glut"," Context: gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest  that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are  mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the  glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal  proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The  ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Ospemifene is effective for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. In a multicenter phase 3 study, ospemifene significantly improved the severity of dyspare"," Context: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent  ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also  called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for  the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women. METHODS: Two open-label, Phase 1 studies were conducted to determine the  pharmacokinetics of ospemifene in healthy postmenopausal women. In the single-dose study, 60 mg of [3H]-ospemifene was orally administered to 6  subjects. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected predose and serially up  to 240 hours postdose. In the multiple-dose study, 12 subjects received 60 mg of ospemifene once daily for 9 days. Blood samples were collected predose and  serially postdose on Day 1, predose on Days 7 and 8, and predose and serially  postdose on Day 9. RESULTS: Ospemifene exhibited high plasma protein binding and was extensively  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel  selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal  atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and  physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo. A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years  who self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis  of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of ospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy  of ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells,  vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of  parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of  ,  Context: vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context:  Mutations in genes encoding cilia proteins cause human ciliopathies, diverse  disorders affecting many tissues. Individual genes can be linked to ciliopathies  with dramatically different phenotypes, suggesting that genetic modifiers may participate in their pathogenesis. The ciliary transition zone contains two  protein complexes affected in the ciliopathies Meckel syndrome (MKS) and  nephronophthisis (NPHP). The BBSome is a third protein complex, affected in the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). We tested whether mutations in MKS, NPHP  and BBS complex genes modify the phenotypic consequences of one another in both  C. elegans and mice. To this end, we identified TCTN-1, the C. elegans ortholog  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a critical role in mediating cardiac  contractility and its function is abnormal in the diabetic heart. However, the  mechanisms underlying SR dysfunction in the diabetic heart are not clear.  Because protein phosphorylation regulates SR function, this study examined the  phosphorylation state of phospholamban, a key SR protein that regulates SR  calcium (Ca2+) uptake in the heart. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley  rats by an injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg kg(-1) i.v.), and the animals  were humanely killed after 6 weeks and cardiac SR function was examined.  Depressed cardiac performance was associated with reduced SR Ca2+-uptake activity in diabetic animals. The reduction in SR Ca2+-uptake was consistent  with a significant decrease in the level of SR Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2a)  protein. The level of phospholamban (PLB) protein was also decreased, however, the ratio of PLB to SERCA2a was increased in the diabetic heart. Depressed SR  Ca2+-uptake was also due to a reduction in the phosphorylation of PLB by the  Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and cAMP-dependent protein  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac  complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondria are susceptible  to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and  oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause  cardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced  calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting.  METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated  glucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular  calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and caspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and  Western blot analysis. RESULTS: High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium  ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context: FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These  functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems,  ,  Context: of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase  (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN expression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.  ,  Context: sensitivity of sGC to nitric oxide, leading to increased cyclic guanosine  monophosphate generation (a key signalling molecule involved in regulating  vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation).

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a crucial role in genome organization by occupying chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and associating with proteins that interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth1, Ssu72, and histone H4. Additionally, Mediator"," Context:  In addition to mediating sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle, the  cohesin complex associates with CTCF and with active gene regulatory elements to  form long-range interactions between its binding sites. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture had shown that cohesin's main role in interphase genome  organization is in mediating interactions within architectural chromosome  compartments, rather than specifying compartments per se. However, it remains unclear how cohesin-mediated interactions contribute to the regulation of gene  expression. We have found that the binding of CTCF and cohesin is highly  enriched at enhancers and in particular at enhancer arrays or ""super-enhancers""  ,  Context: Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring  signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. We  have combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator  from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator  occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically  with Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in  immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between  Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin.  These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly, mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been  shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we  have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin  associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries,  such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a  ,  Context: had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a  common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization  revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing  long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.  These data demonstrate a crucial role for Nipbl in limb development, and support  the view that its actions on multiple gene pathways result from its influence,  together with Mediator, on regulation of long-range chromosomal interactions.  ,  Context: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that  allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional  experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction partners were repressing regulatory elements.

Gram negative  bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging  resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures  before starting antibiotics.

These studies support the further development of SPR741 in  combination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative  bacterial infections.  ,  Context: Bacterial skin infections are important to recognize because we have the means  to eradicate almost all of them. Primary skin infections are mainly caused by  staphylococci or streptococci. Staphylococci infections present as furuncles and  carbuncles, superficial folliculitis, impetigo or rarely the Scalded Skin  Syndrome. Streptococcal infections present as impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas or  cellulitis. Corynebacteria causes erythrasma, trichomycosis or pitted  keratolysis.
