What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, specifically H3K27me3, plays a crucial role in medulloblastoma. High levels of H3K27me3 are observed in Group 3 and 4 tumors, which correlates with poor"," Context: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive pediatric brain tumor  with a median survival of 1 year after diagnosis. It has been reported recently  that about 80% of DIPG cases and 70% of midline glioblastomas contain a mutation  at one allele of the H3F3A gene (encoding histone H3 variant H3.3), replacing  the lysine 27 with methionine (K27M). In order to facilitate diagnosis of DIPG  patients, a quick and reliable method to identify the H3F3A K27M mutation is needed. Here, we describe a real-time PCR-based procedure involving a  mutant-specific primer, a blocker oligonucleotide, and a reverse primer that can  differentiate samples with H3F3A K27M mutation from those that do not. We first tested four different mutant-specific primers for their ability to selectively  amplify H3F3A K27M-mutant allele and found that one primer amplified the mutant  allele more efficiently than the rest. We then determined the optimal  ,  Context: Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met  (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1  (HIST3H1B). We report that human diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs)  containing the K27M mutation display significantly lower overall amounts of H3  with trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are  sufficient to reduce the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. We find that  H3K27M inhibits the enzymatic activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2  through interaction with the EZH2 subunit. In addition, transgenes containing  lysine-to-methionine substitutions at other known methylated lysines (H3K9 and H3K36) are sufficient to cause specific reduction in methylation through  inhibition of SET-domain enzymes. We propose that K-to-M substitutions may  represent a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in a variety of pathologies.  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in  pediatric glioblastoma. Additionally, H3F3A K27M substitutions occur in gliomas  that arise at midline locations (eg, pons, thalamus, spine); moreover, this substitution occurs mainly in tumors in children and adolescents. Here, we  sought to determine the association between H3F3A mutations and adult thalamic  glioma. METHODS: Genomic H3F3A was sequenced from 20 separate thalamic gliomas. Additionally, for 14 of the 20 gliomas, 639 genes--including cancer-related  genes and chromatin-modifier genes--were sequenced, and the Infinium  HumanMethylation450K BeadChip was used to examine DNA methylation across the  genome.  ,  Context: which hinder histone methylation and are implicated in oncogenesis, are recently  identified in several cancer disease and called oncohistones. Well-known  oncohistones, with mutations on both H3.1 and H3.3, include H3K36M in  chondroblastoma, H3K27M in glioma, and H3G34 mutations that exist in bone  cancers and gliomas. Oncohistone expression can lead to epigenome/transcriptome  reprogramming and eventually to oncogenesis. The H3K27M, H3G34V/R, and H3K36M  histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.  Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of H3K27M-driven tumorigenesis has recently  led to the identification of some potential therapeutic targets in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this chapter, we will review and summarize recent  studies on the H3K27M-driven tumorigenic mechanisms and properties and the role  of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones in brain tumors.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts. However, it is mentioned that STAG1 and STAG2 are cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister chromatid cohesion in mit"," Context: an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.  We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate. This  function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions,  including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against  oxidative stress and ageing. FoxOs are regulated by a variety of different  growth factors and hormones, and their activity is tightly controlled by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation,  ubiquitination and interaction with different proteins and transcription  factors. This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO  proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease  and ageing processes.  ,  Context:  STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member, STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Aiming to understand cellular responses to different perturbations,  the NIH Common Fund Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures  (LINCS) program involves many institutes and laboratories working on over a  thousand cell lines. The community-based Cell Line Ontology (CLO) is selected as  the default ontology for LINCS cell line representation and integration. RESULTS: CLO has consistently represented all 1097 LINCS cell lines and included information extracted from the LINCS Data Portal and ChEMBL. Using MCF 10A cell  line cells as an example, we demonstrated how to ontologically model LINCS  cellular signatures such as their non-tumorigenic epithelial cell type, three-dimensional growth, latrunculin-A-induced actin depolymerization and  apoptosis, and cell line transfection.

It integrates our refined prediction of specific  expression patterns both in genes as well as in individual isoforms with  man-mouse orthology data. In combination with the features for  combining/contrasting the genes expressed in different tissues, T-STAG  implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of  differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with  significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined categorization of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) according to the normalization  of cDNA libraries allows searching for putative low-abundant transcripts. The  results are tightly linked to our visualization tools, GeneNest (expression patterns of genes) and SpliceNest (gene structure and alternative splicing).

METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: the Hardell group and Interphone results for mobile phone use. Results for  cordless phones are lacking in Interphone. The meta-analysis gave for glioma in  the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1.71, 95%  confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.81 in the ≥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell  group) latency group. Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2.29,  95% CI=1.56-3.37. The results for meningioma were OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.31-4.98 and  OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.81-2.23, respectively. Regarding acoustic neuroma ipsilateral  mobile phone use in the latency group ≥10 years gave OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.73-4.45.  For ipsilateral cumulative use ≥1640h OR=2.55, 95% CI=1.50-4.40 was obtained. Also use of cordless phones increased the risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma  in the Hardell group studies. Survival of patients with glioma was analysed in  the Hardell group studies yielding in the >10 years latency period hazard ratio (HR)=1.2, 95% CI=1.002-1.5 for use of wireless phones. This increased HR was  based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme).  Decreased HR was found for low-grade astrocytoma, WHO grades I-II, which might  ,  Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context:  Utilization behavior (UB) consists of reaching out and using objects in the  environment in an automatic manner and out of context. This behavior has been  correlated to frontal lobe dysfunction, especially of the right hemisphere.

Video/EEG studies showed a striking correlation between mobile phone utilization and ictal  epileptic activity. Clinical and EEG findings were markedly reduced after the  introduction of antiepileptic drugs. This case study suggests that UB may be  ,  Context: from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in various genomes, as demonstrated by its application in the fly genome."," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter  elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone also at https://github.com/computationalBiology/NPLB/ (Mac OSX/Linux). CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when  developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where  predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on  experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been  renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several  hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been  used for training ID predictors. RESULTS: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on  the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant  amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work  quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is  different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound  ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context: analytical methods for future studies. For example, we estimated the effect of  number of mosquitoes dissected on variability of % inhibition, and simulated the  relationship between % inhibition in oocyst intensity and % inhibition of  prevalence of infected mosquitos at different mean oocysts in the control. SMFA  is one of the few biological assays used in preclinical and early clinical  development of transmission-blocking vaccines, and this study strongly supports  its further development and application.  ,  Context: Oxidant stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  In the late 1980s, biological studies demonstrated that oxygen-free radicals  oxidize low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in the creation of foam  cells and inciting the cascade of biological events that ultimately result in  the formation of atherosclerosis. In vitro studies showed the ability of  antioxidant vitamins to scavenge free radicals and block the oxidation of  low-density lipoprotein. This data was supported in vivo by early observational  studies suggesting the benefit of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, in the  prevention of coronary artery disease. On the basis of these studies, the use of antioxidant supplements by the general population increased substantially and  became a multibillion dollar industry. Despite strong biological evidence and  promising observational data, more rigorous scientific evaluation did not support a causational relationship between vitamin supplements and lowering  coronary artery disease risk. Several prospective, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit and possibly harmful effects.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery."," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression.

Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence.

The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples.

The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which  measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of  disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond  to chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004  and has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora  M. Hansen, and Barbara Susnik answered questions regarding the incorporation of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay into routine clinical practice. This expert  dialog offers an update and clinical insights into when, how, and why clinicians  might incorporate the Oncotype DX assay into the management of their breast cancer patients. Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX  assay in node-positive patients is discussed.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area.," Context: Alpha-synuclein forms the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the  defining neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and dementia  with Lewy bodies. Here we show that alpha-synuclein is also the major component  of the filamentous inclusions of multiple system atrophy which comprises several  neurodegenerative diseases with a shared filamentous pathology in nerve cells  and glial cells. These findings provide an unexpected link between multiple  system atrophy and Lewy body disorders and establish that  alpha-synucleinopathies constitute a major class of human neurodegenerative  disorder.  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks.

Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: A common finding in many neurodegenerative diseases is the presence of inclusion  bodies made of aggregated proteins in neurons of affected brain regions. In  Parkinson's disease, the inclusion bodies are referred to as Lewy bodies and  their main component is alpha-synuclein. Although many studies have suggested  that inclusion bodies may be cell protective, it is still not clear whether Lewy  bodies promote or inhibit dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease. Synphilin-1 interacts with alpha-synuclein and is present in Lewy bodies.  Accumulation of ubiquitylated synphilin-1 leads to massive formation of  inclusion bodies, which resemble Lewy bodies by their ability to recruit alpha-synuclein. We have recently isolated an isoform of synphilin-1,  synphilin-1A, that spontaneously aggregates in cells, and is present in  detergent-insoluble fractions of brain protein samples from  ,  Context:  Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS).  Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS. However, alternative splicing of the AS gene is also known to modify AS  aggregation propensities. Splicing gives rise to four related forms of the  protein, the main transcript and those that lack exon 4, exon 6, or both.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)."," Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight  recordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low  availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is  recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck  circumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0%  of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS  model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the  area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703;  0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%:  (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability  of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive  predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the  same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe  OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA  probability for a score of 17. CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: There is a growing number of patients with sleep-disordered  breathing (SDB) referred to sleep clinics. Therefore, a simple but useful  screening tool is urgent. The NoSAS score, containing only five items, has been  developed and validated in population-based studies.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,Raoultella terrigena is a bacterial species associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) production.," Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context: This paper presents results of an investigation and listing of tick species  found in China during a survey in all 28 provinces. This will be a step towards  a definitive list of tick species and their distribution. To date, the tick  fauna of this area consists of 117 species in the following families:  Argasidae-Argas (7 species), Carios (4 species) and Ornithodoros (2 species);  Ixodidae-Amblyomma (8 species), Anomalohimalaya (2 species), Dermacentor (12  species), Haemaphysalis (44 species), Hyalomma (6 species), Ixodes (24 species)  and Rhipicephalus (8 species). Some well known ticks carrying and transmitting  many infectious agents to man and domestic animals are also found in China. These include Ixodes persulcatus, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Rhipicephalus  sanguineus, R. (Boophilus) microplus and Hyalomma asiaticum. It is worth  mentioning that Ixodes rangtangensis Teng and Haemaphysalis xinjiangensis Teng should be relegated to a synonym of I. moschiferi and Hae. danieli,  respectively. The distribution of ticks over the provinces of China is also  discussed. The information on ticks in some areas such as Henan is not  exhaustive.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context: dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to  the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation  with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field  stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter  of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field  stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence  of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such  as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply  of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ","22491190, 21076829, 24075201, 25838885, 18346126, 28405579","Selective sweep is a phenomenon in which the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles within a population reduces genetic diversity at partially linked neutral loci.

List markers for autophagy.,"LC3II proteins, ATG5 protein, and LC3-II are markers for autophagy. Additionally, GFP-LC3 and GFP-Atg5 can be used to monitor autophagy."," Context:  BACKGROUND: Autophagy induction can increase or decrease anticancer drug  efficacy. Anticancer drug-induced autophagy induction is poorly characterized in  osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on camptothecin (CPT)-induced cytotoxicity in OS. METHODS: Autophagy-inhibited DLM8 and K7M3 metastatic murine OS cell lines were  generated by infection with lentiviral shRNA directed against the essential autophagy protein ATG5. Knockdown of ATG5 protein expression and inhibition of  autophagy was confirmed by immunoblot of ATG5 and LC3II proteins, respectively.  Metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay and cell viability was determined  ,  Context: AIMS: On the basis of our previous reports that cardioprotection induced by  ischaemic preconditioning induces autophagy and that resveratrol, a polyphenolic  antioxidant present in grapes and red wine induces preconditioning-like effects,  we sought to determine if resveratrol could induce autophagy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Resveratrol at lower doses (0.1 and 1 microM in H9c2  cardiac myoblast cells and 2.5 mg/kg/day in rats) induced cardiac autophagy  shown by enhanced formation of autophagosomes and its component LC3-II after  hypoxia-reoxygenation or ischaemia-reperfusion. The autophagy was attenuated  with the higher dose of resveratrol. The induction of autophagy was correlated with enhanced cell survival and decreased apoptosis. Treatment with rapamycin  (100 nM), a known inducer of autophagy, did not further increase autophagy  compared with resveratrol alone. Autophagic inhibitors, wortmannin (2 microM) and 3-methyladenine (10 mM), significantly attenuated the resveratrol-induced  autophagy and induced cell death. The activation of mammalian target of  rapamycin (mTOR) was differentially regulated by low-dose resveratrol, i.e. the  ,  Context: point to fully integrated, multitiered regulatory and effector connections  between autophagy and nearly all facets of innate and adaptive immunity.  Autophagy in the immune system as a whole confers measured immune responses; on  the flip side, suppression of autophagy can lead to inflammation and tissue  damage, as evidenced by Crohn's disease predisposition polymorphisms in  autophagy basal apparatus (Atg16L) and regulatory (IRGM) genes. Polymorphisms in  the IRGM gene in human populations have also been linked to predisposition to  tuberculosis. There are several areas of most recent growth: first, links  between autophagy regulators and infectious disease predisposition in human populations; second, demonstration of a role for autophagy in infection control  in vivo in animal models; third, the definition of specific antiautophagic  defenses in highly evolved pathogens; and fourth, recognition of connections between the ubiquitin system and autophagy of bacteria (and interestingly  mitochondria, which are incidentally organelles of bacterial evolutionary  origin) via a growing list of modifier and adapter proteins including  ,  Context: known to exist. Recent evidence suggests that this form of autophagy enforces  intracellular quality control by selectively disposing of aberrant protein  aggregates and damaged organelles--common denominators in various forms of  neurodegenerative diseases. By definition, this form of autophagy, termed  quality-control (QC) autophagy, must be different from nutrient-regulated  autophagy in substrate selectivity, regulation and function. We have recently  identified the ubiquitin-binding deacetylase, HDAC6, as a key component that  establishes QC. HDAC6 is not required for autophagy activation per se; rather,  it is recruited to ubiquitinated autophagic substrates where it stimulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by promoting F-actin remodeling in a  cortactin-dependent manner. Remarkably, HDAC6 and cortactin are dispensable for  starvation-induced autophagy. These findings reveal that autophagosomes associated with QC are molecularly and biochemically distinct from those  associated with starvation autophagy, thereby providing a new molecular  framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and therapeutic  ,  Context: (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins  contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  monitoring autophagy, including the use of GFP-LC3 and GFP-Atg5, are discussed.  ,  Context: Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (Pérez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture.

To address this shortcoming, we present  Sushi.R, an R/Bioconductor package that allows flexible integration of genomic  visualizations into highly customizable, publication-ready, multi-panel figures  from common genomic data formats including Browser Extensible Data (BED),  bedGraph and Browser Extensible Data Paired-End (BEDPE). Sushi.R is open source  and made publicly available through GitHub (https://github.com/dphansti/Sushi)  and Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Sushi.html).  ,  Context: The coupling of chromosome conformation capture (3C) with next-generation  sequencing technologies enables the high-throughput detection of long-range  genomic interactions, via the generation of ligation products between DNA  sequences, which are closely juxtaposed in vivo. These interactions involve  promoter regions, enhancers and other regulatory and structural elements of  chromosomes and can reveal key details of the regulation of gene expression.  3C-seq is a variant of the method for the detection of interactions between one  chosen genomic element (viewpoint) and the rest of the genome. We present  r3Cseq, an R/Bioconductor package designed to perform 3C-seq data analysis in a number of different experimental designs. The package reads a common aligned  read input format, provides data normalization, allows the visualization of  candidate interaction regions and detects statistically significant chromatin interactions, thus greatly facilitating hypothesis generation and the  interpretation of experimental results. We further demonstrate its use on a  series of real-world applications.  ,  Context: are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures. These packages  provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the  genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and  coverage vectors.

This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other  Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential  expression analysis and visualization.  ,  Context: This chapter provides a description and illustration of CancerMutationAnalysis  and Cancer MutationMCMC, two open source R packages specifically designed for  the analysis of somatic mutations in cancer genome studies, at both the gene and  gene-set levels.  ,  Context: to inherent biases and lower accuracy.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, recent studies have indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides, suggesting that circRNAs can play a role in cellular physiology function."," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of endogenous single-stranded covalently  closed RNAs, primarily produced from pre-mRNAs via non-canonical back-splicing.  circRNAs are highly conserved, stable, and expressed in tissue- and  development-specific pattern. circRNAs play essential roles in physiological  process as well as cancer biology. By the advances of deep sequencing and  bioinformatics, the number of circRNAs have increased explosively. circRNAs  function as miRNA/protein sponge, protein scaffold, protein recruitment,  enhancer of protein function, as well as templates for translation involved in  the regulation of transcription/splicing, translation, protein degradation, and pri-miRNA processing in human cancers and contributed to the pathogenesis of  cancer. Numerous circRNAs may function in diverse manners. In this review, we  survey the current understanding of circRNA functions in human cancer including miRNA sponge, circRNA-protein interaction, and circRNA-encoded protein, and  summarize available databases for circRNA annotation and functional prediction.  ,  Context: information on the very small contribution of long non-coding genes to the  production of canonical circRNAs. Analyses of the other reads revealed two  origins for non-canonical circRNAs: (1) Intronic sequences for lariat-derived  intronic circRNAs and intron circles, (2) Mono-exonic genes (mostly non-coding)  for either a new type of circRNA (including only part of the exon: sub-exonic  circRNAs) or, even more rarely, mono-exonic canonical circRNAs. The most complex  set of sub-exonic circRNAs was produced by RNase_MRP (ribozyme RNA). We  specifically investigated the intronic circRNA of ATXN2L, which is probably an  independently transcribed sisRNA (stable intronic sequence RNA). We may be witnessing the emergence of a new non-coding gene in the porcine genome. Our  results are evidence that most non-canonical circRNAs originate from non-coding  sequences.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?","No. Antiretroviral drugs are used for PrEP, such as Truvada, which acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."," Context: regimen of CAB and rilpivirine have demonstrated promising virological activity  in oral as well as in parenteral therapy, which are currently investigated in  phase three trials. Moreover, CAB protected macaques from experimental  simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection and showed promising tolerability  in the first trial in humans for preexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection. CAB  might, therefore, provide the basis of the new treatment paradigm of parenteral  treatment and prevention of HIV infection.  ,  Context:  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental approach to HIV prevention  and consists of antiretroviral drugs to be taken before potential HIV exposure  in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection and continued during periods of risk. An effective PrEP could provide an additional safety net to sexually  active persons at risk, when combined with other prevention strategies. Women  represent nearly 60% of adults infected with HIV and PrEP can be a female-controlled prevention method for women who are unable to negotiate condom  use. Two antiretroviral nucleoside analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor  drugs are currently under trial as PrEP drugs, namely  ,  Context: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are widely used to treat  HIV-1-infected individuals; indeed most first-line antiretroviral therapies  typically include one NNRTI in combination with two nucleoside analogs. In 2008,  the next-generation NNRTI etravirine was approved for the treatment of  HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-experienced individuals, including those  with prior NNRTI exposure. NNRTIs are also increasingly being included in  strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection. For example: (1) nevirapine is used to  prevent mother-to-child transmission; (2) the ASPIRE (MTN 020) study will test  whether a vaginal ring containing dapivirine can prevent HIV-1 infection in women; (3) a microbicide gel formulation containing the urea-PETT derivative  MIV-150 is in a phase I study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics and acceptability; and (4) a long acting rilpivirine formulation is under-development for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Given their  widespread use, particularly in resource-limited settings, as well as their low  genetic barriers to resistance, there are concerns about overlapping resistance  ,  Context: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral  medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used  PrEP medication (Truvada® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1  reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV  antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation  screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult  to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be  highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone'  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention is highly  effective when taken as prescribed. Adherence to required dosing regimens for  protection may pose challenges. Long-acting agents for HIV prevention may have the potential to improve adherence via favorable pharmacokinetics supportive of  infrequent dosing. This review focuses on the potential benefits and  considerations for the study and use of 2 long-acting injectable agents, cabotegravir (GSK1265744LA, CAB LA) and rilpivirine (TMC278LA, RPV LA), for use  as chemoprophylaxis for HIV prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral RPV is United States Food and Drug Administration approved  ,  Context:  Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral drugs by  HIV-negative people to prevent HIV infection. WHO released new guidelines in  2015 recommending PrEP for all populations at substantial risk of HIV infection. To prepare these guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of values and  preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP, women, heterosexual  men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people and people who inject drugs, and among healthcare  providers who may prescribe PrEP.

What is the purpose of HaploReg v4?,"HaploReg v4 is used for the prediction of putative causal variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations"," Context: genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal  variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and  the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative,  epigenomic and regulatory annotations. Since first launching the website in  2011, we have greatly expanded HaploReg, increasing the number of chromatin  state maps to 127 reference epigenomes from ENCODE 2012 and Roadmap Epigenomics,  incorporating regulator binding data, expanding regulatory motif disruption  annotations, and integrating expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) variants  and their tissue-specific target genes from GTEx, Geuvadis, and other recent studies. We present these updates as HaploReg v4, and illustrate a use case of  HaploReg for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-associated SNPs  with putative brain regulatory mechanisms.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between DNA damage-related genetic  variants and lung cancer susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled patients from the Cancer Hospital of  Jiangsu Province and Jiangsu Province Hospital from 2003 to 2009. Controls were  randomly selected from individuals who visited the same hospital or a  community-based health examination program during the same time period. A 5 ml venous blood sample was obtained from each participant and epidemiological  information was collected on a standard questionnaire. Illumina Infinium(®)  BeadChip was used for genotyping of 35 DNA damage-related single nucleotide variations (SNVs), which were identified in our previous study. Multivariate and  binary logistic regressions were used to calculate the OR and 95%CI for lung  cancer risk. HaploReg V4.1 and Regulome DB were used to understand functional  ,  Context: for virulence gene expression in other bacteria. Here, I present a novel insight  that may clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes.  Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently  the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs  of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production  of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades  chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a  virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the  course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are  much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and  HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans. Further research is needed to understand the  role of cholera toxin in the environmental existence of V. cholerae.  ,  Context: The goal of the Human Proteome Project (HPP) is to fully characterize the 21,000  human protein-coding genes with respect to the estimated two million proteins  they encode. As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource  to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment. Similarly  to the Human Genome Project (HGP), the HPP chose a chromosome-centric approach,  assigning different chromosomes to different countries. Here we introduce a scoring method for chromosome ranking based on several characteristics,  including relevance to health problems, existing published knowledge, and  current transcriptome and proteome coverage. The score of each chromosome was computed as a weighted combination of indexes reflecting the aforementioned  characteristics. The approach is tailored to the chromosome-centric HPP (C-HPP),  and is advantageous in that it takes into account currently available  ,  Context: others more paper-based documentations. In the questionnaires on feasibility and  usefulness of Haemoassist, three patients preferred the electronic tool, two  patients wanted to continue using paper-based diaries, and one had no  preference. The study shows that an electronic documentation system is feasible  for haemophilia patients and provides the physician with the opportunity to more  closely monitor patients. However, not all patients seem to be qualified for  using an electronic tool, and the tool has to run reliably without major errors  for ensuring reliability and acceptability. In the future, Haemoassist might  support quality assurance in haemophilia treatment and improve guidance in the home-care setting.  ,  Context: hCMG complex), coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with  viruses expressing the hCMG complex and hCtf4, and from HeLa cell chromatin  after benzonase and immunoprecipitation steps. The stability of the hCtf4-CMG  complex depends upon interactions between hCtf4 and multiple components of the  hCMG complex. The hCtf4-CMG complex, like the hCMG complex, contains DNA  helicase activity that is more salt-resistant than the helicase activity of the  hCMG complex. We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric  hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts  as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex. The role of the hCMG complex as the core of the replisome is also discussed.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context:  Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events  ,  Context:  Inhibition of an initiating oncogene often leads to extensive tumour cell death,  a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. This has led to the search for  compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. However, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal  instability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint  pathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene addiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by  overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the  regression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours  ,  Context: G-Quadruplex, a unique secondary structure in nucleic acids found throughout  human genome, elicited widespread interest in the field of therapeutic research.  Being present in key regulatory regions of oncogenes, RNAs and telomere,  G-Quadruplex structure regulates transcription, translation, splicing, etc.  Changes in its structure and stability leads to differential expression of  oncogenes causing cancer. Thus, targeting G-Quadruplex structures with small molecules/other biologics has shown elevated research interest. Covering  previous reports, in this review, we try to enlighten the facts on the  structural diversity in G-Quadruplex ligands aiming to provide newer insights to design first-in-class drugs for the next-generation cancer treatment.  ,  Context: Transcription stimulates the genetic instability of trinucleotide repeat  sequences. However, the mechanisms leading to transcription-dependent repeat  length variation are unclear. We demonstrate, using biochemical and genetic  approaches, that the formation of stable RNA.DNA hybrids enhances the  instability of CTG.CAG repeat tracts. In vitro transcribed CG-rich repeating  sequences, unlike AT-rich repeats and nonrepeating sequences, form stable,  ribonuclease A-resistant structures. These RNA.DNA hybrids are eliminated by  ribonuclease H treatment. Mutation in the rnhA1 gene that decreases the activity  of ribonuclease HI stimulates the instability of CTG.CAG repeats in E. coli. Importantly, the effect of ribonuclease HI depletion on repeat instability  requires active transcription. We also showed that transcription-dependent  CTG.CAG repeat instability in human cells is stimulated by siRNA knockdown of RNase H1 and H2. In addition, we used bisulfite modification, which detects  single-stranded DNA, to demonstrate that the nontemplate DNA strand at  transcribed CTG.CAG repeats remains partially single-stranded in human genomic  ,  Context: Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) is an evolutionarily conserved histone  methyltransferase that methylates lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Mammalian  DOT1L participates in the regulation of transcription, development,  erythropoiesis, differentiation, and proliferation of normal cells. However, the  role of DOT1L in cancer cell proliferation has not been fully elucidated. DOT1L  siRNA-transfected A549 or NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells displayed a  nonproliferating multinucleated phenotype. DOT1L-deficient cells also showed  abnormal mitotic spindle formation and centrosome number, suggesting that DOT1L  deficiency leads to chromosomal missegregation. This chromosomal instability in DOT1L-deficient cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase and induced  senescence as determined by enhanced activity of senescence-associated  β-galactosidase activity. Meanwhile, overexpression of a catalytically active DOT1L, not an inactive mutant, restored DOT1L siRNA-induced phenotypes. Overall,  these data imply that down-regulation of DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation  disturbs proliferation of human cells. In addition, although H3K79 methylation  ,  Context: Recent in vivo and in vitro data of patients analyzed for genetic susceptibility  to radiation during cancer therapy have shown structural changes in the  chromosomes to be prevalent both in the patients being treated and in their  immediate family members. As structural changes in chromosomes frequently lead  to activation of proto-oncogenes and elimination of tumor-suppressor genes, they  represent important mechanisms for the initiation of DNA repair processes and tumorigenesis. With the exception of rare genetic syndromes such as AT (Ataxia  telangiectasia) or NBS (Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome), the background for the  inheritance of genetic susceptibility to radiation is unknown. Recently, a large-scale genetic screen of mouse mutants has been established within the  German Human Genome Project (Hrabè de Angelis and Balling 1998).

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, immediate-early genes (IEGs) create a ripple effect of transcription. Transcriptional activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated expression, as seen in the simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs and surrounding"," Context: primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.  Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all  transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of  cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied  ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of  cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals ""blob"" structures within the supragranular  layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have  not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and  c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period  of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers,  where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in  layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred  ,  Context: The SPT4, SPT5, and SPT6 gene products define a class of transcriptional  repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought to function through  their effects on chromatin assembly or stability. Mutations in these genes  confer a similar range of phenotypes to mutations in HIR genes, which encode  transcriptional repressors that regulate expression of many of the core histone  genes. Here we show that mutations in the three SPT genes also affect  transcription of the histone genes that reside at the HTA1-HTB1 locus. HTA1-lacZ  transcription was reduced in each spt mutant background, an effect that required  a negative site in the HTA1 promoter. The transcriptional effect could be reversed by the overproduction of histones H2A and H2B in an spt4 mutant and  histones H3 and H4 in all three spt mutants. Suppression of the spt4  transcriptional defect was dependent on the overproduction of both histones H2A and H2B, and required the presence of N-terminal amino acids in both histones.  The results are consistent with the idea that the effects of the spt mutations  on nucleosome assembly and/or stability activate repressors of HTA1  transcription.  ,  Context: The Ty2-917 element is a member of the Ty2 class of retroviruslike transposable  elements of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that regions downstream of the  Ty2-917 transcription start site modulate its transcription. One region was  located downstream of the transcription initiation site (position 240) and  within the first 559 base pairs of the element. This region had a dramatic  effect, causing an approximately 1,000-fold increase in steady-state levels of RNA. The region stimulated transcription when placed in either orientation  upstream of a heterologous gene, HIS4, lacking its own upstream activation  sequence (UAS). We termed this positively acting region an enhancer, by analogy to sites described in higher cells, to distinguish it from yeast UASs which do  not function when placed within the transcribed portion of the gene. Though,  like some higher eucaryotic enhancers, the Ty2-917 enhancer is located within  ,  Context: levels of transcription from the RNA polymerase I promoter and enzymatically  active CAT protein. However, further examination revealed that CAT protein is  not translated from RNA that begins at the normal rRNA transcription initiation  site. Polysomal RNA is devoid of such RNA and instead consists of CAT-encoding  transcripts that begin elsewhere in the mouse ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. Since  transcription of these aberrant RNAs is stimulated by the addition of a murine  sarcoma virus enhancer segment, they are probably transcribed by RNA polymerase  II. Transcripts that map to the authentic rRNA start site are not similarly  enhanced. Moreover, unlike the RNAs deriving from the rRNA initiation site, these aberrant RNAs are more stable and the level of translatable CAT  transcripts is suppressed by inclusion of larger segments of the rDNA promoter  regions. Fortuitously initiated mRNAs are also formed in the absence of any natural eukaryotic promoter sequence. From these data we conclude that there is  no evidence that normal RNA polymerase I transcription yields functional mRNA  and that transcriptional enhancement appears to be RNA polymerase specific.  ,  Context: an ergosterol auxotrophic mutant devoid of squalene-synthase activity.  Ergosterol starvation leads to an 8-16-fold increase in ERG2 gene expression.

The chest roentgenogram demonstrated cardiomegaly and left lower lobe  atelectasis. Echocardiography showed circumferential pericardial effusion with  signs of cardiac tamponade. Pericardial biopsy and fluid analysis were  consistent with fibrino-purulent pericarditis. Despite broad-spectrum  antibiotics, percutaneous and subsequently surgical drainage, pericardial effusion and tamponade recurred. We report successful treatment of a  non-resolving fibrino-purulent pericardial effusion by combined intrapericardial  irrigation of fibrinolytics and systemic corticosteroids administration as an alternative to pericardectomy.  ,  Context: AIM: Hemophilic pseudotumors result from repeated episodes of bleeding into  bone, subperiosteum, and soft tissue. Since clotting factors became available,  uncontrolled perioperative bleeding is a less significant problem for surgeons  in developed countries. However, they are more difficult to come by in China.  Additionally, patients often have to undergo surgery for giant masses and suffer  complications. We wanted to present our experience in the surgical management of hemophilic pseudotumors over a 40-year period. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 429 hemorrhagic coagulopathy patients  between 1983 and 2015. Diagnosis of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed following clinical, radiological, and pathological criteria. The data were  recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor,  etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare but well documented complication  seen in approximately 1-2% of patients with hemophilia. The incidence continues  to decrease, likely because of increasingly sophisticated techniques in managing factor deficiency. We present a case of hemophilic pseudotumor in a patient  without hemophilia, an exceptionally rare entity, and outline a hybrid approach  to treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient presented with a left sided iliopsoas mass and associated radiculopathy, with a history of a poorly characterized bleeding  diathesis and Noonan's syndrome. He had no history of trauma and was not being  treated with anti-coagulation. Of note, factors VIII, IX and XI were normal. An  ,  Context: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare, but well-known, complication of hemophilia. We  describe a 50-year-old man with mild hemophilia A, but with no previous need for  Factor VIII supplementation, who presented with a pathologic fracture of the  right femoral neck and shaft caused by a large hemophilic pseudotumor. Initial  nonoperative therapy with factor replacement and skeletal traction resulted in  radiographic evidence of fracture healing, but the patient's pain persisted.  Therefore, he had a radical resection of his hemophilic pseudotumor (soft tissue  component and entire femur), and reconstruction with a custom total femoral  replacement. Six months after resection, the patient returned to full-time employment. Although pseudotumor formation is a well-recognized complication of  hemophilia, the pseudotumor in our study is one of the largest yet described.  More importantly, to our knowledge this is the first report of a pseudotumor treated by radical resection and reconstruction with a custom femoral  prosthesis. We think that radical resection and reconstruction with a custom  total femoral prosthesis is a valuable alternative to amputation in massive  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Benign masseter muscle hypertrophy is an uncommon clinical  phenomenon of uncertain aetiology which is characterised by a soft swelling near  the angle of the mandible. The swelling may on occasion be associated with  facial pain and can be prominent enough to be considered cosmetically  disfiguring. Varying degrees of success have been reported for some of the  treatment options for masseter hypertrophy, which range from simple pharmacotherapy to more invasive surgical reduction. Injection of botulinum  toxin type A into the masseter muscle is generally considered a less invasive  modality and has been advocated for cosmetic sculpting of the lower face. Botulinum toxin type A is a powerful neurotoxin which is produced by the  anaerobic organism Clostridium botulinum and when injected into a muscle causes  interference with the neurotransmitter mechanism producing selective paralysis  ,  Context: lymphangiomyomatosis with serious hemoptysis.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus and corneal ectasia after LASIK are managed by the Athens Protocol.," Context: RESULTS: Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had  improved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance  visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. We  noted a similar outcome after similar treatment applied in the left eye with  UDVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this case, the introduction of successful management of severe  cornea abnormalities and scarring with the Athens Protocol may provide an  effective alternative to other existing surgical or medical options.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C.

UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous  melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence  in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors  include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular  melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases.  Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy,  phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination.

The PS of the fellow eye depended on viewing condition: it was  comparable to controls during binocular (log(10)BCEA = -0.77) and fellow eye  viewing (log(10)BCEA = -0.52), but it decreased during amblyopic eye viewing  (log(10)BCEA = 0.08). Patients exhibited binocular summation during fellow eye  viewing, but not during amblyopic eye viewing. Decrease in PS in patients was  mainly due to slow eye drifts.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor."," Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN  promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: The pro-oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively activated in a  wide variety of tumours that often become addicted to its activity, but no  unifying view of a core function determining this widespread STAT3-dependence  has yet emerged. We show here that constitutively active STAT3 acts as a master  regulator of cell metabolism, inducing aerobic glycolysis and down-regulating  mitochondrial activity both in primary fibroblasts and in STAT3-dependent tumour cell lines. As a result, cells are protected from apoptosis and senescence while  becoming highly sensitive to glucose deprivation. We show that enhanced  glycolysis is dependent on HIF-1α up-regulation, while reduced mitochondrial activity is HIF-1α-independent and likely caused by STAT3-mediated  down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins. The induction of aerobic glycolysis  is an important component of STAT3 pro-oncogenic activities, since inhibition of  ,  Context: was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3  signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either  metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance. We conclude that the  upregulation of Notch1 expression by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is an essential event in the development of hepatic insulin resistance in the presence  of excess amino acids. Activation of AMPK prevents amino acid-induced insulin  resistance through the suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling pathway.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Gait disturbances, dementia, and urinary incontinence."," Context: relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to  decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold. METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine  ,  Context: Suppurative intracranial infection, including meningitis, intracranial abscess,  subdural empyema, epidural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and thrombosis  of other dural sinuses, are uncommon sequelae of paranasal sinusitis. A high  index of suspicion is necessary to identify these serious complications. We  present a patient with subdural empyema in whom the diagnosis was delayed,  followed by a discussion of suppurative complications of sinusitis. The case shows the rapid progression of subdural empyema, which represents a true  neurosurgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with  iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA  ,  Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence.

Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context:  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, pseudotumor cerebri) is a syndrome of  elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause that occurs predominantly in  obese women of childbearing age. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and, therefore, other causes of increased intracranial pressure must be sought with history,  imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid examination before the diagnosis can be made.  IIH produces symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, including papilledema. If untreated, papilledema can cause progressive irreversible visual  loss and optic atrophy.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) during development. In fact, more than a thousand genes use different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context: The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by  sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise.

In this work, we investigated whether these modified  histones could similarly identify cis regulatory elements within the zebrafish  genome. By applying chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing,  we find that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are enriched at transcriptional start sites in  the genome of the developing zebrafish embryo and that this association  correlates with gene expression. We further find that these modifications  associate with distal non-coding conserved elements, including known active enhancers. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to utilize H3K4me1 and  H3K4me3 binding profiles in combination with available expression data to  computationally identify relevant cis regulatory sequences flanking syn-expressed genes in the developing embryo. Taken together, our results  indicate that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 generally mark cis regulatory elements within  the zebrafish genome and indicate that further characterization of the zebrafish  ,  Context: RESULTS: We used a unique combination of tools to obtain regional global-local  alignments of orthologous loci. This approach takes into account shuffling of  regulatory regions that are likely to occur over evolutionary distances greater  than those separating mammalian genomes. This approach revealed one order of  magnitude more vertebrate conserved elements than was previously reported in  over 2,000 genes, including a high number of genes found in the membrane and  extracellular regions. Our analysis revealed that 72% of the elements identified  have undergone shuffling. We tested the ability of the elements identified to  enhance transcription in zebrafish embryos and compared their activity with a set of control fragments. We found that more than 80% of the elements tested  were able to enhance transcription significantly, prevalently in a  tissue-restricted manner corresponding to the expression domain of the  neighboring gene.

However, she presented  with a more severe phenotype than her sibling or ancestors and was found to have a PMP22 triplication instead of the duplication.

CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context: Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene  cause either autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type  4A or autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with vocal cord  paresis.

We detected six distinct mutant alleles in four families, four of which are novel.  Electrophysiological studies show severely slowed motor nerve conduction  velocities with severely reduced compound muscle action potentials. However, one patient had a normal conduction velocity in the ulnar nerve.

The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context: The frequent occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) conferred by the  overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 in  cancer cells remains a therapeutic obstacle for scientists and clinicians.  Consequently, developing or identifying modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 that are  suitable for clinical practice is of great importance. Therefore, we have  explored the drug repositioning approach to identify candidate modulators of  ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological  properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that  avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor  receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and  ABCG2. Moreover, avapritinib restores the chemosensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. These findings  were further supported by results of apoptosis induction assays, ATP hydrolysis  assays, and docking of avapritinib in the drug-binding pockets of ABCB1 and  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: Avapritinib (AYVAKIT™) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of  platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop  mutants. It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Clinical development of  avapritinib is also underway for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis and late-stage solid tumours in several countries.  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNA (circRNA) functions as a master regulator of gene expression by sequestering or 'sponging' other gene expression regulators, particularly miRNAs. It also modulates transcription directly and influences cell-cell communication, tumorigenesis"," Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: It is now clear that there is a diversity of circular RNAs in biological  systems. Circular RNAs can be produced by the direct ligation of 5' and 3' ends  of linear RNAs, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, or by  ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of regulatory RNAs that despite being  relatively abundant have only recently begun to be explored. There are many  thousands of genes that appear capable of producing circRNAs, however the function of all but a handful remain to be determined. What is emerging about  these highly conserved molecules is that they play important roles in biology  and cancer biology in particular. The most explored function of circRNAs is as master regulators of gene expression that act to sequester or ´sponge´ other  gene expression regulators, in particular miRNAs. They have also been  demonstrated to function via direct modulation of transcription, and by  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to  suppress microRNAs, thereby increasing the translation and stability of the  targets of such microRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging functions of  circRNAs, including RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation. We  also discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function depending on the cell context, such as circRNA abundance, subcellular  localization, interacting partners (RNA, DNA, and proteins), dynamic changes in  interactions following stimulation, and potential circRNA translation. The ensuing changes in gene expression patterns elicited by circRNAs are proposed to  drive key cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and  survival, that govern health and disease.

They are also used to study protein conformational dynamics, image biological samples at high resolution, and create"," Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: of these complementary experimental approaches when seeking to understand  protein conformational dynamics. These methods are illustrated using a limited  set of examples including myoglobin and haemoglobin in complex with carbon  monoxide, the simple light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, and the  superoxide scavenger superoxide reductase. In conclusion, likely future  developments of these methods at synchrotron X-ray sources and the potential  impact of emerging X-ray free-electron laser facilities are speculated upon.  ,  Context: or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a  nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects  with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial  resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science  samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the  techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray  free-electron laser sources.  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context:  The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  ,  Context: Matter with a high energy density (>10(5) joules per cm(3)) is prevalent  throughout the Universe, being present in all types of stars and towards the  centre of the giant planets; it is also relevant for inertial confinement  fusion. Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure,  requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous  temperatures and densities. With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source  (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been investigated. An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray  interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for  applications.

It includes a series of rare complex and heterogenosis disorders. Alobar form is associated with an extremely poor fetal prognosis. Here we report  three cases of alobar holoprosencephaly and one case of semilobar  holoprosencephaly diagnosed at the third trimester. Causes, diagnosis and management of holoprosencephaly are discussed referring to literature.  ,  Context:  Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the  embryonic forebrain. It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can  range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case  series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in  case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted population-based studies. Using data from a population-based birth defects  registry in California, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical  characteristics of cytogenetically and phenotypically distinct types of  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of  ,  Context: (HPE) is a severe brain malformation characterized by abnormal cleavage of the  prosencephalon in the 5th gestational week. Aprosencephaly and atelencephaly  occur earlier because of failure in the formation of the prosencephalon and  telencephalon, respectively. The HPE holoprosencephaly spectrum classically  includes alobar, semilobar, and lobar forms, although there are no clear-cut  defining features. The middle interhemispheric variant (MIH), also known as  syntelencephaly, is classified as a variant of HPE holoprosencephaly with  midline interhemispheric fusion. Other conditions sometimes included in the  spectrum of HPE holoprosencephaly include septo-optic dysplasia (SOD); ""minimal"" HPE holoprosencephaly , which is associated with subtle craniofacial  malformations and mild developmental delay; and microform HPE holoprosencephaly  , which by definition excludes brain involvement. The focus of this article will be on the spectrum of findings visible in fetal manifestation of the HPE  holoprosencephaly spectrum.

The mother on antenatal follow-up was detected to have a fetus with multiple congenital anomalies on Ultrasonography (USG) done at 34weeks of  gestation. The baby died after 12 hours of birth. A complete autopsy was  performed. On external examination, multiple congenital anomalies were seen  ,  Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Holoprosencephaly is a disorder of forebrain development  characterized by a failure of the brain to separate into two hemispheres during  early development. It is now clear that many cases of holoprosencephaly are  caused by alterations in the genetic programmes that pattern the nervous system.  Less is known about how a holoprosencephalic brain either forms or fails to form  connections between various brain structures.  RECENT FINDINGS: Abnormalities in the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract,  medial lemniscus and cerebellar peduncles can be seen in holoprosencephaly.  Diffusion tensor imaging has been and will continue to be an important tool for imaging white matter in the brain, and will be reviewed here. Furthermore,  recent evidence suggests that holoprosencephaly can be associated with delays or  abnormalities in myelination. The functional implications of white matter abnormalities in children with holoprosencephaly is only beginning to be  understood.

Moreover, there was an excellent  clustering of Barrett's metaplasia (without dysplasia) tissues from normal  epithelium tissues. However, Barrett's esophagus tissues of different stages and  esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues were interspersed. There were differentially  expressed miRNAs at different stages.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,"TRalpha2 regulates T3 binding and cardiac myoblast differentiation in the heart. It also mitigates TRalpha1 effects, attenuating TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities."," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: similar to that in wild-type mice at room temperature. However, at  thermoneutrality, in which the regulation of heart rate switches from  sympathetic to parasympathetic in wild-type mice, TRalpha1+m mice maintained  sympathetic stimulation and failed to activate parasympathetic signaling. Our  findings demonstrate a novel role for TRalpha1 in the adaptation of cardiac  activity by the autonomic nervous system and suggest that human patients with a  similar mutation in TRalpha1 might exhibit a deficit in cardiac adaptation to  stress or physical activity and an increased sensitivity to beta-blockers.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood  vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis.  ,  Context: can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune  features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly  understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized  SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with  MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell  activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had  SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C  patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that  correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained  immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time,  concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures  that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation  and trajectory of MIS-C.  ,  Context: We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). This adolescent male  presented prior to any known association between COVID-19 and immune mediated  inflammatory syndrome in children. He presented in stable condition and without  significant multisystem involvement. During hospitalization, he developed severe  left ventricular dysfunction and mixed hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic  shock. Clinical features overlapped with Kawasaki disease, acute rheumatic  fever, and toxic shock syndrome. After centers in Europe began reporting a  multisystem inflammatory condition in children with COVID-19, the patient's clinical course and laboratory findings were revisited. He underwent newly  available antibody testing and was diagnosed as one of the first known cases of  MIS-C in the United States.  ,  Context:  Although there is still much that is not understood, experience with previous  coronavirus outbreaks and available data on COVID-19 indicate a reduced  propensity to affect children. Nonetheless, serious complications—although rare—are being seen in pediatric patients. This review, written with the  emergency medicine clinician in mind, describes the epidemiology, clinical  features, and management implications for COVID-19 in pediatric patients. It includes a discussion of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  associated with COVID-19, as well as other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that  are affecting children and families, such as poisonings, childhood  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Here we summarize current knowledge about multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a presumed postinfectious  inflammatory condition that has emerged as an important COVID-19-associated complication, to help clinicians identify and manage cases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentation of MIS-C is dominated by significant  inflammation. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension are common features. Kawasaki disease-like findings are common, but  epidemiologic data and recent mechanistic studies suggest that distinct  inflammatory pathways mediate Kawasaki disease and MIS-C.

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,"Yes, ubrogepant has been evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder involving neurogenic  inflammation and transmission of trigeminovascular nociceptive pathways mediated  by Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Several small molecules antagonizing  the CGRP receptor have been developed as migraine-specific acute medications.  The CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant, also known as MK-1602, has been  recently evaluated in phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura. EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  ,  Context: safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability.  RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to treatment. Four  cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases (one placebo, one  ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one (ubrogepant) probably related.  ,  Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use. Overall, there was no evidence of  ,  Context: Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been  submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, New Jersey) has recently published an integrated  strategy for implementation of dried blood spots (DBS) in late-stage trials for  population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. We applied this strategy for another  late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed  ,  Context: METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for 21 children with known  mutations of the TWIST (n=10) or the FGFR3 (n=11) genes.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola virus and Marburg virus are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context: Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an  anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug  functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus,  rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of  favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of  ,  Context:  SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different  geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah  virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not  match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV),  which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an  animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the  possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies.

This model is general enough to explore  the biological significance of Muller's ratchet in various species where its  operation has been suspected. For increased precision over a wide range of  parameter space I employ individual-based simulations run by evolution@home, the  first global computing system for evolutionary biology. After compiling  realistic values for the key parameters in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) I  find that a surprisingly large range of biologically realistic parameter  combinations would lead to the extinction of the human line over a period of 20 million years - if accepted wisdom about mtDNA and Muller's ratchet is correct.  The resulting genomic decay paradox complements a similar threat from extinction  due to mutation accumulation in nuclear DNA and suggests evaluation of unconventional explanations for long-term persistence.

The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine receptors.," Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context: severity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of  function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is  supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions.  Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug  Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome  and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for  longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in  disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept  in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept  is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring  weekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders  may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for  ","19649332, 33200890, 33229362, 32324502, 32562029, 22096352",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling. Microtubule composed  of tubulins regulates cell shape, migration and survival. Tubulin acetylation  has an important role in the control of microtubule structure and microtubule-based cellular functions. In this study, angiotensin II induced  disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment  with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using  RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin  II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method.  ,  Context: subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has  been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the  migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the transition of projection neurons from the multipolar stage to the  unipolar/bipolar stage in the intermediate zone of the cortex. Furthermore,  knockdown of α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 or overexpression of tubulin(K40Q) to mimic acetylated α-tubulin could reduce the migratory and morphological defects  caused by MEC-17 deficiency in cortical projection neurons. Thus, MEC-17, which  regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, appears to control the migration and  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ","12024216, 26227334, 23798680, 21677656, 22972992, 23126280","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214",,,,

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"No, TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages) are not good anticancer therapeutic targets as they promote tamoxifen resistance and accelerate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo by activating breast cancer cells through EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling"," Context: BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-negative breast cancer is clinically  aggressive and normally does not respond to conventional estrogen  target-directed therapies. The soybean isoflavone, genistein (GE), has been  shown to prevent and inhibit breast cancer and recent studies have suggested  that GE can enhance the anticancer capacity of an estrogen antagonist, tamoxifen  (TAM), especially in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. However, the role of GE in ERα-negative breast cancer remains unknown. METHODS: We have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo epigenetic effects of GE on  ERα reactivation by using MTT assay, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, western-blot assay, immunoprecipitation (ChIP)  assay, immunohistochemistry and epigenetic enzymatic activity analysis.  Preclinical mouse models including xenograft and spontaneous breast cancer mouse  ,  Context: administered by intramuscular injections that limit the total amount of drug  that can be administered and hence lead to the potential for incomplete receptor  blockade. We describe the identification and characterization of a series of  small-molecule, orally bioavailable SERDs which are potent antagonists and  degraders of ER-α and in which the ER-α degrading properties were prospectively  optimized. The lead compound 11l (GDC-0810 or ARN-810) demonstrates robust  activity in models of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer,  and is currently in clinical trials in women with locally advanced or metastatic  estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  ,  Context:  Tamoxifen, a pioneering selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has long  been a therapeutic choice for all stages of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive  breast cancer. The clinical application of long-term adjuvant antihormone therapy for the breast cancer has significantly improved breast cancer survival.  However, acquired resistance to SERM remains a significant challenge in breast  cancer treatment. The evolution of acquired resistance to SERMs treatment was primarily discovered using MCF-7 tumors transplanted in athymic mice to mimic  years of adjuvant treatment in patients. Acquired resistance to tamoxifen is  unique because the growth of resistant tumors is dependent on SERMs. It appears  ,  Context: Endocrine therapy is the standard treatment for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive  breast cancer, but tumors eventually develop resistance. However, endocrine  therapy resistance mechanisms mediated through interactions between breast  cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are still unclear. Here, we  characterized sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) overexpression drives the  highly glycolytic phenotype of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells where  enhanced lactic acid secretion promotes M2-like TAM polarization via the  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3  pathway. In turn, M2-like TAMs activate breast cancer cells through EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling, providing feedback to upregulate SGLT1 and promote  tamoxifen resistance and accelerate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Higher  expression of SGLT1 and CD163+ TAMs was associated with endocrine-resistant ER-positive breast cancers. Our study identifies a novel vicious cycle of  metabolic reprogramming, M2-like TAM polarization, and endocrine therapy  resistance, which involves SGLT1, proposing SGLT1 as a therapeutic target to  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and  brivanib alaninate, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)  inhibitor, are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease  in tumour growth when given alone. Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast  and endometrial tumour growth. Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have  side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both  agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive, oestrogen  stimulated tumour xenografts (MCF-7 E2 tumours). Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast (MCF-7 Tam, MCF-7 Ral) and  endometrial tumours (EnCa 101) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate  in SERM resistant models.  ,  Context: Agents that inhibit estrogen production, such as aromatase inhibitors or those  that directly block estrogen receptor (ER) activity, such as selective estrogen  receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor degraders, are routinely  used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. However, although initial  treatment with these agents is often successful, many women eventually relapse  with drug-resistant breast cancers. To overcome some of the challenges  associated with current endocrine therapies and to combat the development of  resistance, there is a need for more durable and more effective ER-targeted  therapies. Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its  therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD1901 selectively  binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, RAD1901 produced a robust and profound  inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft models. In an intracranial MCF-7  model, RAD1901-treated animals survived longer than those treated with either  ","23379261, 25879485, 24930824, 34006822, 20303261, 26164151",Therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional therapies has yielded promising results.,29594035,,,,
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes"," Context: Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to  ,  Context:  To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA treatment significantly  knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not  cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down  Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon  ,  Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context:  Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor  essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. To  elucidate the mechanism underlying Gfi1b function, potential downstream transcriptional targets were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and  expression profiling approaches. The combination of these approaches revealed  the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple  Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied  by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in  ,  Context:  Transcription factor Growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) is required for  multilineage blood cell development, from stem and progenitor cells to  differentiated lymphoid and myeloid cells. Gfi1 expression is rapidly induced by cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility.," Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/. CONTACTS: jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) on the histone modification data for known promoters  and enhancers, and then used the trained HMMs to identify promoter or enhancer  like sequences in the human genome. Using a simulated annealing (SA) procedure,  we searched for the most informative combination and the optimal window size of  histone marks. CONCLUSION: Compared with the previous methods, the HMM method can capture the  complex patterns of histone modifications particularly from the weak signals.  Cross validation and scanning the ENCODE regions showed that our method  outperforms the previous profile-based method in mapping promoters and  enhancers. We also showed that including more histone marks can further boost the performance of our method. This observation suggests that the HMM is robust  and is capable of integrating information from multiple histone marks. To  further demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we applied it to analyzing genome wide ChIP-Seq data in three mouse cell lines and correctly predicted  active and inactive promoters with positive predictive values of more than 80%.  The software is available at http://http:/nash.ucsd.edu/chromatin.tar.gz.  ,  Context: Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a prominent mechanism to generate protein  diversity, yet its regulation is poorly understood. We demonstrated a direct  role for histone modifications in alternative splicing. We found distinctive  histone modification signatures that correlate with the splicing outcome in a  set of human genes, and modulation of histone modifications causes splice site  switching. Histone marks affect splicing outcome by influencing the recruitment of splicing regulators via a chromatin-binding protein. These results outline an  adaptor system for the reading of histone marks by the pre-mRNA splicing  machinery.  ,  Context: analysis was performed on intact unfractionated histones within 19 min, which is  ∼3-fold faster than previously published procedures. High mass accuracy  measurements combined with top-down tandem mass spectrometry (MS) experiments  enable accurate histone identification. Experimental and biological variations  were thoroughly assessed and were 8% and 16% on average, respectively. With a  sample preparation reduced to the minimum, characterization of the most abundant  histones can be achieved in a single experiment. Semi-quantitative information  can be obtained with respect to the relative abundances of the detected isoforms  through a label-free approach. Isoform identities and relative distributions were further confirmed by the LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests. Overall, our  UHPLC-MS approach for histone profiling offers a sensitive and reproducible tool  that will be of great value for exploring PTMs and variants and can readily be applied to clinical or pharmaceutical studies.  ,  Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes.  ,  Context: accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report  a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining  sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various  open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks  (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF  affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures  of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding  sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to  the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a  good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by  TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq data sets. Finally, these scores correctly predict known  transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq  and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.

METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21).  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand, and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared. Data were  analyzed by repeated-measures one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test for finger  measurements and group comparisons and Pearson's and Spearman's tests for  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  ,  Context: Finger length ratio has been proposed as a putative marker for prenatal hormone  exposure, as well as the action of HOX, AR, and a variant of the LIN28b genes.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively.

Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current status of emerging therapies  for hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the United States.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is often associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In fact, a case report describes a 61-year-old man with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM"," Context: Cardiac involvement is frequent in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with dilated  cardiomyopathy and severe arrhythmias having been reported. Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular  disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and  intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients. Left ventricular non-compaction diagnosis is often overlooked. Neurological examination should be performed in all patients  with left ventricular non-compaction.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM). BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype. In  addition, INLVM with a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle, ventricular  dysfunction, and deep trabeculations, is also inherited, and the genes  ,  Context:  Cardiomyopathies are classified according to distinct morphological  characteristics. They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis. Aims Autosomal-dominant as well as X-linked inheritance for NCCM has been described and several loci have been associated with the disease.  Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.  Methods and Results We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by idiopathic  dilatation and systolic contractile dysfunction of the ventricle(s) leading to  an impaired systolic function. The origin of DCM is heterogeneous, but genetic  transmission of the disease accounts for up to 50% of the cases. Mutations in  alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), a thin filament protein involved in structural and  regulatory roles in muscle cells, are associated with hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy (HCM) and very rarely with DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present a large four-generation family in which DCM  is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Six family members have a cardiomyopathy with the age of diagnosis ranging from 5 months to 52 years. The  youngest affected was diagnosed with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy  (NCCM) and died at the age of five. Three additional children died young of suspected heart problems.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected  3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  employs the ability of Pol θ to tightly grasp a 3' terminus through unique  contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers.  Pol θ is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a  backup role in DNA base excision repair. POLQ is a member of a cluster of  similarly upregulated genes that are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancer types. Inhibition of  pol θ is a compelling approach for combination therapy of radiosensitization.  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize  ,  Context: mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,  including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the  C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase θ, illustrating two potential  modes of dimerization. One structure depicts insertion of ddATP opposite an  abasic-site analog during translesion DNA synthesis. The second structure  describes a cognate ddGTP complex. Polymerase θ uses a specialized thumb  subdomain to establish unique upstream contacts to the primer DNA strand,  including an interaction with the 3'-terminal phosphate from one of five  distinctive insertion loops. These observations demonstrate how polymerase θ grasps the primer to bypass DNA lesions or extend poorly annealed DNA termini to  mediate end-joining.  ,  Context: The CD6 protein has been shown to play important roles in T cell costimulation  and adhesion. Recently, variably spliced isoforms of CD6 mRNA have been  identified in both human and murine T cells. Here we report on the genomic  organization of the human CD6 gene, its chromosomal localization, and the  characterization of novel isoforms. Human CD6 is encoded by at least 13 exons.  The amino terminal signal sequence, extracellular region, and transmembrane  domain are encoded by seven exons, while the cytoplasmic domain of CD6 is  encoded by six exons. Each of the three extracellular scavenger receptor  cysteine-rich domains is encoded by a separate exon. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and screening of a chromosome-specific YAC (yeast  artificial chromosome) library revealed that the gene encoding CD6 is located on  chromosome 11 at 11q13 in close proximity to the gene encoding the related molecule CD5 and within 600 kb of CD20. Analysis of mRNA transcripts encoding  CD6 isolated from mitogen-activated PBMC and from B cells obtained from patients  with chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed the presence of at least five  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. Additionally, Rif1 interacts"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  ,  Context: development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo  fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. RNA  interference to human Rif1 decreases the efficiency of homology-directed repair  (HDR), and Rif1 deficiency results in aberrant aggregates of the HDR factor  Rad51. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric  heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the  repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR.

DHX36 is a multi-functional helicase that has  been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and  post-transcriptional regulation, and is essential for heart development,  haematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice9-12. Here we report the co-crystal  structure of bovine DHX36 bound to a DNA with a G-quadruplex and a 3'  single-stranded DNA segment. We show that the N-terminal DHX36-specific motif folds into a DNA-binding-induced α-helix that, together with the OB-fold-like  subdomain, selectively binds parallel G-quadruplexes. Comparison with unliganded  and ATP-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that  G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by  pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex  structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s.  Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4  ,  Context:  The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to  maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation  initiation.

A fundamental  mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4  substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward G4-targeted therapies.

To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, Cseq-Simulator was developed as a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset.",26776207,,,,
What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: site. In this paper we analyse the mode of action of this element. We show that  protein binding occurs at the TCE after incubation with testis protein extracts  from Drosophila melanogaster. While several proteins are associated with the  translational control element in the RNA, only one of these proteins directly  crosslinks to the sequence element. The binding activity is exclusively observed  with testis protein extracts but can be demonstrated with testis extracts from  other Drosophila species as well, indicating that regulatory proteins involved  in translational regulation in the male germ line are conserved. Although  binding to the TCE can occur independent of its position relative to the transcription start site of the in vitro transcripts, its function in vivo is  not exerted when shifted further downstream within the 5' UTR of a fusion gene.  In addition to being a translational control element the TCE also functions as a transcriptional regulator. Consequently, a DNA-protein complex is also formed at  the TCE. In contrast to the RNA-protein complexes we find DNA-protein complexes  with protein extracts of several tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.  ,  Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan  ,  Context: family exert diverse physiological functions and amongst eukaryotes appear to be  restricted to the order Insecta. MRJPs constitute about 90% of total protein of  royal jelly, which is secreted by nurse bees to feed the queen and growing  larvae. We looked for mrjp and yellow homologues in a honeybee brain expressed  sequence tags (EST) library. In addition to the five mrjp cDNAs previously  characterized, we found three additional cDNAs encoding novel MRJPs and  importantly, two cDNAs coding for orthologues of Drosophila yellow proteins. One  yellow cDNA and all three cDNAs coding for the novel MRJPs were assembled  completely, the sequence of the other yellow homologue was partially assembled. The data we present here supports the view that repeated duplications and  functional divergence occurred during the evolution of MRJPs in honeybees, with  even closely related MRJPs appearing to perform diverse physiological functions. Conversely, yellow protein orthologues appear to be conserved and thus  candidates for maintaining the former function(s) of yellow proteins.  ,  Context: Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to  mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. We  describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE  information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and  splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main  types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins. Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits  were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for  editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts  are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely  membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological  ,  Context: Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal LIM-only protein expressed in  striated muscle. Mutations in human MLP are associated with cardiomyopathy;  however, the molecular mechanism by which MLP functions is not established. A  Drosophila MLP homolog, mlp84B, displays many of the same features as the  vertebrate protein, illustrating the utility of the fly for the study of MLP  function. Animals lacking Mlp84B develop into larvae with a morphologically intact musculature, but the mutants arrest during pupation with impaired muscle  function. Mlp84B displays muscle-specific expression and is a component of the  Z-disc and nucleus. Preventing nuclear retention of Mlp84B does not affect its function, indicating that Mlp84B site of action is likely to be at the Z-disc.  Within the Z-disc, Mlp84B is colocalized with the N-terminus of D-titin, a  protein crucial for sarcomere organization and stretch mechanics.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Diuretics, bisphosphonates, imatinib, iron, antacids, catecholamines, platinum-containing anticancer drugs, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal"," Context: Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia  frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: were confirmed.

He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake.

DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary  literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected. Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  ,  Context: abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.  ,  Context: Although most hypothyroid patients do well with one single tablet of thyroxine  daily, approximately 10% are dissatisfied and another important group of  patients is difficult to control. We reviewed the most common causes for  frequent-dose adjustment or high-dose requirement, including poor compliance  with therapy and inadequate medication. Since these two causes have been ruled  out, drug interaction and other concomitant diseases need to be investigated. Requirements of thyroxine increase in all conditions characterized by impaired  gastric acid secretion. Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of  drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption. In addition, a series of diseases including celiac disease and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, as well  as nutritional habits may be important in patient control.

The radiographic data pre- and post-treatment showed that nicotinamide did  not reverse the calcification. However, the treatment retarded calcification  growth after 4weeks, while in the untreated animals, calcifications increased in  size. The therapy did not affect serum phosphate levels, but intact Fgf23  decreased in the treated mice. The treated mice also had increased calcium in  the heart. In summary, nicotinamide did not alter serum phosphate levels, likely  due to compensatory decrease in Fgf23 to counteract the phosphate lowering  effect of nicotinamide. Although increased calcium accumulation in the heart is a concern, the therapy appears to slow down the progression of ectopic  calcifications.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"Yes, H4K20 methylation is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains during DNA replication. Depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in accumulation of DNA damage specifically limited to late replic"," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity. Aberrant rereplication correlates  with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation  (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse  embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or  cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an  artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC)  in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20  methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding  properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in  higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: Enhancers play a pivotal role in regulating the transcription of distal genes.  Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300  and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a  fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such  as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from  inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most  informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking.  Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative  approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we  develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between  chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a  combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA  transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.  ,  Context: start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during  subsequent cell divisions. Thus, we suggest that once the H3K27me3 is  established, it recruits the PRC2 complex to maintain the mark at sites of DNA  replication, leading to methylation of H3K27 on the daughter strands during  incorporation of newly synthesized histones. This mechanism ensures maintenance  of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark in proliferating cells, not only during DNA  replication when histones synthesized de novo are incorporated, but also outside  S phase, thereby preserving chromatin structure and transcriptional programs.

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome  and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport  channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the  ,  Context: 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context:  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb, Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR.

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent reports suggest that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods. In fact, tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites have been found in these species."," Context: RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded  by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many  eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral  protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  ,  Context:  RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single Avandamet pill.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Dosage  ,  Context: Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with  significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was reached  in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.1 mmol/L was reached in  26.97% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 19.33% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of FPG ≤7.0 mmol/L was reached in 63.16% of patients in  Avandamet treatment and 43.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. Fasting  insulin decreased 3.24 ± 0.98 μU/ml from baseline in Avandamet treatment and  0.72 ± 1.10 μU/ml in uptitrated metformin treatment. Overall adverse event (AE) rates and serious AE rates were similar between groups. Hypoglycaemia occurred  rarely in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with uptitrated metformin, Avandamet treatment provided significant improvements in key parameters of glycemic control and was generally  well tolerated. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-TRC-13003776.  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: diabetes mellitus (DM) aged 62.4 +/- 7.7 years comprised tests for blood levels  of leptin, soluble receptor to leptin, insulin, grelin, resistin and  adiponectine. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in reduction of fasting glycemia from 10.69 +/-  2.54 to 8.42 +/- 1.73 mmol/l, of glycosilated hemoglobin--from 8.1 + 1.6 to  7.75%, immunoreactive insulin--from 19.1 +/- 8.3 to 12.0 +/- 6.5 mg/ml,  grelin--from 21.7 +/- 14.6 to 17.3 +/- 13.7 mg/ml, leptin--from 40.3 +/- 24.2 to  26.9 +/- 15.4 mg/ml, soluble receptor to leptin--from 17.9 +/- 4.5 to 13.1 +/-  3.5 mg/ml. LDLP and HDLP cholesterol was high. CONCLUSION: Avandia and avandamet are effective antidiabetic drugs with a beneficial effect on secretion of fat tissue hormones.  ,  Context: considered clinically relevant (GMR, 113.94%; 90% CI, 99.33-130.70). All  treatments were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse  events leading to discontinuation in any of the studies.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by employing a mechanism of action distinct from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors, bifunctional oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory  elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.  We propose ExSpeU1s as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct, in several human disorders, different types of splicing mutations associated with defective exon  definition.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context: CaP and 2 cell lines. Micro RNAs were isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation  kit and cDNA was obtained using the TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription kit to  the miRNAs: hsa-miR-let7c, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-25,  hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-191,  hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-218. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out  using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master  Mix. miRNA expression levels were measured by relative quantification, and fold  expression changes were determined by the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. The small nucleolar  RNA RNU43 was used as an endogenous control. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs  significantly changed during the progression of CaP. Interestingly, there was a  significant global loss of miRNA expression between HGPIN and metastasis at 2 important steps. The first was related to the transition from HGPIN to invasive  adenocarcinoma, and the second was related to the transition from localized to  metastatic adenocarcinomas.  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show  that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217,  including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed  ,  Context: scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly  progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well  into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria  is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed  Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal  posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations  found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%).  Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways. Potential  therapeutic strategies are developed along these lines and include RNA interference techniques and inhibition of the dominant-negative influence of  abnormally formed Lamin A on polymerization with normally formed Lamin A.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased  risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.  ,  Context: Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class  treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This  also included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species  excreted in urine. Volanesorsen is highly bound to plasma proteins that are similar in mice, monkeys, and humans. In all species, plasma concentrations  declined in a multiphasic fashion, characterized by a relatively fast initial  distribution phase and then a much slower terminal elimination phase following  ,  Context: have resulted in vaccine programs for severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, some individuals remain at high risk for  the progression of COVID-19. In the US, the FDA has given Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA) for two neutralizing therapeutic monoclonal antibody  'cocktails,' casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV), bamlanivimab and etesevimab,  and one monotherapy, bamlanivimab, for prophylactic post-exposure therapy in  individuals at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Preclinical and  clinical studies showed consistent effectiveness of REGEN-COV against current  variants of SARS-CoV-2. On 21st November 2020, the FDA approved an initial EUA for REGEN-COV to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and in children 12  years or older with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at high risk for progression to  severe COVID-19. On 30th July 2021, the FDA updated its EUA for REGEN-COV for emergency use as post-exposure prophylactic to prevent COVID-19 progression in  adults and children aged 12 years or older.

The survey included questions about patients'  experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of  222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from  baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry  about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school  responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social,  and professional life were also reported.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) mRNA was detected in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined, and GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was expressed in nine of 14 NSCLC cell lines."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.  Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However,  ,  Context: significantly lower (p = 0.004) and auras (p = 0.005) were significantly less  frequently reported. Epigastric auras (p = 0.04) and febrile seizures (p =  0.025) occurred significantly less frequently in patients with FCD type 2  without HS compared to FCD type 3a. The diagnosis of an FCD was significantly  more frequently made (p = 0.03) by visual inspection of the MRI compared to FCD  type 1. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical features did not allow to clear separation of temporal  FCD types 1 and 3a. Statistically significant differences were seen in a history  of febrile seizures and the occurrence of auras more common in FCD type 3a.  However, FCD type 2 in the same localization but with different histology presented with further differences such as more frequent FCD diagnosis by visual  inspection of MRI, earlier operation, and less frequent epigastric auras.  ,  Context: ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it  has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that  PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and is  essential for proper GCase activity. GCase activity is significantly reduced in  tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced  lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of  GRN-related FTLD and NCL.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context:  We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  ,  Context: To maintain genomic integrity, DNA repair enzymes continually remove damaged  bases and lesions resulting from endogenous and exogenous processes. These  repair enzymes must distinguish damaged bases from normal bases to prevent the  inadvertent removal of normal bases, which would promote genomic instability.  The mechanisms by which this high level of specificity is accomplished are as  yet unresolved. One member of the uracil-DNA glycosylase family of repair enzymes, Escherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (Mug), is  reported to distinguish U:G mispairs from U:A base pairs based upon specific  contacts with the mispaired guanine after flipping the target uracil out of the duplex. However, recent studies suggest other mechanisms for base selection,  including local duplex stability. In this study, we used the modified base  N6-methyladenine to probe the effect of local helix perturbation on Mug  ,  Context:  A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962  explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different  bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,Mitofusin 2 and Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I.," Context: disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type  B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated  with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth  neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance.

Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease.

We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2  to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia,  Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus. In  transiently transfected cell lines, mutations of DNM2 substantially diminish  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular  atrophy (dSMA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized almost  exclusively by degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal  part of the limbs.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to provide iodine to the population for different purposes, including protecting against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes during nuclear reactor accidents."," Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  ,  Context: radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: With the global improvement of iodine nutrition, iodine excess is  emerging as a new concern. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to illustrate the physiological effects and potential molecular mechanisms of excessive iodine intake on lipid  metabolism. METHODS: Balb/c mice were given drinking water containing different levels of  iodine for 1 month and treated with 1.2 microg/mL iodine for different periods of time, respectively. Plasma lipid parameters and serum thyroid hormones were  measured. Expressions of hepatic genes were detected by real-time polymerase  chain reactions and Western blot.  ,  Context: nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the  interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in  existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated  release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again  recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine  thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed  systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can  be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is  negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be  considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the  replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake  is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine  release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up  ,  Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause Usher syndrome type 2C.," Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: The congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolonged QT  intervals, QT interval lability, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The  manifestations of the disease vary, with a high incidence of sudden death in  some affected families but not in others. Mutations causing LQTS have been  identified in three genes, each encoding a cardiac ion channel. In families  linked to chromosome 3, mutations in SCN5A, the gene encoding the human cardiac  sodium channel, cause the disease, Mutations in the human ether-à-go-go-related  gene (HERG), which encodes a delayed-rectifier potassium channel, cause the  disease in families linked to chromosome 7. Among affected individuals in families linked to chromosome 11, mutations have been identified in KVLQT1, a  newly cloned gene that appears to encode a potassium channel. The SCN5A  mutations result in defective sodium channel inactivation, whereas HERG mutations result in decreased outward potassium current. Either mutation would  decrease net outward current during repolarization and would thereby account for  prolonged QT intervals on the surface ECG. Preliminary data suggest that the  ,  Context: Massively parallel sequencing identifies pathogenic variants in the genes  affected in Alport syndrome (COL4A3-COL4A5) in as many as 30% of individuals  with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 10% of those with kidney  failure of unknown cause, and 20% with familial immunoglobulin A (IgA)  glomerulonephritis. FSGS associated with COL4A3-COL4A5 variants is usually  present by the onset of kidney failure and may develop because the abnormal  glomerular membranes result in podocyte loss and secondary hyperfiltration. The  association of COL4A3-COL4A5 variants with kidney failure or IgA  glomerulonephritis may be coincidental. However, pathogenic variants in these conditions occur more often than they should by chance, which suggests that the  variants are disease-causing. COL4A3-COL4A5 variants are also found in cystic  kidney diseases after autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has been excluded. COL4A3-COL4A5 variants should be suspected in individuals with FSGS,  kidney failure of unknown cause, or familial IgA glomerulonephritis, especially  where there is persistent hematuria and a family history of hematuria or kidney  failure.  ,  Context: public use at the HapMap website. This site, which is the primary portal to  genotype data produced by the project, offers bulk downloads of the data set, as  well as interactive data browsing and analysis tools that are not available  elsewhere. Research into the genetic contributions to a human disease commonly  focuses on candidate genes identified from linkage and/or association studies,  as well as from pathways suspected to be involved in a particular disease  process. In studying candidate genes, a researcher will want to know whether  there are any common SNPs in the immediate vicinity, what those SNPs' alleles  are, and the relative frequencies of the alleles in the population. The researcher will also be particularly interested in coding SNPs, whose alleles  change the amino acid sequence of the gene product and therefore might represent  functional variations. This protocol provides details on how to use the genome browser to navigate to and explore HapMap data for a gene or region of interest.  ,  Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex contains multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70. However, a stable endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both Med220 and Med70 subunits has been isolated."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of  RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and  functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator  complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex  failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference  between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence.  Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals  a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP  or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16 activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator  functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA  Pol II via the CTD.  ,  Context: structural and functional relationships remain unknown. Here, we report that  affinity-purified ARC consists of two distinct multisubunit complexes: a larger  complex, denoted ARC-L, and a smaller coactivator, CRSP. Reconstituted in vitro  transcription with biochemically separated ARC-L and CRSP reveals differential  cofactor functions. The ARC-L complex is transcriptionally inactive, whereas the  CRSP complex is highly active. Structural determination by electron microscopy  (EM) and three-dimensional reconstruction indicate substantial differences in  size and shape between ARC-L and CRSP. Moreover, EM analysis of independently  derived CRSP complexes reveals distinct conformations induced by different activators. These results suggest that CRSP may potentiate transcription via  specific activator-induced conformational changes.  ,  Context: C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin  family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute  inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker  of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that  CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a  native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury  it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells  and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric  subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both  classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q  and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte  recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T  cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density  ,  Context: complex depends upon interactions between hCtf4 and multiple components of the  hCMG complex. The hCtf4-CMG complex, like the hCMG complex, contains DNA  helicase activity that is more salt-resistant than the helicase activity of the  hCMG complex. We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric  hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts  as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex. The role of the hCMG  complex as the core of the replisome is also discussed.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs have been found in several fungi and Gram-positive pathogens, contributing to their adhesion and virulence."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: fluorophore-HD5 conjugate family. By employing these peptides, we demonstrate  that fluorophore-HD5ox conjugates harboring the rhodamine and coumarin  fluorophores enter the E. coli cytoplasm. On the basis of the fluorescence  profiles, each of these fluorophore-HD5ox conjugates localizes to the site of  cell division and cell poles. These studies support the notion that HD5ox, at  least in part, exerts its antibacterial activity against E. coli and other  Gram-negative microbes in the cytoplasm.  ,  Context: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (EC 1.2.1.12) is an anchorless,  multifunctional protein displayed on the surface of several fungi and  Gram-positive pathogens, which contributes to their adhesion and virulence. To  date a role for extracellular GAPDH in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative  bacteria has not been described. The aim of this study was to analyze the  extracellular localization of GAPDH in enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) and  enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli strains and to examine its interaction  with host components that could be related to the infection mechanism.  Recombinant E. coli GAPDH was purified and polyclonal antibodies were obtained. Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on  the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC  strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme.  Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional  electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two  ,  Context:  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and can be found in cell  culture supernatants and biofluids. EVs carry proteins, nucleic acids, and other  cellular components and can deliver these to nearby or distant cells, making EVs of interest as both disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. EVs in biofluids  are heterogeneous, coming from different cell types and from different sources  with the cell, which limits the usefulness of bulk EV analysis methods that report the average features of all EVs present.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically the α2 isoform of AMPK."," Context: domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for  mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.  ,  Context: Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins  that form when translation initiation is inhibited. Stress granules are thought  to form by protein-protein interactions of RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate  RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK  ,  Context: Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast  cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal domain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear  localization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of  cyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways. Hence, RSK2 is a  ,  Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN.

While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is involved in transcriptional regulation, specifically in the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in certain tumors and activated macrophages."," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: events that occurred during evolution of the phylum Chordata, including two  rounds at about the origin of the subphylum Vertebrata (R1 and R2) and one round  before the teleost radiation (R3). Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such  genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes.  Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the  mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where  holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is  altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1  exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context: exosome? What is the detailed structure of exosome subunits? What are the  mechanisms by which the exosome is recruited to substrate RNAs? Here, we  summarize the current knowledge on the composition and architecture of this  complex, explain its role in both the production and degradation of various  types of RNA molecules and discuss the implications of recent research  developments that shed some light on the questions above and the mechanisms that  are controlling the exosome.  ,  Context: Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a  crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  Recently, new roles for succinate outside metabolism have emerged. Succinate  stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in  specific tumors and in activated macrophages, and stimulates dendritic cells via  its receptor succinate receptor 1. Furthermore, succinate has been shown to post-translationally modify proteins. This expanding repertoire of functions for  succinate suggests a broader role in cellular activation. We review the new  roles of succinate and draw parallels to other metabolites such as NAD(+) and citrate whose roles have expanded beyond metabolism and into signaling.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function impairs Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.," Context: Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) belongs to a  secreted and membrane-tethered multidomain SCUBE protein family composed of  three members found in vertebrates and mammals. Recent reports suggested that  zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle. However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: Dravet syndrome is one of the most severe epilepsy syndromes of early childhood,  and it comes with very high morbidity and mortality. The typical presentation is  characterized by hemiclonic or generalized clonic seizures triggered by fever  during the first year of life, followed by myoclonic, absence, focal and  generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Non-convulsive status epilepticus and  epileptic encephalopathy are common. Development is normal in the first year of  life, but most individuals eventually suffer from intellectual impairment.  Dravet syndrome is associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha1  subunit gene (SCN1A) in 70-80% of individuals. SCN1A mutation results in inhibition of the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, leading to excessive  neuronal excitation. The ""interneuron hypothesis"" is the current most accepted  pathophysiological mechanism of Dravet syndrome. The mortality rate is increased significantly in Dravet syndrome. Ataxia, a characteristic crouched gait and  Parkinson's symptoms may develop in some individuals. It is likely that Dravet  syndrome is underdiagnosed in adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Early  ,  Context: both as targets for modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)  protein and as catalytic components of the SUMO conjugation pathway. We have  found that the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 binds to Scm and that this  interaction, which requires the Scm C-terminal sterile α motif (SAM) domain, is  crucial for the efficient sumoylation of Scm. Scm is associated with the major  Polycomb response element (PRE) of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and  efficient PRE recruitment requires an intact Scm SAM domain. Global reduction of  sumoylation augments binding of Scm to the PRE. This is likely to be a direct  effect of Scm sumoylation because mutations in the SUMO acceptor sites in Scm enhance its recruitment to the PRE, whereas translational fusion of SUMO to the  Scm N terminus interferes with this recruitment. In the metathorax, Ubx  expression promotes haltere formation and suppresses wing development. When SUMO levels are reduced, we observe decreased expression of Ubx and partial  haltere-to-wing transformation phenotypes. These observations suggest that SUMO  negatively regulates Scm function by impeding its recruitment to the Ubx major  PRE.  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: most common type of CMT and was the first form of CMT in which a causative gene  was described. This review provides an up-to-date overview of AD CMT1  concentrating on the molecular genetics as the clinical, neurophysiological, and  pathological features have been covered elsewhere. Four genes (PMP22, MPZ,  LITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI  and a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also  cause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria). Studies have shown many of these  genes, when mutated, can cause a wide range of CMT phenotypes from the  relatively mild CMT1 to the more severe Dejerine-Sottas disease and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, and even in some cases axonal CMT2. This review  discusses what is known about these genes and in particular how they cause a  peripheral neuropathy, when mutated.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express folate receptor-alpha (FRα). It is also used," Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those  analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering  orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive  effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is  granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan  drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient  for the treatment of a common indication.  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis. There are still  concerns about the long term safety of TNF antagonists in the pediatric age  group and unanswered questions about increased risks of malignancy and  ,  Context: Selective heart rate (HR) reduction by I(f)-channel inhibition is a recently  developed pharmacological principle in cardiovascular therapy. Among these newly  identified HR-lowering drugs, only ivabradine has now become approved for  clinical use. I(f)-channel inhibition mainly reduces HR, thereby improving  myocardial oxygen supply, energy balance, and cardiac function. Ivabradine was  well tolerated and revealed a good safety profile in the investigated study  populations. The guiding experimental and clinical results of I(f)-channel  inhibition were compared to those of beta-blockade as a HR reducing principle as  well as cornerstone of heart failure standard therapy. Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits  beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well. Therefore,  hemodynamic effects of ivabradine and its limitations in heart failure together with the biological impact of HR reduction will be considered in this context.  Because no clinical data with specific heart-rate-reducing agents are available  in heart failure patients until now, the prospective significance of  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Through binding to folate receptor-β (FR-β), the new (99m)Tc-EC20  (Etarfolatide) imaging technique detects activated but not resting macrophages  in vivo. The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related  inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole  body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored  blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain  severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and employed repeated measures to adjust for correlation between knees. DESIGN: Activated macrophages were present in the majority (76%) of knees. The  quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including  joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66,  P = 0.001).

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Childhood brain tumor diagnoses are stressful for families. Children  diagnosed with craniopharyngioma (Cp) present with particularly challenging  medical and cognitive problems due to tumor location and associated  biophysiologic comorbidities. This study examined parental distress in a sample  of families of patients with Cp treated with proton beam therapy to identify  factors for targeting psychological intervention.  PROCEDURE: Prior to (n = 96) and 1 year after (n = 73) proton therapy, parents  of children diagnosed with Cp (9.81 ± 4.42 years at baseline; 49% male)  completed a self-report measure of distress, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Children completed cognitive assessment measures at baseline; medical variables  were extracted from the study database.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a paediatric neurodegenerative disease."," Context: Cerliponase alfa (Brineura™) is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase-1  (TPP1) being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. for use in patients with  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a paediatric neurodegenerative  disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an  enzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes progressive dementia in children. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of  intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was  initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received  the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a  ,  Context: Mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal membrane protein, are  responsible for the neurodegenerative disorder juvenile Batten disease. A  previous study on the yeast homolog to CLN3, designated Btn1p, revealed a  potential role for CLN3 in the transport of arginine into the yeast vacuole, the  equivalent organelle to the mammalian lysosome. Lysosomes isolated from  lymphoblast cell lines, established from individuals with juvenile Batten disease-bearing mutations in CLN3, but not age-matched controls, demonstrate  defective transport of arginine. Furthermore, we show that there is a depletion  of arginine in cells derived from individuals with juvenile Batten disease. We have, therefore, characterized lysosomal arginine transport in normal lysosomes  and show that it is ATP-, v-ATPase- and cationic-dependent. This and previous  studies have shown that both arginine and lysine are transported by the same  ,  Context:  Treatment with intracerebroventricular (ICV)-delivered cerliponase alfa enzyme  replacement therapy (ERT) in a Phase 1/2 study of 24 subjects with CLN2 disease  resulted in a meaningful preservation of motor and language (ML) function and was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of 96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported.

Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over  another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a  lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative  treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however,  these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype  evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing  profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy  is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for  symptom management. CONCLUSION: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for treating type 1 Gaucher disease and substrate replacement therapy may be considered in patients who do  not tolerate or cannot receive enzyme replacement therapy.  ,  Context: reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies  included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme  replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher  disease.

Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  aggregates during sequential printing cycles.

Taken together, these data strongly support the feasibility of the  proposed novel organ-printing technology.  ,  Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: A systematic characterisation of bone tissue scaffolds fabricated via 3D  printing from hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVOH) composite  powders is presented. Flowability of HA:PVOH precursor materials was observed to  affect mechanical stability, microstructure and porosity of 3D printed  scaffolds. Anisotropic behaviour of constructs and part failure at the  boundaries of interlayer bonds was highlighted by compressive strength testing.  A trade-off between the ability to facilitate removal of PVOH thermal  degradation products during sintering and the compressive strength of green  parts was revealed. The ultimate compressive strength of 55% porous green scaffolds printed along the Y-axis and dried in a vacuum oven for 6h was 0.88 ±  0.02 MPa. Critically, the pores of 3D printed constructs could be user designed,  ensuring bulk interconnectivity, and the imperfect packing of powder particles created an inherent surface roughness and non-designed porosity within the  scaffold. These features are considered promising since they are known to  facilitate osteoconduction and osteointegration in-vivo. Characterisation  ,  Context:  The capability to print three-dimensional (3D) cellular tubes is not only a  logical first step towards successful organ printing but also a critical  indicator of the feasibility of the envisioned organ printing technology. A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with  an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular  tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even  after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data.

Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: whole-genome duplication. Detection and study of duplications are usually based  on sequence alignment, synteny and phylogenetic techniques, but protein domains  are also useful in assessing protein homology. We develop a simple and  computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on  the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and  the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the  yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD  paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard  functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a  common set of ""duplicable"" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs  tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the  existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with  largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the  ,  Context:  An increasing number of studies report that functional divergence in duplicated  genes is accompanied by gene expression changes, although the evolutionary  mechanism behind this process remains unclear. Our genomic analysis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that the number of shared regulatory motifs in  the duplicates decreases with evolutionary time, whereas the total number of  regulatory motifs remains unchanged. Moreover, genes with numerous paralogs in the yeast genome do not have especially low number of regulatory motifs. These  findings indicate that degenerative complementation is not the sole mechanism  behind expression divergence in yeast. Moreover, we found some evidence for the  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of laryngeal cancer origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: The basis set of protein forms expressed by human cells from the H2B gene family  was determined by Top Down Mass Spectrometry. Using Electron Capture  Dissociation for MS/MS of H2B isoforms, direct evidence for the expression of  unmodified H2B.Q, H2B.A, H2B.K/T, H2B.J, H2B.E, H2B.B, H2B.F, and monoacetylated  H2B.A was obtained from asynchronous HeLa cells. H2B.A was the most abundant  form, with the overall expression profile not changing significantly in cells arrested in mitosis by colchicine or during mid-S, mid-G2, G2/M, and mid-G1  phases of the cell cycle. Modest hyperacetylation of H2B family members was  observed after sodium butyrate treatment.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients  with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have  refractory disease. This study aims at investigating the antitumor,  antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic activities of dovitinib in preclinical  models of HCC. METHODS: 21-0208 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the antitumor effect of dovitinib. Changes of biomarkers  relevant to FGFR/VEGFR/PDGFR pathways were determined by Western blotting.  Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with dovitinib resulted in G2/M cell cycle  arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and blockade of bFGF-induced  cell migration. Dovitinib inhibited basal expression and FGF-induced  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: Many genomic disorders occur as a result of chromosome rearrangements involving  low-copy repeats (LCRs). To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome  rearrangements, including translocations, we have investigated the mechanism of  evolutionary rearrangements. In contrast to several intrachromosomal  rearrangements, only two evolutionary translocations have been identified by  cytogenetic analyses of humans and greater apes. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas  chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal  translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to  characterize the breakpoints of the latter translocation at the molecular level.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is a minor complication associated with dental implant placement, as seen in one patient who developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure. Additionally, another study mentions that only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported during cortic"," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs,  representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (p < .05).  RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the  study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment,  hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus,  and mobility. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated  with implant loss.  ,  Context: Myasthenia gravis is a chronic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscular  weakness and fatigability. Dental management of patients diagnosed with  myasthenia gravis presents a challenge to the dental profession. A MEDLINE  search of the English medical (limited to provision in dental care) and dental  literature on myasthenia gravis and dental management published between 1975 and  2004 was conducted. In the dental literature, 12 articles were found, and only a few focused on myasthenia gravis and dental care. The purpose of this article  was to review and summarize the clinical signs and symptoms associated with  myasthenia gravis, highlighting the role of the dental profession in the process of the diagnosis and management of the oral and dental complications that might  be associated with the disease, while avoiding myasthenic crisis.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, AGY cannot be used as an antidiuretic replacement therapy. In patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD), AGY was associated with lowered lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LMER), but its effect on"," Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for  ,  Context: Nine active neurohypophyseal principles have been isolated and identified among  the vertebrates. Arginine-vasotocin is the most ubiquitous, occurring in  pituitary glands from representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. There  is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is  ,  Context: heart failure they are used for the treatment of swellings and shortness of  breath. The most frequently prescribed group of diuretics is thiazides and  similar products. In patients with renal insufficiency, loop diuretics are  administered. In the case of hypertension, diuretics are mainly used in the  combination treatment. The most frequently used diuretic in combination is again  hydrochlorothiazide, which is combined with reninangiotensin system blockers. It  is mainly the combination of an ACE inhibitor + indapamide that seems to be  modern and promising, and it is, on the basis of large clinical trials,  recommended also for diabetics (ADVANCE) or for secondary prevention following a cerebrovascular accident (PROGRESS) or for the elderly (HYVET). Also a  combination of two diuretics is popular -  mainly hydrochlorothiazide +  amiloride. A combination of a betablocker and diuretic is less suitable.  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context: Less than 1% of breast cancers occur in males, and the optimal hormonal therapy  in this setting is unknown. Tamoxifen is effective in this entity, but  unfortunately there is little information on aromatase inhibitors (AI) or  fulvestrant. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues  and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and  therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). In this report  we report 11 months of progression-free survival, without any adverse events, in  a patient who received trastuzumab and anastrozole therapy. We conclude that this combination is a reasonable option in men with ER+ and Her2+ advanced  breast cancer.  ,  Context: SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial failed to show a reduction of blood pressure after  catheter-based renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension. Kidney  injury in patients with heart failure was previously considered to result from  arterial underfilling due to low cardiac output, but the role of renal venous  hypertension in this process has also recently been investigated. It would be  useful to develop a reliable treatment option for CRS due to haemodynamic  mechanism other than volume control using diuretics. Fibroblast growth factor 23  (FGF23) is a phosphaturic hormone that has recently been identified as a  CKD-related factor affecting CRS. FGF23 treatment has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of CRS progression. SUMMARY: Multiple disorders underlie the development of CRS. Current treatment  options include renin-angiotensin system blockade and volume control, but remain limited. A multidisciplinary approach is required to prevent CRS, including  renal sympathetic denervation, treatment of renal venous hypertension and FGF23  treatment.

INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms  scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  ,  Context: The orally active nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor  antagonist relugolix (Relumina) is being developed by Takeda and ASKA  Pharmaceutical as a treatment for various sex hormone related disorders.  Relugolix was recently approved for marketing in Japan as a treatment for  symptoms associated with uterine fibroids, and studies evaluating the efficacy  of the drug as treatment for endometriosis-associated pain and prostate cancer are currently underway. This article summarizes the milestones in the  development of relugolix leading to this first approval for the treatment of  symptoms associated with uterine fibroids.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign tumors common in premenopausal  women, with strong impact on the health-care systems. For many years, surgery  represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are  observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical  treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and  in ameliorating patient conditions.

It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment.

What is BBCAnalyzer?,BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) is a tool that provides a novel visual approach to facilitate manual inspection of common mutation sites in next-generation sequencing data. It visualizes base counts at predefined positions or regions in sequence alignment data available as," Context: BACKGROUND: Deriving valid variant calling results from raw next-generation  sequencing data is a particularly challenging task, especially with respect to  clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine. However, when using classic  variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of  variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters. Any expected  mutations (e.g. hotspot mutations), that have not been called by the software,  need to be investigated manually. RESULTS: BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) provides a novel visual approach  to facilitate this step of time-consuming, manual inspection of common mutation sites. BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or  regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files. Thereby,  the tool provides a straightforward solution for evaluating any list of expected mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest. In addition  to an ordinary textual report, BBCAnalyzer reports highly customizable plots.  Information on the counted number of bases, the reference bases, known mutations  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context: visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results. In  a typical GES search (GESS), a query GES is searched against a database of GESs  obtained from large numbers of measurements, such as different genetic  backgrounds, disease states and drug perturbations. Database matches sharing  correlated signatures with the query indicate related cellular responses  frequently governed by connected mechanisms, such as drugs mimicking the  expression responses of a disease. To identify which processes are predominantly  modulated in the GESS results, we developed specialized FEA methods combined  with drug-target network visualization tools. The provided analysis tools are useful for studying the effects of genetic, chemical and environmental  perturbations on biological systems, as well as searching single cell GES  databases to identify novel network connections or cell types. The signatureSearch software is unique in that it provides access to an integrated  environment for GESS/FEA routines that includes several novel search and  enrichment methods, efficient data structures, and access to pre-built GES  ,  Context: reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its  measurable perceptual consequences. However, while several research groups now  study synesthesia, there is no single protocol for comparing, contrasting and  pooling synesthetic subjects across these groups. There is no standard battery  of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions.  Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy  this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of  tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a  questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers.  Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We  introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests. By presenting standardized procedures for testing and comparing subjects,  this endeavor hopes to speed scientific progress in synesthesia research.  ,  Context:  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care  analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate sequence alignment tools such as BLASTP, resulting in a 11-15 times faster performance compared to software BLASTP on a modern CPU. Additionally, an FPGA-accelerated version of Cl"," Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context: Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive  approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms.  Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons  of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic  trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band  optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs  intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs).  ,  Context:  Aligning hundreds of sequences using progressive alignment tools such as  ClustalW requires several hours on state-of-the-art workstations. We present a  new approach to compute multiple sequence alignments in far shorter time using reconfigurable hardware. This results in an implementation of ClustalW with  significant runtime savings on a standard off-the-shelf FPGA.  ,  Context:  Advances in computational biology have occurred primarily in the areas of  software and algorithm development; new designs of hardware to support  biological computing are extremely scarce. This is due, we believe, to the presence of a non-trivial knowledge gap between molecular biologists and  computer designers. The existence of this gap is unfortunate, as it has long  been known that for certain problems, special-purpose computers can achieve significant cost/performance gains over general-purpose machines.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is as it has not been mentioned in the provided context information.," Context:  Aortitis can be the manifestation of an underlying infectious or noninfectious  disease process. An autoimmune cause is suggested in a large proportion of  noninfectious causes. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, the pathophysiology of aortitis has been investigated in detail, but the etiology remains unknown.  Most cases of aortitis often go undetected for a long time and are often  identified at late stages of the disease. Recent advances in imaging techniques have significantly improved the diagnosis of aortitis. However, significant  challenges associated with the imaging techniques limit their use. Several  routine inflammation-based markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate  ,  Context: The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled  pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at  nanometer length scales. However, the issue of missing low frequency data  significantly limits the potential of X-ray lasers to reveal sub-nanometer  details of micrometer-sized samples. We have developed a new technique of  dark-field coherent diffractive imaging to simultaneously overcome the missing data issue and enable us to harness the unique contrast mechanisms available in  dark-field microscopy. Images of airborne particulate matter (soot) up to two  microns in length were obtained using single-shot diffraction patterns obtained at the Linac Coherent Light Source, four times the size of objects previously  imaged in similar experiments. This technique opens the door to femtosecond  diffractive imaging of a wide range of micrometer-sized materials that exhibit  ,  Context: Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition that  describes the association of Hirschsprung disease with microcephaly,  developmental delay and characteristic facies. We describe two brothers from a  non-consanguineous family who have classical features of Goldberg-Shprintzen  syndrome. The novel findings in this instance are of foot anomalies including  camptodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd to 4th toes, which have not been  previously described in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.  ,  Context: mono/oligonucleotides among the regions were compared using the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Interestingly, the frequency distributions between the  complementary mono/oligonucleotides revealed statistical similarity, which we  named as intra-strand frequency distribution parity (ISFDP). ISFDP was observed  as a general feature in chromosomes of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.  Violation of ISFDP was also observed in several chromosomes. Chromosomes of  different strains belonging a species in bacteria/archaea (Haemophilus  influenza, Xylella fastidiosa etc.) and chromosomes of a eukaryote are found to  be different among each other with respect to ISFDP violation. ISFDP correlates weakly with ISP in chromosomes suggesting that the latter one is not entirely  responsible for the former. Asymmetry of replication topography and composition  of forward-encoded sequences between the strands in chromosomes are found to be insufficient to explain the ISFDP feature in all chromosomes. This suggests that  multiple factors in chromosomes are responsible for establishing ISFDP.  ,  Context: Small organic molecules are challenging targets for an aptamer selection using  the SELEX technology (SELEX-Systematic Evolution of Ligans by EXponential  enrichment). Often they are not suitable for immobilization on solid surfaces,  which is a common procedure in known aptamer selection methods. The  Capture-SELEX procedure allows the selection of DNA aptamers for solute targets.  A special SELEX library was constructed with the aim to immobilize this library  on magnetic beads or other surfaces. For this purpose a docking sequence was  incorporated into the random region of the library enabling hybridization to a  complementary oligo fixed on magnetic beads. Oligonucleotides of the library which exhibit high affinity to the target and a secondary structure fitting to  the target are released from the beads for binding to the target during the  aptamer selection process. The oligonucleotides of these binding complexes were amplified, purified, and immobilized via the docking sequence to the magnetic  beads as the starting point of the following selection round. Based on this  Capture-SELEX procedure, the successful DNA aptamer selection for the  ,  Context:  Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor progression,  metastasis, and recurrence.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2C9 is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market.," Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which  is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles  in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing. As RA patients might be treated  with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of  filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. METHODS: The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential  interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, were identified using  recombinant enzymes, human microsomes, and cell systems. Furthermore,  filgotinib's interaction potential with CYP3A4 was examined in an open-label  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: In conditions of acute and chronic inflammation hepatic detoxification capacity  is severely impaired due to coordinated downregulation of drug metabolizing  enzymes and transporters. Using global transcriptome analysis of liver tissue  from donors with pathologically elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), we observed  comparable extent of positive and negative acute phase response, where the top  upregulated gene sets included immune response and defense pathways while  downregulation occurred mostly in metabolic and catabolic pathways including  many important drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. We hypothesized that  microRNAs (miRNA), which usually act as negative regulators of gene expression, contribute to this process. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses  identified differentially expressed miRNAs in liver tissues from donors with  elevated CRP, cholestasis, steatosis, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR associates with its own mRNA, enhancing its translation and cytoplasmic levels. It also interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of its own mRNA, increasing the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric"," Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic  overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is an intracellular enzyme that is vital in innate  immunity, but also is a tumor suppressor candidate. Here, we show that  overexpression of RNase L decreases cellular growth and downmodulates the  RNA-binding protein, HuR, a regulator of cell-cycle progression and  tumorigenesis. The effect is temporal, occurring in specific cell-cycle phases  and correlated with the cytoplasmic localization of RNase L. Both cellular growth and HuR were increased in RNASEL-null mouse fibroblast lines when  compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, the stability of HuR mRNA was enhanced in  RNASEL-null cells. The HuR 3' untranslated region (UTR), which harbors U-rich and adenylate-uridylate-rich elements, was potently responsive to RNase L when  compared to control 3' UTR. Our results may offer a new explanation to the tumor  suppressor function of RNase L.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of budding yeast, contributing to nucleosome positioning."," Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: regularly positioned nucleosomes and may involve chromatin remodeling as a key  step of kinetochore assembly. We used tiling microarrays to show that  nucleosomes are, in fact, positioned in regular intervals in the core of  centromere 2, providing the first high-resolution map of regional centromere  chromatin. Nucleosome locations are not disrupted by mutations in kinetochore  protein genes cnp1, mis18, mis12, nuf2, mal2; overexpression of cnp1; or the  deletion of ams2, which encodes a GATA-like factor participating in CENPA  incorporation. Bioinformatics analysis of the centromere sequence indicates  certain enriched motifs in linker regions between nucleosomes and reveals a sequence bias in nucleosome positioning. In addition, sequence analysis of  nucleosome-free regions identifies novel binding sites of Ams2p. We conclude  that centromeric nucleosome positions are stable and may be derived from the underlying DNA sequence.  ,  Context: A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: We found that lamina-associated regions, which are typically localized at the  nuclear periphery, displayed higher somatic mutation frequencies than did the  interlamina regions at the nuclear core. This effect was observed even after  adjustment for features such as GC percentage, chromatin, and replication  timing. Furthermore, mutational signatures differed between the nuclear core and  periphery, thus indicating differences in the patterns of DNA-damage or  DNA-repair processes.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is a muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family and is not mentioned as being present in plants."," Context: and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin  vitro. In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in  diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm  filaments and protofilarnents. The periodic repeat is one of the fundamental  characteristic of all intermediate filaments, and demonstrates the half  staggered arrangement of keratin molecules within the filaments.  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate  filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in  the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific  fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest  impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. To determine whether altered  capillary function or an intrinsic cardiomyocyte defect is responsible for  desmin null DCM, transgenic mice were generated to rescue desmin expression  specifically to cardiomyocytes. Desmin rescue mice display a wild-type cardiac phenotype with no fibrosis or calcification in the myocardium and normalization  of coronary flow. Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is also restored to normal.  Markers of hypertrophy upregulated in desmin null hearts return to wild-type levels in desmin rescue mice. Working hearts were perfused to assess coronary  flow and cardiac power. Restoration of a wild-type cardiac phenotype in a desmin  null background by expression of desmin specifically within cardiomyocyte  ,  Context:  Several aspects of the intermediate filaments' molecular architecture remain  mysterious despite decades of study. The growth process and the final  architecture may depend on the physical, chemical, and biochemical environment. Aiming at clarifying this issue, we have revisited the structure of the human  hair follicle by means of X-ray microdiffraction. We conclude that the  histology-based growth zones along the follicle are correlated to the fine architecture of the filaments deduced from X-ray microdiffraction. Our analysis  reveals the existence of two major polymorph intermediate filament  architectures. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a  ,  Context: proteins exported via a specific protein export apparatus in a well-regulated  manner. Although previous studies have revealed the outline of the flagellar  construction process, the mechanism of axial structure formation, including  axial protein export, is still obscure due to difficulties in direct observation  of protein export and assembly in vivo. We recently developed an in vitro  flagellar protein transport assay system using inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs)  and succeeded in reproducing the early stage of flagellar assembly. However, the  late stage of the flagellar formation process remained to be examined in the  IMVs. In this study, we showed that the filament-type proteins are transported into the IMVs to produce the filament on the hook inside the IMVs. Furthermore,  we provide direct evidence that coordinated flagellar protein export and  assembly can occur at the post-translational level. These results indicate that the ordered construction of the entire flagellar structure can be regulated by  only the interactions between the protein export apparatus, the export substrate  proteins, and their cognate chaperones.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: Protection against infection and maintenance of homeostasis are the hallmarks of  the innate immune system. The complex signaling cascades that occur following  microbial infection have been studied intensely for a number of years and long  noncoding RNA (lncRNA) represent novel regulatory components of these pathways.  The catalogue of lncRNA present in our genomes continues to increase as deep  sequencing data becomes available. It is clear that they represent critical  regulatory steps in a large number of biological systems yet we currently  understand the functions for approximately 1% of all annotated lncRNA. This  review will cover the recent findings on the emerging roles for lncRNA in controlling the inflammatory response and their mechanisms of action. Gaining a  better understanding of these processes could facilitate the development of  novel therapeutics to prevent damaging inflammation.  ,  Context: but knowledge of the mechanisms by which they act is still surprisingly limited,  and claims that almost the entirety of the mammalian genome is transcribed into  functional noncoding transcripts remain controversial. At the same time, a small  number of well-studied lncRNAs have given us important clues about the biology  of these molecules, and a few key functional and mechanistic themes have begun  to emerge, although the robustness of these models and classification schemes  remains to be seen. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA  field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological  functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs. We also reflect on how the recent interest in lncRNAs is deeply rooted in biology's longstanding concern  with the evolution and function of genomes.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks. Seven mRNAs (ANKRD34A, FMODA, GJA3, CNTN5, BMP10, BAI2  and HS3ST6) were involved in both networks of LNC_00035 and LNC_000466. Differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling pathways, such as  ""phosphorylation"", ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"", ""endocytosis"" and  ""MHC protein complex"".

The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An  implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful  for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package available on Bioconductor for detecting hierarchical, biologically relevant Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)."," Context: for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor,  http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .  ,  Context: The spatial organization of genomes is based on their hierarchical  compartmentalization in topological domains. There is growing evidence that  bacterial genomes are organized into insulated domains similar to the  Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) detected in eukaryotic cells.  Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are used to analyze in vivo  DNA proximity based on ligation of distal DNA segments crossed-linked by  bridging proteins. By combining 3C and high-throughput sequencing, the Hi-C  method reveals genome-wide interactions within topological domains and global  genome structure as a whole. This chapter provides detailed guidelines for the preparation of Hi-C sequencing libraries for bacteria.  ,  Context: that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in  yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates  an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family  members.

ClinicalTrials.gov was used as a source  for unpublished data. Additional data sources were obtained through  bibliographic review of selected articles.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that addressed the safety and  efficacy of Vaxchora, the reformulated, single-dose oral CVD 103-HgR cholera  vaccine, were selected for analysis.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Approval of Vaxchora, was based on efficacy of the vaccine in  human trials demonstrating 90.3% protection among those challenged with V  cholerae 10 days after vaccination and in immunogenicity studies with 90% systemic vibriocidal antibody conversion at 6 months after a single-dose of  vaccine.

Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to  these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Conventional smallpox vaccines based on replicating vaccinia virus  (VV) strains (e.g. Lister Elstree, NYCBOH) are associated with a high incidence  of myo-/pericarditis, a severe inflammatory cardiac complication. A new smallpox  vaccine candidate based on a non-replicating Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)  poxvirus has been assessed for cardiac safety in a large placebo-controlled  clinical trial. METHODS: Cardiac safety of one and two doses of MVA compared to placebo was  assessed in 745 healthy subjects. Vaccinia-naïve subjects received either one  dose of MVA and one dose of placebo, two doses of MVA, or two doses of placebo  by subcutaneous injection four weeks apart; vaccinia-experienced subjects received a single dose of MVA. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) and  cardiac safety parameters (recorded as Adverse Events of Special Interest, AESI)  were monitored after each injection. RESULTS: A total of 5 possibly related AESI (3 cases of palpitations, 2 of  tachycardia) were reported during the study. No case of myo- or pericarditis  occurred. One possibly related serious AE (SAE) was reported during the 6-month  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: To guide the use of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine in  response to a release of smallpox virus, the immunogenicity and safety of  shorter vaccination intervals, and administration by jet injector (JI), were  compared to the standard schedule of administration on Days 1 and 29 by syringe  and needle (S&N). METHODS: Healthy adults 18-40years of age were randomly assigned to receive MVA  vaccine subcutaneously by S&N on Days 1 and 29 (standard), Days 1 and 15, or  Days 1 and 22, or to receive the vaccine subcutaneously by JI on Days 1 and 29.  Blood was collected at four time points after the second vaccination for plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (primary endpoint) and ELISA (secondary  endpoint) antibody assays. For each subject, the peak PRNT (or ELISA) titer was  defined by the highest PRNT (or ELISA) titer among all available measurements post second vaccination.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold  increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class  switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B  lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation  endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This  finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune  disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.  ,  Context: The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly  autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines  and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were  inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on yaa-enhanced TLR7 signaling in vitro, and these data place Sles1 downstream from  the lesion in innate immune responses mediated by TLR7, suggesting that Sles1  modulates the activation of adaptive immunity in response to innate immune  signaling.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent  structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis. Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies  ,  Context: growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic  binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for  NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These  results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly  under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not the case, conformational changes of the ectodomain of Robo2 may unmask the  binding site for NELL1/2.  ,  Context: The different time courses of thunderclap headaches, vasoconstriction and  strokes suggest that the responsible vasospastic disorder starts distally and  progresses towards medium sized and large arteries. No relapse was observed  during the 16 +/- 12.4 months of follow-up. Our data suggest that RCVS is more  frequent than previously thought, is more often secondary particularly to  vasoactive substances, and should be considered in patients with recurrent  thunderclap headaches, cSAH or cryptogenic strokes with severe headaches.  ,  Context:  Malaria is one of the major parasitic disease whose rapid spreading and  mortality rate affects all parts of the world especially several parts of Asia  as well as Africa. The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains hamper the progress of current antimalarial therapy and displayed an urgent need for new  antimalarials by targeting novel drug targets. Until now, several promising  targets were explored in order to develop a promising Achilles hill to counter malaria. Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin  breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new  chemical entities to counter malaria. Due to early crystallographic evidence,  ,  Context: 1.95, 1.66, and 1.81 Å resolutions, respectively. The protein structures adopt  an eight-stranded, calycin-like, β-barrel fold and bind an endogenous unknown  ligand at one end of the β-barrel. The amino acids interacting with the ligand  are not conserved in any other protein of known structure with this particular  fold. The size and chemical environment of the bound ligand suggest binding or  transport of a small polar molecule(s) as a potential function for these  proteins. These are the first structural representatives of a newly defined  PF14869 (DUF4488) Pfam family.  ,  Context:  An important issue in developing protein-ligand docking methods is how to  incorporate receptor flexibility. Consideration of receptor flexibility using an  ensemble of precompiled receptor conformations or by employing an effectively enlarged binding pocket has been reported to be useful. However, direct  consideration of receptor flexibility during energy optimization of the docked  conformation has been less popular because of the large increase in computational complexity. In this paper, we present a new docking program called  GalaxyDock that accounts for the flexibility of preselected receptor side-chains  by global optimization of an AutoDock-based energy function trained for flexible  ","31939155, 30700556, 18025032, 25827401, 25044324, 23198780",Roundabouts comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein family emanating from the midline.,"29217730, 31939155, 30700556, 30820596",,,,
Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it has been shown to inhibit the growth and migration/invasion of certain gastric cancer cells (SNU216 and NCI-N87) by blocking Src/FAK, HER"," Context: types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been  identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and  targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We  evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib  (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell  lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines,  saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so  accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment. Median time to progression was 5.7 months  for thymoma patients and 3.6 months for thymic carcinoma patients. Saracatinib  was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Src inhibition by saracatinib did not produce any radiographic  responses, though some patients did experience stable disease. Though negative, this study shows the feasibility of completing a trial in this rare disease, and  of accruing reasonably significant numbers of thymic carcinoma patients.

Several pathways are involved in the  repair of DNA lesions caused by oxidative stress, such as the base excision  repair system (BER), which repairs mutation involving 8-oxoguanine and comprises  the MUTYH, OGG1 and MTH1 genes. We analysed 29 patients, assessing germline  polymorphisms or mutations in these genes by complete genomic sequencing of  exons and adjacent intronic regions. Thirty healthy blood donors served as  controls. No pathogenic germline mutations were identified. We found common and rare new variants in the coding and adjacent intronic regions. In summary, our  data do not support a major role for MUTYH, OGG1 and MTH1 variants in the  etiology of sporadic squamous oral/oropharyngeal carcinomas. This does not exclude the involvement of the three BER genes in the tumorigenesis of SCCHN  through other mechanisms such as promotor hypermethylation, genomic  rearrangements or mutations involving regulatory sequences.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acetate blocks the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), significantly reducing androgen production."," Context: demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side  effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to  abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including castration sensitive, biochemically recurrent, or localized disease, and the  rationale for combinatorial treatment strategies of abiraterone with  enzalutamide and other targeted agents are also discussed.  ,  Context: therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis  inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting.

One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend  survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate  cancer. Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is  currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our  previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to  enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance  exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that  enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have  determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown  of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment. Furthermore, targeting AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant  cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment through AR-V7 inhibition.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"Horner's syndrome and Waardenburg's syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum. Additionally, Alport syndrome is also mentioned in relation to heterochromia iridum."," Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well  described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated  with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare. METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in  ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic  testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed. RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement.  ,  Context: with Alport syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case report of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a  background of X-linked Alport syndrome presenting with gradual and progressive  diminution of vision in the left eye with a central blur. He had already  undergone three renal allografts, was deaf and suffered from hypertension by the  time of his first presentation to ophthalmology. On examination, corrected  visual acuity was 6/9.5 in the right eye and 6/30 in the left eye. Optical  coherence tomography imaging showed an unusual 'stair-case' sign of the fovea in  both eyes, together with choroidal thinning. We postulate that an abnormal vitreomacular interface followed by vitreomacular traction and eventually  separation, removing layers of the inner retina with the vitreous, led to this  unusual appearance. Subsequently, this patient also developed schitic changes more peripherally in the retina which progressed over the following 5 years. CONCLUSION: The stair-case foveal sign, choroidal thinning and mid-peripheral  schisis are three signs that clinicians might expect to encounter on optical  ,  Context: 0.0001).

There  was no significant effect by NDFs on visual field testing in eyes with  strabismic amblyopia or fellow non-amblyopic eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Neutral density filters affect eyes with strabismic amblyopia  differently than they do non-amblyopic eyes. A significant improvement in visual  acuity of eyes with strabismic amblyopia was observed when using a 0.4 NDF  compared to non-amblyopic eyes. Visual acuity was reduced in amblyopic as well  as non-amblyopic eyes when viewing through a 3.0 NDF.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have been found to reduce norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue, leading to a marked reduction in glycerol release. This suggests that thyronamines can affect fat tissue by modulating lipol"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice.

METHODS: A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and  then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50 mg/kg) every second day for 3  weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and  assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. RESULTS: PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose  tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis,  did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine  expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue  induced by a high-fat diet may not be the trigger for impairments in whole body  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: Mutations that inactivate either TSC1 or TSC2 cause tuberous sclerosis. We have  used immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis to see whether there is  phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, and the ribosomal S6 protein in  angiomyolipomas occurring in tuberous scierosis. Hamartin (encoded by TSC1) and  S6K was expressed in all samples. Tuberin (TSC2) was weak or absent in  angiomyolipomas, but present in healthy kidney, whereas, phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase and p56 were present only in angiomyolipomas. Our results indicate  activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin metabolic pathway in tuberous  sclerosis lesions, which contributes to their growth. We suggest that treatment with rapamycin and its analogues could benefit such patients.  ,  Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1  ,  Context: effector in growth control, the small GTPase Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in  brain). Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster Rheb gene were isolated as  growth-inhibitors, whereas overexpression of Rheb promoted cell growth. Our  genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that Rheb functions downstream of the  tumour suppressors Tsc1 (tuberous sclerosis 1)-Tsc2 in the TOR (target of  rapamycin) signalling pathway to control growth, and that a major effector of  Rheb function is ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K).  ,  Context: Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including  transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation  regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein  interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the  bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling  domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features  characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to  phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate  specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation with the process of phosphorylation.  ,  Context: The rate of proteolysis is an important determinant of the intracellular protein  content. Part of the degradation of intracellular proteins occurs in the  lysosomes and is mediated by macroautophagy. In liver, macroautophagy is very  active and almost completely accounts for starvation-induced proteolysis.  Factors inhibiting this process include amino acids, cell swelling and insulin.  In the mechanisms controlling macroautophagy, protein phosphorylation plays an  important role. Activation of a signal transduction pathway, ultimately leading  to phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, accompanies inhibition of  macroautophagy. Components of this pathway may include a heterotrimeric Gi3-protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase. Recent evidence  indicates that lysosomal protein degradation can be selective and occurs via  ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways.

Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both  complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members:  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation  of Akt, PKCα (protein kinase Cα) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced  protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated  single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how  activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of  Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2  components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKCα  at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1  knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the  kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in  enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"In the UK, there is no national screening programme for prostate cancer. The National Screening Committee has assessed prostate cancer screening and concluded that it should not be carried out. However, some urologists use higher PSA cut-offs than recommended by the Department"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening. CONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the  United Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Screening for prostate cancer with serum prostate specific antigen  (PSA) remains a controversial topic. The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive  guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing  this test. This study aims to assess men's knowledge of the PSA test at the time  of their referral and their attitude towards screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 men referred to urology via the 'fast  track' prostate cancer service were recruited into the study. Of these, 191 were  referred from primary care and 28 from secondary care. All men completed a  questionnaire regarding their knowledge and expectation of the test. RESULTS: The response rate for completed questionnaires was 100%. Overall, 91  (41.5%) men were aware that their PSA had been performed prior to referral and  only 79 (36%) men understood why the test was being done. Patients referred from secondary care appeared to be better informed. Despite these figures, 175 (80%)  men said they would recommend PSA testing to a friend or colleague, and 196  (89%) men said the test should be broadly publicised.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a  screen for prostate cancer is contentious. Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study  investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values.  RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents) are--3.5 ng/ml for 50 - 59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60 - 69 year olds and 6.5  ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58%, 200/346) of respondents were aware  of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20% (n = 69/346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68%, n = 234/346) used higher PSA cut-offs than  recommended by the DoH. The level of compliance showed marked regional variation  with a range from 7% to 44% (median 19%). In addition, it was apparent that  ,  Context: canSAR (http://cansar.icr.ac.uk) is a public integrative cancer-focused  knowledgebase for the support of cancer translational research and drug  discovery.

What is known about a drug, its cellular  sensitivity profile and what proteins is it known to bind that may explain unusual bioactivity?

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. Low selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European women, and some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients with autoimmune thyroid"," Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of  thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent  glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.  AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a blinded placebo-controlled prospective study done in 60 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (as defined by an  anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) level more than 150 IU/ml) irrespective  of the baseline thyroid status. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism who are on antithyroid drugs, patients on any other medication, which may alter the  immunity status of the patients, and pregnant patients were excluded from the  study. Patients were randomized into two age and TPOAb-matched groups; 30  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease.

METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo.

For the  comparison of long-term ospemifene with placebo, endometrial thickness (SMD =  0.90, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.23, P = 0.00001), treatment emergent adverse event,  discontinuations due to adverse event, and serious adverse event indicated that  ospemifene was generally safe. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal  atrophy.  ,  Context: recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of  postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed  successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription  therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness,  depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and  moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective  estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term  studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal  women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the  effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient  preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to  ,  Context: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.  ,  Context: vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.  ,  Context: Ospemifene (Osphena™) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),  with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the  upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and  hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation  significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased  egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of  sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3- and 9.6-fold  increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these  findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C.  elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: The lysosomal-autophagic pathway is activated by starvation and plays an  important role in both cellular clearance and lipid catabolism. However, the  transcriptional regulation of this pathway in response to metabolic cues is  uncharacterized. Here we show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master  regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is induced by starvation  through an autoregulatory feedback loop and exerts a global transcriptional  control on lipid catabolism via Ppargc1α and Ppar1α. Thus, during starvation a  transcriptional mechanism links the autophagic pathway to cellular energy  metabolism. The conservation of this mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a fundamental role for TFEB in the evolution of the adaptive response  to food deprivation. Viral delivery of TFEB to the liver prevented weight gain  and metabolic syndrome in both diet-induced and genetic mouse models of obesity, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for disorders of lipid metabolism.  ,  Context: RNA editing increases transcriptome diversity through post-transcriptional  modifications of RNA. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the  adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in  higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but  their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans  at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a new computational pipeline with a ""bisulfite-seq-mapping-like"" step and achieved  a threefold increase in identification sensitivity.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into  focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular  tachyarrhythmias. Calcium overload and spontaneous calcium release from the  sarcoplasmatic reticulum are regarded as possible initiations of early and  delayed afterdepolarization thereby triggering ventricular arrhythmias. In  chronic heart failure, calcium overload is more likely to occur compared with  healthy hearts, which is one explantation for the increased vulnerability in  this condition. L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX), and  ryanodine receptor are crucial for calcium homeostasis and therefore represent potential targets for antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Experimental studies have  proven beneficial effects for all these three mechanisms in prevention and  suppression of tachyarrhythmias. However, clinical data is mainly available for the L-type calcium channel inhibitor verapamil. Therefore, it is still a long  way to clinical employment of drugs modifying cellular calcium handling for  antiarrhythmic therapy.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: Ion channels underlie the electrical activity of cells. Calcium channels have a  unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity,  they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses  within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the  heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx  through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction.  Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile  dysfunction and cardiac remodelling. Reactive oxygen species participate in the  development of pathology by altering the redox state of regulatory proteins. There is now good evidence that reactive oxygen species regulate the function of  calcium channels. In this mini-review, the evidence for regulation of calcium  channels by reactive oxygen species and implications with respect to pathology are presented. Calcium channels may represent a target for intervention during  hypoxic trigger of arrhythmia or chronic pathological remodelling.  ,  Context: parameters. Untreated diabetic animals had slower heart rates, depressed rate of  contraction and rate of relaxation, lower peak left ventricular systolic  pressure, and elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure. All of these changes  were significantly improved in diabetic rats receiving verapamil treatment. The  beneficial effects of verapamil were more evident with higher doses (8  mg.kg-1.day-1) than with the lower doses (2 mg.kg-1.day-1). The diabetic animals  also showed alterations in myocardial high-energy phosphate stores and exhibited  evidence of ultrastructural damage; these abnormalities were improved by  verapamil treatment without affecting their hyperglycemic status. Our results demonstrate that verapamil is capable of preventing diabetes-induced myocardial  changes and support the involvement of Ca2+ in the cardiac pathology during  diabetes.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.," Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: attention for their potential roles in insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.  FTY720/fingolimod, a prodrug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is  phosphorylated in vivo to its active phosphorylated form by sphingosine kinase 2  and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide  biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks  of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the  ,  Context: 100 mg golimumab) and 4 developed active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab (50 mg or 100 mg) maintained clinical response through  week 54 in patients who responded to induction therapy with golimumab and had  moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis; patients who received 100 mg  golimumab had clinical remission and mucosal healing at weeks 30 and 54. Safety  was consistent with that reported for other TNFα antagonists and golimumab in  other approved indications. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00488631.  ,  Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents. Both  preclinical and clinical studies of this drug provide the significant protection  of hematopoietic progentitors from a broad range of cytotoxic agents such as  cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vinblastine, carboplatin, mitomycin-C, fotemustine,  doxorubicin, daunorubicin and radiation as well. Moreover, this drug can protect  other normal organs or tissues including kidney, salivary gland, liver, heart,  lung and small intestine. Amifostine is quite safe, the two major side effects  are vomiting and hypotension, and the minor effects are flushing, sneezing,  dizziness, chills, metallic taste etc. The drug was approved by the FDA of U.S.A. for use as a cytoprotectant in cyclophosphamide and cisplatin treatment  for advanced ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer.  ,  Context: trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor  monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is  discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments.  Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: and therapeutic strategies have resulted in increasing numbers of new drug  applications and approvals. Consequently, practicing oncologists need to learn  how the newly available agents function and what toxicities to watch for, as  well as ways to optimize the use of both new drugs and previously approved drugs  with new indications. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration approved  three novel drugs for the treatment of solid malignancies-olaratumab in selected  patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, atezolizumab for the treatment of bladder  cancer, and rucaparib for the treatment of ovarian cancer; also in 2016, the use  of previously approved anticancer agents (including atezolizumab) was expanded into 11 new patient populations. The diversity of options for patients is  evident in the broad range of the 2016 approvals, which include immune  checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and traditional cytotoxic agents. This article focuses on the new agents and  indications that emerged in 2016 for solid tumor treatment.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization by occupying chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and associating with proteins that interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth1, Ssu72, and histone H4."," Context: immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between  Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin.  These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly,  mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been  shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we  have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies  chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin  associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries,  such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super  ,  Context: polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to  transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach  ,  Context:  Cohesins, which mediate sister chromatin cohesion, and CTCF, which functions at  chromatin boundaries, play key roles in the structural and functional  organization of chromosomes. We examined the binding of these two factors on the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episome during latent infection  and found a striking colocalization within the control region of the major  latency transcript responsible for expressing LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), vFLIP (ORF71), and vmiRNAs. Deletion of the CTCF-binding site from the viral  genome disrupted cohesin binding, and crippled colony formation in 293 cells.  Clonal instability correlated with elevated expression of lytic cycle gene  ,  Context: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are increasingly being implicated in diverse functional  roles. Majority of these ncRNAs have their origin in the repetitive elements of  genome. Significantly, increase in genomic complexity has been correlated with  increase in repetitive content of the genome. Primate-specific Alu repeats,  belonging to SINE class of repeats, is the most abundant repeat class inhabiting  the human genome. Of the many possible functional roles of Alu repeats, they  have been shown to modulate human transcriptome by virtue of harboring diverse  array of functional RNA pol II TFBS, cryptic splice-site-mediated Alu  exonization and as probable miRNA targets. Retro-transposition of Alu harboring TFBS has shaped up gene-specific regulatory networks. Alu exonized transcripts  are raw material for dsRNA-mediated A-I editing leading to nuclear retention of  transcripts and change in miRNA target. miRNA targets within Alu may titrate the effective miRNA or transcript concentration, thus acting as 'miRNA sponge'.  Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await  clear functional understanding. These have contributed toward evolution of  ,  Context: had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a  common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization  revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing  long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.  These data demonstrate a crucial role for Nipbl in limb development, and support  the view that its actions on multiple gene pathways result from its influence,  together with Mediator, on regulation of long-range chromosomal interactions.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Colistin is mentioned as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii infection, suggesting it has antimicrobial properties. Additionally, it is discussed in combination with other antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, to have synergistic activity against certain"," Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Use of natural agents is an upcoming area of research in cancer  biology. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) has received great attention  because of its therapeutic potential in various conditions including cancer. It  is an active/abundant component of propolis, a honey bee hive product produced  by bees using their enzyme-rich digestive secretions on resinous mix, bee wax  and pollen from plants. It is used to protect the beehive against bacteria and  other infections. Therefore a literature survey was done to understand the  therapeutic potential of this compound. Although a lot of work has been done on  chemotherapeutic aspects of CAPE and many reviews were available, yet its role as a radiomodulator was not clear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the review was to collect data on role of Caffeic  acid phenethyl ester as radioprotector and /or sensitizer to evaluate its  potential as modulator of radiation effects during cancer therapy. METHODS: For literature survey, Pubmed and Google search engines were used. Data  were collected up to August 2017. PubMed advanced search builder showed 845  papers on CAPE. This search was further narrowed down to synthesis,  ,  Context: three proteins, of which MbF1-2 provided over 50% of the antimicrobial activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study showed significant antimicrobial  activity from several proteins present in the honey of M. beecheii.  Interestingly, the non-glycosylated protein fraction demonstrated antihaemolytic  activity and adversely affected the expression of virulence genes in Escherichia  coli O157:H7; these proteins have the potential to be used in developing  therapeutic agents against this bacterium.  ,  Context: rituximab and ofatumumab obinutuzumab, although in combination with  chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment  of elderly patients with CLL. Lenalidomide as monotherapy has demonstrated  clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed disease and first data within  clinical trials have been generated in the front-line setting. A promising class  of novel agents has been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell  receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while  idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the  phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL are the BH3-mimetic  inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins. Other interesting  candidate drugs that are currently explored for CLL patients include small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) proteins (e. g. TRU-016), CDK inhibitors (e.  g. dinaciclib), HDAC inhibitors and others.
