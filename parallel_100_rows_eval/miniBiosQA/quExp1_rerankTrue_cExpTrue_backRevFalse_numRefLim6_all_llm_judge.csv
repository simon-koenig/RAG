What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K27, plays a significant role in medulloblastoma. High levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) are found in Group 3 and"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma.

Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.  ,  Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the  ","23179372, 23179372, 14688019, 14688019, 23184418, 19270706","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",1.0,[1. 1. 0. 0. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.],0.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,The text does not mention the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. It only discusses their involvement in cancer cell proliferation and their potential as therapeutic targets.," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in various genomes, as demonstrated by its application in the fly genome."," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Alternative promoter usage generated at least five alternatively spliced BORIS  mRNAs with different half-lives determined by varying 5'-UTRs. In normal testis,  BORIS is transcribed from all three promoters, but 84% of the 30 cancer cell  lines tested used only promoter(s) A and/or C while the others utilized  primarily promoters B and C. The differences in promoter usage between normal  and cancer cells suggested that they were subject to differential regulation. We  found that DNA methylation and functional p53 contributes to the negative  regulation of each promoter. Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally  BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related  associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and  between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORIS.  ,  Context: maintained during the midblastula transition (MBT). We find that regions of  accessibility are established sequentially, where enhancers are opened in  advance of promoters and insulators. These open states are stably maintained in  highly condensed mitotic chromatin to ensure faithful inheritance of prior  accessibility status across cell divisions. The temporal progression of  establishment is controlled by the biological timers that control the onset of  the MBT. In general, acquisition of promoter accessibility is controlled by the  biological timer that measures the nucleo-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, whereas  timing of enhancer accessibility is regulated independently of the N:C ratio. These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two  transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in  controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA.  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: DNase I footprint analysis of this gel shift complex showed an extended  footprint over both the Sp1 and the Ets1 binding site, demonstrating that Sp1  and Ets1 form a ternary complex with the PTHrP DNA. Cotransfection of an Ets1  and Sp1 expression vector into Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that Sp1  can functionally cooperate with Ets1 to transactivate the PTHrP promoter. We  conclude from these data that Ets1 and Sp1 can cooperatively regulate PTHrP P2  promoter activity.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease, which associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context:  Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS.  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ,  Context:  Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia  after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distribution of  Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism,  and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of  cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests that its aggregation constitutes  one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation  strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril formation.

We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: 34.8% and 44.4%).

With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.

In these situations, adaptation should commonly  produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data.

However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep.

List markers for autophagy.,Lactate dehydrogenase is a cargo marker for autophagic cargo sequestration assay. LC3 is a phagophore-associated protein that can be used as a marker for autophagy.," Context: various stress conditions. The term autophagy denotes any cellular process which  involves the delivery of cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for degradation.  Autophagy, in filamentous fungi plays a critical role during cellular  development and pathogenicity. Autophagy, like the mitogen-activated protein  (MAP) kinase cascade and nutrient-sensing cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway, is also an  important process for appressorium turgor accumulation in order to penetrate the  leaf surface of host plant and destroy the plant defense. Yeast, an autophagy  model, has been used to compare the multi-valued functions of ATG  (autophagy-related genes) in different filamentous fungi. The autophagy machinery in both yeast and filamentous fungi is controlled by Tor kinase and  both contain two distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes. In this  review, we focus on the functions of ATG genes during pathogenic development in  filamentous fungi.  ,  Context: the IRGM gene in human populations have also been linked to predisposition to  tuberculosis. There are several areas of most recent growth: first, links  between autophagy regulators and infectious disease predisposition in human  populations; second, demonstration of a role for autophagy in infection control  in vivo in animal models; third, the definition of specific antiautophagic  defenses in highly evolved pathogens; and fourth, recognition of connections  between the ubiquitin system and autophagy of bacteria (and interestingly  mitochondria, which are incidentally organelles of bacterial evolutionary  origin) via a growing list of modifier and adapter proteins including p62/SQSTM1, NDP52, Atg32, Parkin, and Nix/BNIP3L.  ,  Context:  Autophagy is the process by which portions of cytoplasm are enclosed by  membranous organelles, phagophores, which deliver the sequestered cytoplasm to  degradative autophagic vacuoles. Genes and proteins involved in phagophore manufacture have been extensively studied, but little is known about how mature  phagophores proceed through the subsequent steps of expansion, closure and  fusion. Here we have addressed these issues by combining our unique autophagic cargo sequestration assay (using the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase as a  cargo marker) with quantitative measurements of the lipidation-dependent  anchorage and turnover of the phagophore-associated protein LC3. In isolated rat  ,  Context: Macroautophagy is a cellular catabolic process that involves the sequestration  of cytoplasmic constituents into double-membrane vesicles known as  autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes, where they deliver their  cargo for degradation. The main physiological role of autophagy is to recycle  intracellular components, under conditions of nutrient deprivation, so as to  supply cells with vital materials and energy. Selective autophagy also takes place in nutrient-rich conditions to rid the cell of damaged organelles or  protein aggregates that would otherwise compromise cell viability. Mitophagy is  a selective type of autophagy, whereby damaged or superfluous mitochondria are eliminated to maintain proper mitochondrial numbers and quality control. While  mitophagy shares key regulatory factors with the general macroautophagy pathway,  it also involves distinct steps, specific for mitochondrial elimination. Recent  ,  Context: Autophagy is a vesicular process for the lysosomal degradation of protein  aggregates and of damaged or redundant organelles. Autophagy plays an important  role in cell homeostasis, and there is evidence that this process is  dysregulated in cancer cells. Recent in vitro preclinical studies have indicated  that autophagy is involved in the cytotoxic response to chemotherapeutics in  thyroid cancer cells. Indeed, several oncogenes and oncosuppressor genes  implicated in thyroid carcinogenesis also play a role in the regulation of  autophagy. In addition, some epigenetic modulators involved in thyroid  carcinogenesis also influence autophagy. In this review, we highlight the genetic and epigenetic factors that mechanistically link thyroid carcinogenesis  and autophagy, thus substantiating the rationale for an autophagy-targeted  therapy of aggressive and radio-chemo-resistant thyroid cancers.  ,  Context: autophagy can lead to the execution of apoptotic (type I) or necrotic (type III)  cell death programs, presumably via common regulators such as proteins from the  Bcl-2 family. On the other hand, limited self-eating can provide cells with  metabolic substrates to meet their energetic demands under stressful conditions,  such as nutrient deprivation, or favor the selective elimination of damaged (and  potentially dangerous) organelles. In these instances, autophagy operates as a  pro-survival mechanism. The coordinate regulation of these opposite effects of  autophagy relies upon a complex network of signal transducers, most of which  also participate in non-autophagic signaling cascades. Thus, autophagy occupies a crucial position within the cell's metabolism, and its modulation may  represent an alternative therapeutic strategy in several pathological settings  including cancer and neurodegeneration. Here, we present a general outline of autophagy followed by a detailed analysis of organelle-specific autophagic  pathways and of their intimate connections with cell death.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use. A literature  search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of  bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events  and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context: Recent in vivo and in vitro data of patients analyzed for genetic susceptibility  to radiation during cancer therapy have shown structural changes in the  chromosomes to be prevalent both in the patients being treated and in their  immediate family members. As structural changes in chromosomes frequently lead  to activation of proto-oncogenes and elimination of tumor-suppressor genes, they  represent important mechanisms for the initiation of DNA repair processes and tumorigenesis. With the exception of rare genetic syndromes such as AT (Ataxia  telangiectasia) or NBS (Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome), the background for the  inheritance of genetic susceptibility to radiation is unknown. Recently, a large-scale genetic screen of mouse mutants has been established within the  German Human Genome Project (Hrabè de Angelis and Balling 1998).

The consequences of these processes for stem cells  can be profound: diminution in stem cell pools, or, because of altered gene expression, an increased chance for stem cell differentiation or malignant  transformation.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Immediately Early Genes (IEGs) are not mentioned in the provided context information. Therefore, it is uncertain whether IEGs create a ripple effect of transcription based on the given text."," Context: BACKGROUND: The human genome is highly organized in the three-dimensional  nucleus. Chromosomes fold locally into topologically associating domains (TADs)  defined by increased intra-domain chromatin contacts. TADs contribute to gene  regulation by restricting chromatin interactions of regulatory sequences, such  as enhancers, with their target genes. Disruption of TADs can result in altered  gene expression and is associated to genetic diseases and cancers. However, it is not clear to which extent TAD regions are conserved in evolution and whether  disruption of TADs by evolutionary rearrangements can alter gene expression. RESULTS: Here, we hypothesize that TADs represent essential functional units of genomes, which are stable against rearrangements during evolution. We  investigate this using whole-genome alignments to identify evolutionary  rearrangement breakpoints of different vertebrate species. Rearrangement  ,  Context: Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are conserved during evolution and play  roles in guiding and constraining long-range regulation of gene expression.  Disruption of TAD boundaries results in aberrant gene expression by exposing  genes to inappropriate regulatory elements. Recent studies have shown that TAD  disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through  two mechanisms. One mechanism locally disrupts domains by deleting or mutating a  TAD boundary leading to fusion of the two adjacent TADs. The other mechanism  involves genomic rearrangements that break up TADs and creates new ones without  directly affecting TAD boundaries. Understanding the mechanisms by which TADs form and control long-range chromatin interactions will therefore not only  provide insights into the mechanism of gene regulation in general, but will also  reveal how genomic rearrangements and mutations in cancer genomes can lead to misregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.  ,  Context: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show here that growing plectonemes  resulting from transcription-induced supercoiling have the ability to actively  push cohesin rings along chromatin fibres. The pushing direction is such that  within each topologically associating domain (TAD) cohesin rings forming  handcuffs move from the source of supercoiling, constituted by RNA polymerase  with associated DNA topoisomerase TOP1, towards borders of TADs, where supercoiling is released by topoisomerase TOPIIB. Cohesin handcuffs are pushed  by continuous flux of supercoiling that is generated by transcription and is  then progressively released by action of TOPIIB located at TADs borders. Our model explains what can be the driving force of chromatin loop extrusion and how  it can be ensured that loops grow quickly and in a good direction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a two-part, single-arm dose escalation/expansion phase I study (NAVIGATOR; NCT02508532) in  patients with U/M GISTs treated with oral avapritinib 30-600 mg once daily. The  primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; the impact of dose modification  ,  Context: (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 ), or exon 9 (UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ) mutations, respectively. We  compared avapritinib (10 and 30 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle, imatinib (50  mg/kg/bid) or regorafenib (30 mg/kg/once daily; UZLX-GIST9 KIT11+17 );  avapritinib (10, 30, 100 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle or imatinib  [UZLX-GIST3 KIT11 ]; and avapritinib (10, 30, 60 mg/kg/once daily) versus  vehicle, imatinib (50, 100 mg/kg/twice daily), or sunitinib (40 mg/kg/once  daily; UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ).  RESULTS: In all models, avapritinib resulted in reduction of tumor volume,  significant inhibition of proliferation, and reduced KIT signaling. In two  models, avapritinib led to remarkable histologic responses, increase in apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation. Avapritinib showed superior  (UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 and -GIST2B KIT 9 ) or equal (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 )  antitumor activity to the standard dose of imatinib. In UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 , the antitumor effects of avapritinib were significantly better than with  imatinib or regorafenib.

In humans,  thousands of circRNA transcriptional products precisely express in specific developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Due to their stability and  specificity, circRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  To provide an integrated and standardized circRNA expression profile for human cancers, we performed extensive data curation across 11 technical platforms,  collecting 48 expression profile data sets for 18 cancer types and amassing  860 751 expression records. We also identified 189 193 differential expression  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types. Therefore, the present review  evaluated recent research articles in PubMed that were published between November 2017 and September 2020.

They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates.

At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic.

The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and  headache response at two hours. The first primary hypothesis tested the  dose-response trend for two-hour pain freedom using a logistic regression model.  Subsequent hypotheses tested the effects of each dose on the co-primary  endpoints, using a closed sequential testing procedure to control for  multiplicity. RESULTS: A total of 527 participants received ubrogepant and 113 received  placebo. A positive response trend in the proportion of participants achieving two-hour pain freedom was demonstrated (p < 0.001). Ubrogepant 100 mg was  significantly superior to placebo for two-hour pain freedom (25.5% vs 8.9%) but  not for two-hour headache response.

This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant).

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β.," Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous  mutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or  cryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent  of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta,  initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/  Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in  CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of  these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer  half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not  tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context: mutations and the advent of IL-1 targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at  suppressing inflammation, with limited success. The selective blockade of  IL-1beta, with anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), not only provided supportive  evidence for the role of IL-1beta in CAPS, but also demonstrated the efficacy of  targeting IL-1beta for treatment of these conditions. In February, 2008, 'Orphan  Drug' approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rilonacept (IL-1  Trap/Arcalyst(), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc) was given for the treatment of  two CAPS disorders, FCAS and MWS in adults and children 12 years and older,  making rilonacept the first therapy approved for the treatment of CAPS.  ,  Context: of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function.

Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context:  Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"Yes, TAMs are considered good anticancer therapeutic targets because targeting them has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, and integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs can complement conventional therapies. Additionally, re-educating TAMs towards an antitumor phenotype"," Context: macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer  treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting TAMs with conventional therapy.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is genetically transmitted in 30% to 40% of cases, similar to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Mutations in the same genes, such as betaMHC"," Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984. This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the presentation, diagnosis and management of  isolated left ventricular non-compaction in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with progressive symptoms of heart failure.  CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are important as treatment and prognosis may differ significantly. Our current  understanding of isolated left ventricular non-compaction, including diagnostic  criteria, management and prognosis, is discussed.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM). BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype. In  addition, INLVM with a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle, ventricular  dysfunction, and deep trabeculations, is also inherited, and the genes  ,  Context:  Mutations in the betaMHC (beta-myosin heavy chain), a sarcomeric protein are  responsible for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms  whereby distinct mutations in the betaMHC gene cause two kinds of cardiomyopathy are still unclear. In the present study we report a novel betaMHC mutation found  in a patient with isolated LVNC [LV (left ventricular) non-compaction] and the  phenotype of a mouse mutant model carrying the same mutation. To find the mutation responsible, we searched for genomic mutations in 99 unrelated probands  with dilated cardiomyopathy and five probands with isolated LVNC, and identified  a p.Met531Arg mutation in betaMHC in a 13-year-old girl with isolated LVNC.  ,  Context:  Accumulating data suggest a link between alterations/deficiencies in  cytoskeletal proteins and the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure,  although the molecular basis for this link remains unclear. Cypher/ZASP is a cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its  encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of  the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, opposing DDK function. It also tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at  late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Our results indicate that Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining  the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating  higher-order chromatin architecture.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown.

Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that  Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: Rif1, originally recognized for its role at telomeres in budding yeast, has been  implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes in mammals, including  pluripotency of stem cells, response to double-strand breaks, and breast cancer  development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo  fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. RNA interference to human Rif1 decreases the efficiency of homology-directed repair  (HDR), and Rif1 deficiency results in aberrant aggregates of the HDR factor  Rad51. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric  heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the  repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR.

Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members.

In minigene expression systems, loading of U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","No, there is no mention of human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, or their expression in lung cancers."," Context: molecule inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R and related kinases, decreases  microglial numbers by promoting microglial apoptosis in both CSF1 overexpressing  and control mice. Microglia in CSF1 overexpressing mice exhibit gene expression  profiles indicating that they are not basally M1 or M2 polarized, but they do  have defects in inducing expression of certain genes in response to the  inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that the CSF1  overexpression observed in CNS pathologies likely has pleiotropic influences on  microglia. Furthermore, small molecule inhibition of CSF1R has the potential to  reverse CSF1-driven microglial accumulation that is frequently observed in CNS pathologies, but can also promote apoptosis of normal microglia.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests G-protein-coupled receptor-2-interacting  protein-1 (GIT1) overexpression in several human metastatic tumors, including  breast, lung, and prostate. Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal  angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in  pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In the present study, we show inhibition of angiogenesis  in matrigel implants as well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and melanoma tumor  growth in GIT1-knockout mice. We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired  ,  Context: Diversification of CSN complexes during evolution is most likely another  adaptation to meet different cellular requirements. Best known CSN variants are  formed by different CSN subunit isoforms. For instance, in plant cells, isoforms  have been identified for the MPN-domain subunits CSN5 (CSN5A and CSN5B) and CSN6  (CSN6A and CSN6B) which form four distinct CSN variants. In mammalian cells  CSNCSN7A and CSNCSN7B variants are generated by CSN7 isoforms. We demonstrate  that the two variants coexist in human LiSa-2 cells and in mouse embryonic  fibroblasts. During adipogenic differentiation of LiSa-2 cells CSN7B increases  in parallel with an elevation of the total CSN complex. Permanent overexpression of Flag-CSN7B but not of Flag-CSN7A accelerates adipogenesis in LiSa-2 cells  indicating a specific function of the CSNCSN7B variant in stimulating  adipogenesis. Silencing of CSN7A as well as of CSN7B in LiSa-2 cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) reduces adipogenic differentiation  demonstrating that both CSNCSN7A and CSNCSN7B variants are involved in the  process.  ,  Context: Macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1) is a cytokine that is upregulated in  several diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). To examine the effects of  CSF1 overexpression on microglia, transgenic mice that overexpress CSF1 in the  glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) compartment were generated. CSF1  overexpressing mice have increased microglial proliferation and increased  microglial numbers compared with controls. Treatment with PLX3397, a small  molecule inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R and related kinases, decreases  microglial numbers by promoting microglial apoptosis in both CSF1 overexpressing  and control mice. Microglia in CSF1 overexpressing mice exhibit gene expression profiles indicating that they are not basally M1 or M2 polarized, but they do  have defects in inducing expression of certain genes in response to the  inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that the CSF1 overexpression observed in CNS pathologies likely has pleiotropic influences on  microglia. Furthermore, small molecule inhibition of CSF1R has the potential to  reverse CSF1-driven microglial accumulation that is frequently observed in CNS  ,  Context: proliferation, but the cellular and molecular basis for these functions are not  fully understood. In this study, we show that both the RII receptor Punt (Put)  and the R-Smad Smad2 are strongly required for cell and tissue growth. Knocking  down the expression of Put or Smad2 in salivary glands causes alterations in  nucleolar structure and functions. Cells with decreased TGFβ/Activin signalling  accumulate intermediate pre-rRNA transcripts containing internal transcribed  spacer 1 regions accompanied by the nucleolar retention of ribosomal proteins.  Thus, our results show that TGFβ/Activin signalling is required for ribosomal  biogenesis, a key aspect of cellular growth control. Importantly, overexpression of Put enhanced cell growth induced by Drosophila Myc, a well-characterized  inducer of nucleolar hypertrophy and ribosome biogenesis.  ,  Context: The basic region-leucine zipper transcription factor c-Jun regulates gene  expression and cell function. It participates in the formation of homo- or  heterodimeric complexes that specifically bind to DNA sequences called  activating protein 1 (AP-1) sites. The stability and activity of c-Jun is  regulated by phosphorylation within the N-terminal activation domain. Mitogen-  and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) were previously the only  described enzymes phosphorylating c-Jun at the N terminus in vivo. In this  report we demonstrate a JNK-independent activation of c-Jun in vivo directed by  the constitutive photomorphogenesis (COP9) signalosome. The overexpression of signalosome subunit 2 (Sgn2), a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, leads to de  novo assembly of the complex with a partial incorporation of the overexpressed  subunit. The de novo formation of COP9 signalosome parallels an increase of c-Jun protein resulting in elevated AP-1 transcriptional activity. The c-Jun  activation caused by Sgn2 overexpression is independent of JNK and  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4.

These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Biallelic variants in PCDH19 (not PCDHGC4) cause Dravet syndrome in 16% of SCN1A-negative patients.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of  propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a dodecameric enzyme composed of two different  proteins alpha-PCC and beta-PCC, nuclear encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes,  respectively. Mutations in either gene cause PA and to date, up to 47 different  allelic variations in the PCCB gene have been identified in different  populations. In this work, we describe the expression studies of 18 PCCB sequence changes in order to elucidate their functional consequences. We have  used a PCCB-deficient transformed fibroblast cell line to target the wild-type  and mutant proteins to their physiological situation, analysing the effect of the mutations on PCC activity and protein stability. Of the 18 mutant proteins  tested for activity, those carrying the L17M and A497V substitutions showed an  activity similar to the wild-type one, which proves that these changes do not  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood.

To investigate the role of TARDBP mutations in a  clinical series of Finnish FTLD patients, we sequenced TARDBP exons 1 to 6 in 77  FTLD patients. No evident pathogenic mutations were found. We identified a novel  heterozygous c.876_878delCAG sequence variant in 2 related patients with  behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia without amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis. The variant is predicted to cause an amino acid deletion of serine at  position 292 (p.Ser292del). However, p.Ser292del was also found in 1 healthy  middle-aged control. Interestingly, both patients carried the C9ORF72 expansion. Therefore, the TARDBP variant p.Ser292del might be considered a rare  polymorphism and the C9ORF72 repeat expansion the actual disease-causing  mutation in the family.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered.

Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations.

How to  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination.

However, general-purpose computers including parallel computers or multi-core  computers exhibit parallel efficiency of no more than 50%. Field Programmable  Gate-Array (FPGA) chips provide a new approach to accelerate RNAalifold by  exploiting fine-grained custom design.

The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: Reconfigurable systolic arrays can be adapted to efficiently resolve a wide  spectrum of computational problems; parallelism is naturally explored in  systolic arrays and reconfigurability allows for redefinition of the  interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically).

The web site also contains  supplementary information.  ,  Context: used in micro-bioanalytical investigations. Recent advances in ion probe  technologies have increased the dynamic range and sensitivity of analyte  detection by SIMS, allowing two- and three-dimensional localization of analytes  in a variety of cells. SIMS operating in the mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)  mode can routinely reach spatial resolutions at the submicron level; therefore,  it is frequently used in studies of the chemical composition of subcellular  structures. MALDI MS offers a large mass range and high sensitivity of analyte  detection. It has been successfully applied in a variety of single-cell and  organelle profiling studies. Innovative instrumentation such as scanning microprobe MALDI and mass microscope spectrometers enables new subcellular MSI  measurements. Other approaches for MS-based chemical imaging and profiling  include those based on near-field laser ablation and inductively-coupled plasma MS analysis, which offer complementary capabilities for subcellular chemical  imaging and profiling.  ,  Context: DNA DSB foci yield among imaging and other methods such as gel electrophoresis.  Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential  tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost  two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to  image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of γ-H2AX foci formation  after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state  depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured  illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and  HyVolution 2. We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques with as low as 30-nm resolution, each focus may be further resolved, thus  increasing the number of foci per radiation dose compared to standard  microscopy. Furthermore, the DNA repair proteins 53BP1 (after low-LET irradiations) and Ku70/Ku80 (from laser microbeam irradiation) do not always  yield a significantly increased number of foci when imaged by the  super-resolution techniques, suggesting that γ-H2AX, 53PB1 and Ku70/80 repair  ,  Context: The phase problem is inherent to crystallographic, astronomical and optical  imaging where only the intensity of the scattered signal is detected and the  phase information is lost and must somehow be recovered to reconstruct the  object's structure. Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on  utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the  ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. Here, unlike in the case of crystals where structures can be solved by  model building and phase refinement, the phase distribution of the wave  scattered by an individual molecule must directly be recovered. There are two well-known solutions to the phase problem: holography and coherent diffraction  imaging (CDI). Both techniques have their pros and cons.

Through  integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data  inspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying  results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class,  ","32168452, 32168452, 32168452, 32168452, 32168452, 32168452","R packages for lipidomics: lipidomics, masspix, lipidms, lipidr and lipid mini-on.","32168452, 30500173, 28989334, 30977807",1.0,[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.],0.0

The  RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target  mRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin  expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. HuR bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin  translation. HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent  HuR phosphorylation. Reduced HuR phosphorylation by Chk2 silencing or by reduction of Chk2 through polyamine depletion decreased HuR-binding to the  occludin mRNA and repressed occludin translation, whereas Chk2 overexpression  enhanced (HuR/occludin mRNA) association and stimulated occludin expression. In  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.0,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.0
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,The DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning.," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning.

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no mention of desmin presence in plants. All mentioned muscle cells (Purkinje fibers, ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle, and smooth muscle) are from animals (bovine heart)."," Context: effect of phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation is the disassembly of desmin  filaments, while ubiquitylation of desmin leads to its degradation. The  regulation of the desmin filament network by phosphorylation and  ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological  processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle  atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding  partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all  minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based  on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a  large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.  ,  Context: genomes.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3.," Context:  INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.  ,  Context: There is an expanding role for interleukin (IL)-1 in diseases from gout to  cancer. More than any other cytokine family, the IL-1 family is closely linked  to innate inflammatory and immune responses. This linkage is because the  cytoplasmic segment of all members of the IL-1 family of receptors contains a  domain, which is highly homologous to the cytoplasmic domains of all toll-like  receptors (TLRs). This domain, termed ""toll IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain,"" signals as does the IL-1 receptors; therefore, inflammation due to the TLR and the IL-1  families is nearly the same. Fundamental responses such as the induction of  cyclo-oxygenase type 2, increased surface expression of cellular adhesion molecules and increased gene expression of a broad number of inflammatory  molecules characterizes IL-1 signal transduction as it does for TLR agonists.  IL-1β is the most studied member of the IL-1 family because of its role in  ,  Context: For many years, the innate immunity was of less interest than the adaptive  immunity because it was perceived to have secondary importance in the  functionality of the immune system. During the past decades, with the  advancement of knowledge about innate immune system, interest in innate immunity  has grown dramatically and thus its function has been extensively studied.  Innate immunity plays fundamental roles in the initiation and induction of  adaptive immune responses. It consists of several cells and receptors including  natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages (MQs), dendritic cells (DCs) and pattern  recognition receptors (PRRs). Two decades ago, Toll like receptors (TLRs) family was known as one of the important PRRs with unique functions especially in  protection against invading pathogens. Since the female reproductive tract has  access to the outside environment and has a unique interaction with different pathogens whether invading microorganisms or normal flora, allogenic sperm and  semi allogenic fetus, it has an essential need for effective immune responses.  It has therefore been suggested that TLRs may play important roles in the immune  ,  Context: cytoplasmic segment of all members of the IL-1 family of receptors contains a  domain, which is highly homologous to the cytoplasmic domains of all toll-like  receptors (TLRs).

IL-1β is the most studied member of the IL-1 family because of its role in mediating autoinflammatory disease. However, a role for IL-1α in disease is  being validated because of the availability of a neutralizing monoclonal  antibody to human IL-1α. There are presently three approved therapies for blocking IL-1 activity. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally  occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, which binds to the IL-1 receptor and  prevents the binding of IL-1β as well as IL-1α. Rilonacept is a soluble decoy  ,  Context:  Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit proteins and NELL1/2.," Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1.

Therefore, this factor has been  identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and  targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We  evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib  (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell  lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model.

This kinase, which is part of two protein complexes termed mTOR  complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), has a fundamental role in coordinating  anabolic and catabolic processes in response to growth factors and nutrients. Of  the two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 is by far the best characterized. When active, mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,Mediator is not mentioned in the provided contexts.," Context: genome-wide description of cohesin binding to meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A computer program, PeakFinder, enables flexible,  automated identification and annotation of cohesin binding peaks in ChIP chip  data. Cohesin sites are highly conserved in meiosis and mitosis, suggesting that  chromosomes share a common underlying structure during different developmental  programs. These sites occur with a semiperiodic spacing of 11 kb that correlates  with AT content. The number of sites correlates with chromosome size; however,  binding to neighboring sites does not appear to be cooperative. We observed a  very strong correlation between cohesin sites and regions between convergent transcription units. The apparent incompatibility between transcription and  cohesin binding exists in both meiosis and mitosis. Further experiments reveal  that transcript elongation into a cohesin-binding site removes cohesin. A negative correlation between cohesin sites and meiotic recombination sites  suggests meiotic exchange is sensitive to the chromosome structure provided by  cohesin. The genome-wide view of mitotic and meiotic cohesin binding provides an  ,  Context: Several reports from mammals indicate that an increase in the mutation rate in  late-replicating regions may, in part, be responsible for the observed genomic  heterogeneity in neutral substitution rates and levels of diversity, although  the mechanisms for this remain poorly understood. Recent evidence also suggests  that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. This then  raises the question as to whether a similar effect is operating across all  eukaryotes. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster  suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins  showing increased levels of diversity and divergence. Given the availability of genome-wide replication timing profiles for D. melanogaster, we now return to  this issue. Consistent with what is seen in other taxa, we find that divergence  at synonymous sites in exon cores, as well as divergence at putatively unconstrained intronic sites, is elevated in late-replicating regions. Analysis  of genes with low codon usage bias suggests a ∼30% difference in mutation rate  between the earliest and the latest replicating sequence. Intronic sequence  ,  Context: than they are to profiles from other organisms, and that closely related  organisms generally have more similar profiles than do distantly related  organisms. On this basis we refer to the collection (rho*XY) as the genome  signature. This paper identifies rho*XY extremes and compares genome signature  differences for a diverse range of eukaryotic species. Interpretations on the  mechanisms maintaining these profile differences center on genome-wide  replication, repair, DNA structures, and context-dependent mutational biases. It  is also observed that mitochondrial genome signature differences between species  parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences despite large differences between corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear signatures. The  genome signature differences also have implications for contrasts between  rodents and other mammals, and between monocot and dicot plants, as well as providing evidence for similarities among fungi and the diversity of protists.  ,  Context: with its inverted complement). Previous studies with respect to prokaryotes and  this study document that profiles of different DNA sequence samples (sample size  >/=50 kb) from the same organism are generally much more similar to each other  than they are to profiles from other organisms, and that closely related  organisms generally have more similar profiles than do distantly related  organisms.

This project attempts simultaneously to establish  a sound basis for the development of diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and  preventive medical applications. In Iran, current efforts focus on mapping the  proteome of the human Y chromosome. The male-specific region of the Y chromosome  (MSY) is unique in many aspects and comprises 95% of the chromosome's length.  The MSY continually retains its haploid state and is full of repeated sequences.  It is responsible for important biological roles such as sex determination and male fertility. Here, we present the most recent update of MSY protein-encoding  genes and their association with various traits and diseases including sex  determination and reversal, spermatogenesis and male infertility, cancers such as prostate cancers, sex-specific effects on the brain and behavior, and  graft-versus-host disease. We also present information available from RNA  sequencing, protein-protein interaction, post-translational modification of MSY  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are composed of isochores, i.e. long sequences relatively  homogeneous in GC content. In this paper, the isochore structure of Arabidopsis  thaliana genome has been studied using a windowless technique based on the Z  curve method and intuitive curves are drawn for all the five chromosomes. Using  these curves, we can calculate the GC content at any resolution, even at the  base level. It is observed that all the five chromosomes are composed of several GC-rich and AT-rich regions alternatively. Usually, these regions, named  'isochore-like regions', have large fluctuations in the GC content. Five  isochores with little fluctuations are also observed. Detailed analyses have been performed for these isochores. A GC-rich 'isochore-like region' and a  GC-isochore in chromosome II and IV, respectively, are the nucleolar organizer  regions (NORs), and genes located in the two regions prefer to use GC-ending  ","15309048, 22046001, 9294192, 9294192, 23253012, 15978039","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.","29209056, 26240385, 24824069, 27773677, 28575439, 27742736, 24998386, 33176147, 31209209, 31211995, 29157917",0.0,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1.],1.0
