What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Defective control of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma."," Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,I don't know the answer.," Context: remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system  and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation.

RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most  frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).," Context: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight  recordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low  availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is  recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,Raoultella terrigena," Context: Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as  gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep typically reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic  diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early  in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.

In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, IEGs (Immediate-Early Genes) create a ripple effect of transcriptional activation that extends to surrounding intergenic regions."," Context: primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.  Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all  transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive, slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma."," Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving  the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients with giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor who can undergo appropriate surgical  treatment. This represents a safe and reasonable approach to sustainably relieve  pain and other symptoms with giant hemophilic pseudotumor in the abdomen.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus.," Context: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol  (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  RESULTS: Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had  improved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance  visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. We noted a similar outcome after similar treatment applied in the left eye with  UDVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this case, the introduction of successful management of severe cornea abnormalities and scarring with the Athens Protocol may provide an  effective alternative to other existing surgical or medical options.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor."," Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.

Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA (cleavage and polyadenylation) during development, with over a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context: identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are  highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of  the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a  uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations  lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread  cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into the identities, formation, and evolution of zebrafish 3' UTRs provide a resource  for studying gene regulation during vertebrate development.  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum.," Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is seen endoscopically as dark spots in the duodenal  mucosa and is generally considered to be local deposition of iron from oral iron  intake. However, pseudomelanosis duodeni may be identified histologically even before it becomes endoscopically evident; iron stainability within the mucosa is  uneven and unpredictable, and multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron  intake may be associated. We reviewed 17 adult patients with histologically detected pseudomelanosis duodeni, their endoscopic appearances, iron  stainability, and clinical findings including oral iron and drug intake.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I don't know the answer.," Context: Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through  receptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate  variant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the  normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an  inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine.," Context: BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial  involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of  recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and  background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response  (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered  subcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox  proportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence.  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context: microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates  Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then,  induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"Yes, TAMs can be exploited for their antitumor effector functions, making them a potential target for anticancer therapy."," Context: progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education  toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment.

Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor).," Context:  Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  ,  Context: Proteasomes are multisubunit enzyme complexes. They contain three enzymatic  active sites which are termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like.  The elementary function of the proteasomes is degradation of damaged proteins.  Proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of damaged protein, which leads to  caspase activation and cell death. This relationship is used in cancer therapy.  Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  Carfilzomib belongs to the second generation of drugs, which was approved by the  US FDA in 2012. Currently in the study phase there are four new inhibitors: ixazomib (MLN9780/MLN2238), delanzomib (CEP-18770), oprozomib (ONX0912/PR-047)  and marizomib (NPI-0052).

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, which opposes DDK function. Additionally, Rif1 interacts with PP1 to prevent premature Mc"," Context: 1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that  Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at  late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Our results indicate that Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining  the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating  higher-order chromatin architecture.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein is a co-repressor that interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination."," Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing  ,  Context:  The development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing depends on its subdivision  into anterior and posterior compartments, which constitute two independent cell  lineages since their origin in the embryonic ectoderm. The anterior-posterior compartment boundary is the place where signaling by the Hedgehog pathway takes  place, and this requires pathway activation in anterior cells by ligand  expressed exclusively in posterior cells.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Diuretics and bisphosphonates are associated with drug-induced hypophosphatemia. Additionally, intravenous carboxymaltose iron is also mentioned as a cause of symptomatic hypophosphatemia in one patient case."," Context: Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia  frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context:  Hypophosphatemia is a relatively frequent and a potentially serious adverse drug  effect. Clinically it is characterized by bone pain and muscle weakness.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"Yes, H4K20 methylation is linked to DNA repair and DNA replication."," Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.

Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, according to the text, recent reports suggest increased levels of RNA editing in squids, and it is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods."," Context:  The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors."," Context:  We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?",No," Context: Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists.  PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells stably transfected with BRS-3 with IC50 values of  4.8 and >100μM, respectively.

METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ","7723058, 8411203","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"The CRSP/Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70."," Context: in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural  shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis.," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique  functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, overexpression of mutant α-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG  parameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-α2  binding partner.

Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ","27370569, 31151904",MethPed,27370569,1.0,[0.846 0.462],[0.012 0.   ],0.0

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,I don't know the answer.," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22," Context:  The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I don't know the answer.," Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation. However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we  investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs  via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal  xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal  cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and  matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were subcultured, purified, and verified by immunofluorescence. Migration, invasion,  and proliferation potentials were compared between the CAFs and NFs. A  co-culture of CAFs with HEp-2 cells and a co-injection of CAFs with HEp-2 cells in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted.

To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains.

CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to  cite this article: Nooh N.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,No," Context: oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is  possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.  ,  Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER).

However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine  HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.

Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,DNA thermodynamic stability," Context:  A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,No," Context:  We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context:  Transposable elements (TEs) are the main component of eukaryotic genomes.  Besides their impact on genome size, TEs are also functionally important as they  can alter gene expression and influence phenotypic variation. In plants, most top-down studies focus on extremely clear phenotypes such as the shape or the  color of individuals and do not explore fully the role of TEs in evolution.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all  minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based  on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a  large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.  ,  Context: on a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata  (Crochemore et al., 1998).

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,SpectralTAD and BBCAnalyzer," Context: BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial  role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies  (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of  topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  ,  Context: or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single  plot.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Oral," Context:  Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,I don't know the answer.," Context:  The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,The soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein family.," Context:  The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell  ,  Context: while limiting their peripheral toxicity. Such molecular vectors can pave the  way for the development of new classes of therapeutics, fighting against  protagonists of neoplastic development. In line with this concept, peptide  ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a  strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been  developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3)  receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic  pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med.  Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040). This compound has entered phase II clinical trials as an anti-angiogenic agent. Further studies have been directed to develop  molecular conjugates of the parent c[-RGDfK-] with conventional  chemotherapeutics or with labels for non-invasive imaging technologies. More recently, multimeric RGD containing compounds have been exploited to improve the  targeting potential as well as cell-membrane breaching, through  receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, according to the context, saracatinib inhibits Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, which suggests that it does not promote oncogenesis."," Context: Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the cross-talk and mediation of  many signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion,  migration, and tumorigenesis. Increased Src activity has been reported in many  types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been  identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and  targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We  evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib  (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell  lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,Abiraterone is a potent suppressor of cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-mediated androgen production. It also has activity against AR and 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydro," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone  ,  Context: production of intratumoral androgens are necessary. The introduction of  abiraterone, a potent suppressor of cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase-mediated androgen production, has heralded a new era in the  hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed.

The syndrome is inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of  the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the  deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered. Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum.

The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in  congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,No.," Context: Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to  those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature. Since  the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2)  release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial  ,  Context: Requirements of thyroxine increase in all conditions characterized by impaired  gastric acid secretion. Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of  drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption. In addition, a series of diseases  including celiac disease and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, as well  as nutritional habits may be important in patient control.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of  S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and protor."," Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."," Context: CONTEXT: The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is  incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed  the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally  been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Yes, ospemifene was effective in reducing dyspareunia (P = 0.0001) in postmenopausal women with vulvar and vaginal atrophy."," Context: following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells,  vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of  parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of  superficial cells significantly increased; and dyspareunia was significantly  reduced versus placebo (all P < 0.0001, except for dyspareunia: P = 0.0001).  Among the randomized women, 186 (61.4%) in the ospemifene group and 154 (51.0%)  in the placebo group reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Hot  flushes were the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event  (ospemifene 6.6% vs placebo 3.6%); only one participant discontinued in each group. As determined by the investigators, no serious adverse events related to  the study drug were reported.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes.," Context: organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus  contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals.  Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively  regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns  using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that  these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that  MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different  subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different  functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and  localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires  VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also  function as positive regulators of biological processes.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac  dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ","3850773, 22590623",Yes.,"8864644, 8761317, 3384188, 22402252, 3850773, 10359740",1.0,[1.  0.7],[0.124 0.091],1.0

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells.

It connects enhancers to promoters and regulates transcription by interacting with chromatin modifiers and transcription factor families at"," Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.  As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners.
