What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"No specific information about the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is provided. The text only mentions their involvement in mediating DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation, and regulation of gene expression as part of the cohesin complex"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.

IL-1β is the most studied member of the IL-1 family because of its role in mediating autoinflammatory disease. However, a role for IL-1α in disease is  being validated because of the availability of a neutralizing monoclonal  antibody to human IL-1α. There are presently three approved therapies for blocking IL-1 activity. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally  occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, which binds to the IL-1 receptor and  prevents the binding of IL-1β as well as IL-1α. Rilonacept is a soluble decoy  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis.

HDAC6 is a tubulin deacetylase that plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in," Context: The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning.

HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only  pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule  stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions.  ,  Context: The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C In particular, the methylation states of H3K4, H3K36 and H4K20 have been associated with establishing active, repressed or poised origins depending on the timing and extent of methylation. 5BrC and 5ClC may cause aberrant methylation of cytosine during DNA replication and mimic the endogenous methylation signal associated with gene silencing.","23924899, 20735237, 27268234, 23345616, 27131378, 23754963, 24013172, 26598646, 24049080, 23152447",0.0,[1. 1. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1.],0.0

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.

In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and  transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs showed that acidic keratins  and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin  vitro. In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm filaments and protofilarnents.

Hydroxyurea was then introduced at the initial dose of 10 mg/kg, and  as the hydroxyurea dosage increased, the number or length of priapism episodes  decreased. One to two months after the maximal dose (20-35 mg/kg) was introduced, the episodes disappeared. In two patients, we were forced to  administer over 30 mg hydroxyurea/kg to abort the episodes, and, in another  patient, 25 mg/kg was necessary. All patients present normal sexual activity.
