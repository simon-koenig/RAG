What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ","19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",0.0,[1. 0.],[1. 0.],0.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,There is no mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. The text only discusses their simultaneous blocking reducing cell proliferation and being a potential therapeutic target in cancers with inactivating alterations of STAG2.," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context: Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse  Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state.

Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1].

List markers for autophagy.,"Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) are used as marker genes for detecting autophagy. Additionally, specific proteins involved in autophagy can be detected by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of patient tissues."," Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context: chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2  were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a  region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating  DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator  that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme  responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication  although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the  absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect  regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates  with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to  prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, resulting in co-upregulation of surrounding genes. This is accompanied by elevated acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 along with the IEG induction"," Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: is started by activation of the enhancer through the binding of transcription  factors. Accordingly, stochastic transcription during latency might reflect  episodes of enhancer activation by the ""noise"" activity of intrinsic  transcription factors. In addition to ie1/3, the enhancer controls gene ie2,  which has its own promoter, P(2), and is transcribed in opposite direction. We  show here that ie2 is also randomly transcribed during latency. Notably,  however, ie1 and ie2 were found to be expressed independently. We infer from  this finding that expression of the major IE genes is regulated asymmetrically  and asynchronously via the combined control unit P(1/3) -E-P(2). Our data are consistent with a stochastic nature of enhancer action as it is proposed by the  ""binary"" or probability model.

The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection.

This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor. Additionally, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates STAT3 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription."," Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an  inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied.

It's a disorder where inflammation occurs in different parts of the body, putting"," Context: can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune  features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly  understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized  SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with  MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell  activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had  SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C  patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that  correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained  immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time,  concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures  that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation  and trajectory of MIS-C.  ,  Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ","32995826, 33679227","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection.

This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine.," Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are MEC-17 (acetyltransferase), SIRT2 (deacetylase), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase and also functions as a tubulin de"," Context: α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes.  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3).

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be both beneficial and detrimental in cancer treatment. They can blunt the efficacy of cancer treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, but they also have pro-resolving functions that can promote inflammation resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments when stimulated"," Context: Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the  growth of, the cancer cells. Molecularly targeted therapy is the modern  expression of this paradigm. Increasingly, however, the realization that the  cancer has co-opted the normal cells of the stroma for its own survival has led  to the concept that the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be targeted for  effective therapy. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments.

Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and  Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role  of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to  the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.  ,  Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification.

The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction.

On CMR,  patients who presented with dyspnoea had greater left ventricular volumes (both  p < 0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p < 0.0001)  than age-matched, healthy controls.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) in mammalian cells, including humans."," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA.

It tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes, thereby controlling the"," Context: Chromosomal DNA replication involves the coordinated activity of hundreds to  thousands of replication origins. Individual replication origins are subject to  epigenetic regulation of their activity during S-phase, resulting in  differential efficiencies and timings of replication initiation during S-phase.  This regulation is thought to involve chromatin structure and organization into  timing domains with differential ability to recruit limiting replication  factors. Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of  replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells. However, previous  studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1's role in controlling replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci.

These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are  measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is  particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes.

The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"No, deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. However, it is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains."," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group."," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,"Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single pill, known as Avandamet."," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) can be used in therapeutics by loading it onto a mutated donor splice site to correct exon skipping caused by mutations. This approach has been shown to rescue splicing impaired by different types of mutations in genes such," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: A significant proportion of disease-causing mutations affect precursor-mRNA  splicing, inducing skipping of the exon from the mature transcript. Using F9  exon 5, CFTR exon 12 and SMN2 exon 7 models, we characterized natural mutations  associated to exon skipping in Haemophilia B, cystic fibrosis and spinal  muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively, and the therapeutic splicing rescue by  using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). In minigene expression systems, loading of  U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1 snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete  ","19219028, 22362925","Until now, two main types of therapeutic strategies have been developed using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA): 1) Production of a defective, but partially functional protein, with the help of exon skipping, through modulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and 2) Correction of pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations with the use of U1 snRNA adapted to the defective variant.","22968481, 21326217, 20869034, 22362925, 21520335, 22454066, 22454067, 19219028",,,,

The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria.

According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP-Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a.

Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is demonstrated by the fact that EVs were purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,I am uncertain about which specific kinase regulates stress granule biogenesis as it is not mentioned in the provided context.," Context: may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of  mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant  protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the  effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions  of oxidative stress. RESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress  granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  ,  Context: Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins  that form when translation initiation is inhibited. Stress granules are thought  to form by protein-protein interactions of RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate  RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.

In the first section of our review, we consider the  classical process of mRNA 3'-terminus formation, which involves the cleavage of  the transcript synthesized by RNA polymerase II and the associated poly(A) tail  synthesis by canonical polyadenylate polymerase. Nucleotide sequences needed for  mRNA cleavage and poly(A) tail synthesis, in particular the AAUAAA  polyadenylation signal, as well as numerous proteins and their complexes  involved in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, is described in detail.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express Folate Receptor alpha (FRα). It allows for," Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been tested for the construction of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices, dental implants."," Context: 3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or  metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional  object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process  contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional  object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in  engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in  printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the  ,  Context:  Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2, as it shares a high level of homology with Upc2p, particularly at the carboxy terminus where 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the"," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.

All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, there is no indication in the provided information that AGY has any relation to antidiuretic functions or can be used as a replacement therapy for it. The text only discusses AGY's potential benefits for patients with celiac disease on a"," Context: is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.  ,  Context: acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, a VHDL version of a reconfigurable systolic architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA to efficiently treat several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, including global and local sequence alignment."," Context: Reconfigurable systolic arrays can be adapted to efficiently resolve a wide  spectrum of computational problems; parallelism is naturally explored in  systolic arrays and reconfigurability allows for redefinition of the  interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments.

Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby keeping p53 levels in check and promoting cell survival."," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ","19884656, 23223443","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",,,,
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"According to evaluations of DNA deformation energy, the major determinant of nucleosome positioning is the DNA sequence itself."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: dynamics study of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing  structures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops.

All variants  influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the largest effect on  energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of allosteric  networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take advantage of  stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics throughout the complex. Furthermore, we show that posttranslational modifications are enriched  at key locations in these networks. Taken together, these results provide, to  our knowledge, new insights into the relationship between the structure, dynamics, and function of the nucleosome core particle and chromatin fibers, and  how they are influenced by chromatin remodeling factors.

RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

CONTACT: alice.heliou@lix.polytechnique.fr or solon.pissis@kcl.ac.uk.  ,  Context: existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the  data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow  ","28407038, 19426495",emMAW,28407038,,,,

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded by a locus on the X chromosome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2.

Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,No information is provided about thyronamines in the given text.," Context: The worldwide prevalence of obesity-associated pathologies, including type 2  diabetes, requires thorough investigation of mechanisms and interventions.  Recent studies have highlighted thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives as  potential agents able to counteract such pathologies. In this study, in rats  receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk daily  administration of a naturally occurring iodothyronine, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), on the gastrocnemius muscle metabolic/structural phenotype and insulin  signaling. The HFD-induced increases in muscle levels of fatty acid translocase  (3-fold; P<0.05) and TGs (2-fold, P<0.05) were prevented by T2 (each; P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation levels (∼2.5-fold;  P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 induced these effects while sparing muscle mass and without  cardiac hypertrophy.

The effects of these interventions depend on weight loss per  se, changes in fat distribution without weight loss and/or direct effects on  adipose tissue inflammation.Weight loss, as a result of diet, pharmacology and  surgery, positively influences plasma adipokines and systemic inflammation.  Several classes of drugs influence systemic inflammation directly through their  anti-inflammatory actions. PPAR-γ agonism positively influences adipose tissue  inflammation in several classes of intervention such as the thiazolidinediones  and perhaps salicylates, CB1-antagonists and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  Furthermore, within drug classes there are differential effects of individual pharmacologic agents on adipose tissue function.It can be concluded that several  commonly used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have  unintended influences on adipose tissue function.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting  HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas  HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A expression. Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 regulate HIF-1α translation, VEGF-A is  primarily under the control of 4E-BP1/eIF4E. S6K1 inhibition reduces HIF-1α but  not VEGF-A expression, suggesting that mTORC1 mediates VEGF-A expression via both HIF-1α-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our work has important  implications for the treatment of vascularised tumours, where mTORC1 acts as a  central mediator of STAT3, HIF-1α, VEGF-A and angiogenesis via multiple  signalling mechanisms.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"There is no national screening programme established for prostate cancer in the United Kingdom, despite screening being available for many years."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,Selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease.," Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals.  Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively  regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns  using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that  these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that  MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different  subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different  functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and  localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires  VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also  function as positive regulators of biological processes.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 regulates inflammation and metabolism and has been  linked to the pathogenesis of heart disease. TLR4 is upregulated in diabetic  cardiomyocytes, and we examined the role of TLR4 in modulating cardiac fatty  acid (FA) metabolism and the pathogenesis of diabetic heart disease in nonobese  diabetic (NOD) mice. Both wild-type (WT) NOD and TLR4-deficient NOD animals had  increased plasma triglyceride levels after the onset of diabetes. However, by  comparison, TLR4-deficient NOD mouse hearts had lower triglyceride accumulation  in the early stages of diabetes, which was associated with a reduction in  myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and JNK levels but increased  phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Oleic acid treatment in H9C2  cardiomyocytes also led to cellular lipid accumulation, which was attenuated by TLR4 small interfering RNA.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node.
