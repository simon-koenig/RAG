What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Defective control of the histone code, including copy number aberrations of genes controlling H"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.

Well-known  oncohistones, with mutations on both H3.1 and H3.3, include H3K36M in  chondroblastoma, H3K27M in glioma, and H3G34 mutations that exist in bone  cancers and gliomas. Oncohistone expression can lead to epigenome/transcriptome  reprogramming and eventually to oncogenesis. The H3K27M, H3G34V/R, and H3K36M  histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.

Therefore this system can serve as a platform for mechanistic studies on the  circRNA biogenesis and its function.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Here, we  specifically focus on tubulin acetylation from its discovery to recent studies  that provide new insights into how it is regulated in health and disease and how  it impacts microtubule functions. Even though new mechanisms involving tubulin  acetylation are regularly being uncovered, the molecular links between its location inside the microtubule lumen and its regulators and effectors is still  poorly understood. This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin  acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and  signalling. It also points out that tubulin acetylation should no longer be seen  as a passive marker of microtubule stability, but as a broad regulator of  microtubule functions.

Higher levels of anxiety  and vulnerability to stress were associated with increased risk of AD and more  rapid decline in global cognition, with no effects for the other four trait  components. In analyses of specific cognitive systems, neuroticism subscales  were related to decline in episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual  speed, but not in semantic memory or visuospatial ability. No component of neuroticism was related to the neuropathologic lesions most commonly associated  with late-life dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism's association with late-life dementia mainly reflects vulnerability to stress and anxiety and their correlation with decline in the  ability to process and retain new information.  ,  Context: MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD), change  in global and specific cognitive functions, and postmortem measures of plaques  and tangles, cerebral infarction, and Lewy bodies.

Using EM and single-particle  reconstruction techniques, we recently completed a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med. Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures.

Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62).

RESULTS: Exposure of GSCs to AZD2014 resulted in the inhibition of mTORC1 and 2  activities. Based on clonogenic survival analysis, addition of AZD2014 to culture media 1 hour before irradiation enhanced the radiosensitivity of CD133+  and CD15+ GSC cell lines.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.," Context: In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.

The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection.

TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage  with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.  ,  Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations.

Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus  contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans.

Testing a  subset of 57 of these genes by RT-PCR and sequencing, we confirmed expression  for 24 (42%) of them. mGene missed 300 annotated genes, out of which 205 were  unconfirmed. RT-PCR testing of 24 of these genes resulted in a success rate of  merely 8%. These findings suggest that even the gene catalog of a well-studied  organism such as C. elegans can be substantially improved by mGene's  predictions. We also provide gene predictions for the four nematodes C.  briggsae, C. brenneri, C. japonica, and C. remanei. Comparing the resulting  proteomes among these organisms and to the known protein universe, we identified many species-specific gene inventions. In a quality assessment of several  available annotations for these genomes, we find that mGene's predictions are  most accurate.  ,  Context: predicted genes were not contained in the current genome annotation.
