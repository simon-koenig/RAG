HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.

In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and high Mediator binding density defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that ,  Context: transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. ,  Context: As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity. ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain ,  Context: function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles. ,  Context: function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Colistin is mentioned alongside other antibiotics such as tetracycline antibiotics, amikacin, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, suggesting that it may be an antibiotic. Additionally, it is used to treat infections caused by bacteria"," Context: antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs. ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin).
