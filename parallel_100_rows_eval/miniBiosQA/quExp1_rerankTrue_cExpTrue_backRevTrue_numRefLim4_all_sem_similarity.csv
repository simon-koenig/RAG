What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Defective control of the histone code contributes to the development of medulloblastoma"," Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context:  DNA methylation plays a significant role in the expression of the genetic code  and affects early growth and development through its influence on gene  expression. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the methylation marks through cell division. However, the de novo  methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, can also contribute to the maintenance of  the methylation pattern. Manipulation of these enzymes, especially Dnmt1, provides a means to alter DNA methylation levels. Manipulation of the DNA  methylation pattern of somatic cells will allow a better understanding of the  different molecular process associated with chromatin structure and gene  ,  Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity and encode mutually exclusive cohesin subunits that retain partially overlapping functions. They are involved in several meiosis stages and cooperate to maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of me," Context:  STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member, STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement  ,  Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  ,  Context: STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"There is a consistent association between long-term use of mobile and cordless phones and glioma (a type of brain tumor), but no association with meningioma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, emitted by these phones"," Context: To identify novel genetic loci influencing interindividual variation in red  blood cell (RBC) traits in African-Americans, we conducted a genome-wide  association study (GWAS) in 2315 individuals, divided into discovery (n = 1904)  and replication (n = 411) cohorts. The traits included hemoglobin concentration  (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean  corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration  (MCHC). Patients were participants in the electronic MEdical Records and  GEnomics (eMERGE) network and underwent genotyping of ~1.2 million  single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the Illumina Human1M-Duo array. Association analyses were performed adjusting for age, sex, site, and population  stratification. Three loci previously associated with resistance to malaria-HBB  (11p15.4), HBA1/HBA2 (16p13.3), and G6PD (Xq28)-were associated (P ≤ 1 × 10(-6)) with RBC traits in the discovery cohort. The loci replicated in the replication  cohort (P ≤ 0.02), and were significant at a genome-wide significance level (P <  5 × 10(-8)) in the combined cohort. The proportions of variance in RBC traits  ,  Context: alterations. The KMPlotter online tool, METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets were used  to associate gene signatures with clinical outcome. RESULTS: 1564 upregulated genes were identified as differentially expressed  between normal and basal-like tumors. Of these, 16 genes associated with immune  function were linked with clinical outcome. HLA-C, HLA-F, HLA-G and TIGIT were  associated with both improved relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival  (OS). The combination of HLA-F/TIGIT and HLA-C/HLA-F/TIGIT showed the most  favorable outcome (HR for RFS 0.44, p<0.001; HR for OS 0.22, p<0.001; and HR for  RFS 0.46, p<0.001; HR for OS 0.15, p<0.001; respectively). The association of HLA-C/HLA-F with outcome was confirmed using the METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets.  No copy number alterations of these genes were identified. CONCLUSION: We describe a gene signature associated with immune function and favorable outcome in basal-like breast cancer. Incorporation of this signature  in prospective studies may help to stratify risk of early stage TNBC.  ,  Context: unknown. Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide  identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of  Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1  interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry. Of the  621 high confidence Pfh1-binding sites in wild type cells, about 40% were sites  of fork slowing (as marked by high DNA polymerase occupancy) and/or DNA damage  (as marked by high levels of phosphorylated H2A). The replication and integrity  of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes, and  nucleosome depleted regions were particularly Pfh1-dependent. The association of Pfh1 with genomic integrity at highly transcribed genes was S phase dependent,  and thus unlikely to be an artifact of high transcription rates. Although Pfh1  affected replication and suppressed DNA damage at discrete sites throughout the genome, Pfh1 and the replicative DNA polymerase bound to similar extents to both  Pfh1-dependent and independent sites, suggesting that Pfh1 is proximal to the  replication machinery during S phase. Consistent with this interpretation, Pfh1  ,  Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized  by abnormal deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in many regions of the central  and peripheral nervous systems. Accumulating evidence suggests that the α-synuclein pathology initiates in a few discrete regions and spreads to larger  areas in the nervous system. Recent pathological studies of PD patients have  raised the possibility that the enteric nervous system is one of the initial sites of α-synuclein aggregation and propagation.

Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.

Recent  studies have demonstrated that the collection of trait-associated SNPs can be  exploited to indicate whether a given genomic interval or intervals are likely  to be functionally connected with certain phenotypes or diseases.

The annotatr package reports  all intersections of regions and annotations, giving a better understanding of the genomic context of the regions. A variety of graphics functions are  implemented to easily plot numerical or categorical data associated with the  regions across the annotations, and across annotation intersections, providing insight into how characteristics of the regions differ across the annotations.

Here, we show that a subset of circRNAs is translated  in vivo. By performing ribosome footprinting from fly heads, we demonstrate that  a group of circRNAs is associated with translating ribosomes. Many of these  ribo-circRNAs use the start codon of the hosting mRNA, are bound by  membrane-associated ribosomes, and have evolutionarily conserved termination  codons. In addition, we found that a circRNA generated from the muscleblind  locus encodes a protein, which we detected in fly head extracts by mass  spectrometry. Next, by performing in vivo and in vitro translation assays, we show that UTRs of ribo-circRNAs (cUTRs) allow cap-independent translation.  Moreover, we found that starvation and FOXO likely regulate the translation of a  circMbl isoform. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for translation of circRNAs, revealing the existence of an unexplored layer of gene activity.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs"," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all  ,  Context:  Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) causes persistent neoplasms in healthy and  immunocompromised people. Its ability to persist likely is due to its arsenal of  viral immunoevasion proteins. For example, the MCV MC159 protein inhibits TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis. The MC159 protein is a viral FLIP  and, as such, possesses two tandem death effector domains (DEDs). We show in  this article that, in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells, the expression of wild-type MC159 or a mutant MC159 protein containing the first DED (MC159 A)  inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB, or NF-κB activated by PMA or MyD88 overexpression,  whereas a mutant protein lacking the first DED (MC159 B) did not. We  ,  Context: between species can be used to predict protein function more reliably than  co-expression in a single species. Here we examine whether co-expression across  multiple species is also a better prioritizer of disease genes than is  co-expression between human genes alone. RESULTS: We use co-expression data from yeast (S. cerevisiae), nematode worm (C.  elegans), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), mouse and human and find that the use of  evolutionary conservation can indeed improve the predictive value of  co-expression. The effect that genes causing the same disease have higher  co-expression than do other genes from their associated disease loci, is significantly enhanced when co-expression data are combined across  evolutionarily distant species. We also find that performance can vary  significantly depending on the co-expression datasets used, and just using more data does not necessarily lead to better prioritization. Instead, we find that  dataset quality is more important than quantity, and using a consistent  microarray platform per species leads to better performance than using more  ,  Context:  LESSONS LEARNED: The fibrolamellar carcinoma-associated DNAJB1-PRKACA gene  fusion transcript RNA codes for the catalytic domain of protein kinase A and,  thus, overexpression of Aurora kinase A.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,There is no mention of Hemophilic Pseudotumor in the provided context.," Context: patients have undergone endovascular CCSVI procedures. Such procedures include  angioplasty or stent placement in jugular and azygous veins. The safety and  efficacy of these procedures is unknown, but not without risk.  METHODS: Chart and patient review of five patients with confirmed MS followed in  Calgary were undertaken after patients came to medical attention by referral or  admission secondary to complications believed to be associated with CCSVI  procedures.  RESULTS: Complications upon investigation and review included internal jugular  vein stent thrombosis, cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, stent migration, cranial  nerve injury and injury associated with venous catheterization. CONCLUSIONS: As the debate about CCSVI and its relationship to MS continues, the  complications and risks associated with venous stenting and angioplasty in  jugular and azygous veins are becoming clearer.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in fine-tuning the level of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. They can also function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermedi"," Context: It is now clear that there is a diversity of circular RNAs in biological  systems. Circular RNAs can be produced by the direct ligation of 5' and 3' ends  of linear RNAs, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, or by  ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome.

The levels of the cell  cycle CDKs are generally constant and their activities are controlled by cyclins, proteins whose levels oscillate during each cell cycle. Additional CDK  family members were subsequently discovered that play significant roles in a  wide range of activities including the control of gene transcription, metabolism, and neuronal function. In response to mitogenic stimuli, cells in  the G1 phase of the cell cycle produce cyclins of the D type that activate  CDK4/6. These activated enzymes catalyze the monophosphorylation of the  ,  Context: The fact that histones are modified by acetylation has been known for almost 30  years. The recent identification of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation  has revealed a broader use of this modification than was suspected previously.  Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including  transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation  regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the  bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling  domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to  phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate  specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules.," Context: Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the  transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the  development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here  I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure  chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells  (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing.

IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively.

The mutated form of the IDH1 enzyme produces a metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), which is thought to play a role in the formation and progression of  acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gliomas and other cancers. Elevated 2-HG levels interfere with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, thereby  contributing to oncogenesis. Ivosidenib targets the IDH1 metabolic pathway to  prevent a build-up of the oncometabolite 2-HG.

To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, Cseq-Simulator was developed as a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data.

Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.

Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of  propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a dodecameric enzyme composed of two different  proteins alpha-PCC and beta-PCC, nuclear encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes,  respectively.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,TORC1 regulates stress granule biogenesis upon heat stress.," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress.

Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to  cellular stress. We also show that the RNA binding activity of the Rbfox family  protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the  role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to  identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a  subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of  Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1  mRNA and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure. Our  study proposes a novel function for Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules.  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ","18775331, 18775331, 28894257, 22727621",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010,0.593,[0.618 0.618 0.539 0.594],[0.604 0.604 0.59  0.747],0.617

To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: engineering.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context: duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The  combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the  major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus  yeast sterol.  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,Mouse origin.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates embryonic development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby promoting"," Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes.

The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR.

The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic  fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ","23401122, 23223443, 23223443, 19884656","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.687,[0.478 0.547 0.547 0.503],[0.505 0.635 0.635 0.8  ],0.611

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning.

We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood.

As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration).

We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis.

The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease."," Context: the medical literature suggests that an imbalance between thyroid hormones and  the dopaminergic system underpins WED pathophysiology. In this article, we  present evidence that this imbalance may also mediate transient WED during  pregnancy. It is possible that the main hormonal alteration responsible for  transient WED of pregnancy is the excessive modulation of dopamine release in  the pituitary stalk by estradiol. The reduced quantities of dopamine then cause  decreased modulation of thyrotropin, leading to enhanced thyroid axis activity  and subsequent WED symptoms. Iron deficiency may also be a predisposing factor  for WED during pregnancy, as it can both diminish dopamine and increase thyroid  hormone.  ,  Context: Perchlorate has been detected in groundwater in many parts of the United States,  and recent detection in vegetable and dairy food products indicates that  contamination by perchlorate is more widespread than previously thought.  Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of the sodium iodide symporter, the  thyroid cell-surface protein responsible for transporting iodide from the plasma  into the thyroid.

Congenital  hypothyroidism affects 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 infants, and 15% of these cases  have been attributed to genetic defects. Our objective in this review is to identify genetic biomarkers that would help define subpopulations sensitive to  environmental perchlorate exposure. We review the literature to identify genetic  defects involved in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from circulation into the thyroid cell,  defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell to the follicular lumen  (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification.

Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.," Context:  Fingolimod (Gilenya; FTY720), a synthetic compound based on the fungal secondary  metabolite myriocin (ISP-I), is a potent immunosuppressant that was approved  (September 2010) by the U.S. FDA as a new treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod was synthesized by the research group of Tetsuro Fujita at Kyoto  University in 1992 while investigating structure-activity relationships of  derivatives of the fungal metabolite ISP-I, isolated from Isaria sinclairii.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node.

This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: cell type dependent manner. S1P receptors have become an attractive  pharmacological target to interfere with S1P-mediated cellular responses, which  contribute to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pioneering in this  field was the synthesis of FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya®) from myriocin, one of  the metabolites of the fungus Isaria sinclairii known from traditional Chinese  medicine for its antibacterial and energy boosting effect. Fingolimod turned out  as a very potent immunomodulatory agent that subsequently passed all clinical  trials successfully and is now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting  multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologically, fingolimod was characterized as a non-selective agonist of all of the S1P receptors (S1PR), with the exception of  S1P2, and in addition, as a selective S1P1 functional antagonist by induction of  irreversible S1P1 internalization and degradation. Since proper lymphocyte trafficking depends on the expression of S1P1 on lymphocytes, the degradation of  S1P1 leads to trapping and accumulation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid  tissue, and consequently to a depletion of lymphocytes from the blood.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters and plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development. It organizes genomes around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity, with high Mediator binding density defining super enhancers that regulate cell"," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.  ,  Context:  Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four  modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM). Previous work suggests  regulatory roles for Tail and CKM, but an integrated model for these activities is lacking. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits  in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape  is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM.
