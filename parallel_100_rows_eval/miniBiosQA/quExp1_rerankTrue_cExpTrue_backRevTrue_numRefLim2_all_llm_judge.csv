What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it may play a role in the development of Group 3 and Group 4 tumors. Specifically, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ","23179372, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",1.0,[1. 0.],[1. 0.],0.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The text does not mention the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. It only discusses their involvement in cancer, specifically as tumour suppressors and potential therapeutic targets."," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types.

Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area.," Context:  Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. The  motor impairments of Parkinson's disease are caused by the loss of dopaminergic  neurons in the substantia nigra and associated with the appearance of fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) called Lewy bodies. Approximately 90% of α-syn  deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast,  only 4% or less of total α-syn is phosphorylated at this residue in the normal brain. This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn leads  to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in  Parkinson's disease.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have shown limited therapeutic efficacy as targets for cancer therapy, although trials are still underway with combination therapies."," Context: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune  cells in tumors. TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A high TAM  infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: cells in the TME. During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can  either directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly  recruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the  tumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to  exhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression,  metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting TAMs has emerged as a  strategy for cancer therapy. To date, TAM targeting strategies have focused on  macrophage depletion and inhibition of their recruitment into the TME. However,  these strategies have shown limited therapeutic efficacy, although trials are still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies.

Over the  past few decades, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma has increased gradually  in most countries as the most frequently occurring histological type, displacing  SQ. Adenocarcinoma is the predominant type of lung cancer among lifelong  non-smokers and among females. Especially in East Asian countries, the cause(s) of the increase in adenocarcinomas are not clear. Several genetic mutations  specific to lung adenocarcinomas have been found, representing attractive  targets for molecular therapy. Recently, the pathological classification of lung adenocarcinoma was revised by integrating the newer clinical and biological  knowledge concerning this prevailing type. Additional epidemiological,  pathological and genetic studies are required to better understand this type of  lung cancer.  ,  Context: their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs.," Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: protein coding sequences is a result of both mutation and selection pressures.  Thus, there are two different ways of superposition of the sense strand, on the  leading or lagging strand. Besides many other implications of these two possible  situations, one seems to be very important - because of the asymmetric  replication-associated mutation pressure, the mutation rate of genes depends on  their location. Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under  experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and  the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the  leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome. We have found that the best survival strategy for the majority of genes is to sometimes switch  between DNA strands. Paradoxically, this strategy results in higher substitution  rates but remains in agreement with observations in bacterial genomes that such inversions are very frequent and divergence rate between homologs lying on  different DNA strands is very high.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before  vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed  for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One  hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive  and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was observed in 56.4% of FR-positive lesions versus 20.7% of FR-negative lesions (P  < 0.001).

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating.

Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains.

Describe OligoSTORM,There is no mention of OligoSTORM in the provided context. I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM refers to.," Context: Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is continuously being damaged by endogenous  processes such as metabolism or by exogenous events such as radiation. The  specific phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine residue 139, described as  γ-H2AX, is an excellent indicator or marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).  The yield of γ-H2AX (foci) is shown to have some correlation with the dose of  radiation or other DSB-causing agents.

Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential  tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to  image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of γ-H2AX foci formation  after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured  illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and  HyVolution 2.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,"I am uncertain about which CYP450 enzyme is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market. The provided information does not mention this specific detail, and I do not have enough data to provide an accurate answer."," Context:  Cytochrome P450 (P450) 17A enzymes play a critical role in the oxidation of the  steroids progesterone (Prog) and pregnenolone (Preg) to glucocorticoids and  androgens. In mammals, a single enzyme, P450 17A1, catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylation and a subsequent 17α,20-lyase reaction with both Prog and  Preg. Teleost fish contain two 17A P450s; zebrafish P450 17A1 catalyzes both  17α-hydroxylation and lyase reactions with Prog and Preg, and P450 17A2 is more efficient in pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation but does not catalyze the lyase  reaction, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. P450 17A2 binds all substrates  and products, although more loosely than P450 17A1. Pulse-chase and kinetic  ,  Context: Patients with cardiovascular diseases are often treated by concurrent multiple  drug therapy. It is therefore plausible that with an increasing number of drugs  the risk of drug interactions increases. Such interactions can be either  pharmacodynamic (and are due to the mechanism of the administered drugs) or they  can be pharmacokinetic (resulting in a reduction or enhancement of drug  elimination). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be either due to interactions at  the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (most important cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzymes) or interactions at the level of drug transporter proteins (for example  P-glycoprotein (MDR1)). It is important to distinguish between both mechanisms because interactions at transporter proteins can be attributed to those drugs  that are not enzymatically metabolized.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.0,[0. 0.],[0. 0.],0.0
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"According to recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization, the DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,I am uncertain about which R packages have been developed for studying TADs as there is no mention of specific R packages in the provided context.," Context: explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C  and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167,  DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between  TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly  enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein  Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs  harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw)  predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene  chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, an intracellular Ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction."," Context: apoptosis. Inhibition of AMPK by overexpression of a cardiac-specific DN-AMPK  gene reduced cardiomyocyte autophagy, exacerbated cardiac dysfunctions, and  increased mortality in diabetic mice. Finally, chronic metformin therapy  significantly enhanced autophagic activity and preserved cardiac functions in  diabetic OVE26 mice but not in DN-AMPK diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased AMPK activity and subsequent reduction in cardiac  autophagy are important events in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  Chronic AMPK activation by metformin prevents cardiomyopathy by upregulating  autophagy activity in diabetic OVE26 mice. Thus, stimulation of AMPK may represent a novel approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may  result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with  depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction.
