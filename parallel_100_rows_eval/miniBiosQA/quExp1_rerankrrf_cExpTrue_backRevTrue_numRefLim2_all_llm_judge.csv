What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and carcinogenesis. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ","19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",0.0,[1. 0.],[1. 0.],0.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that STAG3 is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin complex, suggesting that different ST"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are  found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member,  STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"There is no mention of glioblastoma in the provided context. However, there is a mention of glioma, which shows an odds ratio (OR) of 1.15 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.65-"," Context: type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave  increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following  latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association  between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the  initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: AS structure and properties have been extensively studied, it is possible to  predict the consequences of the splicing out of the two aforesaid exons.

Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection.

We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include ATG12 and LC3 conjugation systems. Additionally, PI(3)-binding proteins are also involved in the autophagy process."," Context: Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a dynamic process for degradation of cytosolic  components. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions,  and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system  responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence  factors for blocking autophagy, whereas others utilize some autophagy components  for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described.

Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation.

What is the purpose of HaploReg v4?,HaploReg V4.1 was used to understand functional annotation on important SNV.," Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroinflammation is an important mediator of the  pathogenesis of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic  mutations such as C9orf72 have begun to define the numerous cell autonomous  pathways that initiate motor neuron injury. Yet, it is the signalling to  surrounding glia and peripherally derived immune cells that initiates the  noncell autonomous inflammatory process and promotes self-propagating motor  neuron cell death. The purpose of this review is to explore the systemic  immune/inflammatory contributions to the pathogenesis of ALS: what are the  peripheral pro-inflammatory signatures, what initiates their presence and do they represent potential therapeutic targets. RECENT FINDINGS: In ALS, motor neuron cell death is initiated by multiple cell  autonomous pathways leading to misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, altered mitochondria, impaired autophagy and altered RNA metabolism, which collectively  promote noncell autonomous inflammatory reactivity. The resulting disease is  characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as peripherally  ,  Context: Jiangsu Province and Jiangsu Province Hospital from 2003 to 2009.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the study, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress actually contributes to genomic instability by compromising the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to a mutator phenotype in colon adenomas."," Context: to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events  and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus, such as immediate-early genes (IEGs), frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This is accompanied by co-upregulation of neighbouring genes and even activation of"," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a condition that mimics true tumors, such as chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, or synovial sarcoma. It can be confirmed by biopsy and is often associated with muscle hematom"," Context: pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving  the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal  pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients with giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor who can undergo appropriate surgical  treatment. This represents a safe and reasonable approach to sustainably relieve  pain and other symptoms with giant hemophilic pseudotumor in the abdomen. Perioperative coagulation factor replacement therapy is also of great  significance in reducing the risks and complications.  ,  Context: Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and  proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a  hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best solution. As alternatives, there are curettage and filling with cancellous bone  and radiotherapy (when surgery is contraindicated). Preoperative arterial  embolization (ideally 2 weeks before surgery) helps control intraoperative bleeding during surgery for giant pelvic pseudotumors.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription."," Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected.

Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine-tuning the level of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs.," Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated  ,  Context: It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost  always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to  produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding  genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic  repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional  ","24339831, 26442181","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of conserved, endogenous non-coding RNAs that are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. including cancer","34110722, 28969093, 34699790, 30791568, 28082450, 33065239, 32059672, 33715625, 30550956, 32667692, 33649838, 34296749, 31897908, 31832126, 33835457, 34542406, 29349062, 29387208, 31178190, 27616979, 33537235, 28634583, 31998941, 28018143, 34535136, 34100450, 32018039, 34258296",0.0,[1. 0.],[1. 0.],0.0
Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,X-ray free electron laser is used in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography for ab initio structural determination.," Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity.

It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses  and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels.

This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant).

AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"According to the study, the Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world."," Context: both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and  flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of  wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do  not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue  virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a  human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and  capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause  widespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential,  these viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because  some of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious,  special containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,"Rilonacept targets interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors, specifically blocking IL-1β."," Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: severity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of  function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is  supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions.  Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug  Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome  and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for  longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in  disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept  in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept  is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring  weekly rather than daily self-administration.

Here, we  specifically focus on tubulin acetylation from its discovery to recent studies  that provide new insights into how it is regulated in health and disease and how  it impacts microtubule functions. Even though new mechanisms involving tubulin  acetylation are regularly being uncovered, the molecular links between its location inside the microtubule lumen and its regulators and effectors is still  poorly understood. This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin  acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and  signalling. It also points out that tubulin acetylation should no longer be seen  as a passive marker of microtubule stability, but as a broad regulator of  microtubule functions.  ,  Context: and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments.

Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular  disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients. Left ventricular non-compaction diagnosis is often overlooked.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase θ in mammalian cells.," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase θ protects against genomic instability via an alternative  end-joining repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks. Polymerase θ is  overexpressed in breast, lung and oral cancers, and reduction of its activity in  mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,  including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the  C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase θ, illustrating two potential  modes of dimerization. One structure depicts insertion of ddATP opposite an  abasic-site analog during translesion DNA synthesis. The second structure  describes a cognate ddGTP complex. Polymerase θ uses a specialized thumb subdomain to establish unique upstream contacts to the primer DNA strand,  including an interaction with the 3'-terminal phosphate from one of five  distinctive insertion loops. These observations demonstrate how polymerase θ grasps the primer to bypass DNA lesions or extend poorly annealed DNA termini to  mediate end-joining.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. This repressive effect is"," Context: Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in  ","23809990, 24532715","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","19948482, 24462468, 22279046, 23809990, 24634216, 24879017, 24532715, 22850673, 22850674, 24685139, 24656819, 15342490",0.0,[1. 1.],[0. 1.],0.0

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is not directly involved in origin activation throughout the genome, but its deregulation leads to accumulation of DNA damage specifically in late replicating regions."," Context: histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation.  However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal  development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into  chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin  environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important  ","27131378, 23345616","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C In particular, the methylation states of H3K4, H3K36 and H4K20 have been associated with establishing active, repressed or poised origins depending on the timing and extent of methylation. 5BrC and 5ClC may cause aberrant methylation of cytosine during DNA replication and mimic the endogenous methylation signal associated with gene silencing.","23924899, 20735237, 27268234, 23345616, 27131378, 23754963, 24013172, 26598646, 24049080, 23152447",0.0,[1. 1.],[1. 1.],0.0
Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,ClC-Kb," Context: Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding  several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb,  Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR. We review the pathophysiology of these syndromes in relation to their clinical  presentation.  ,  Context: Bartter's syndrome belongs to a group of hypokalemic renal channel diseases.  These channels are located in the lipid layer of cell membranes where they exist  as water channels through which ion transport is performed. Based on the type of  genetic disorder and clinical presentation, Bartter's syndrome is classified as  neonatal, classical and Gitelman's syndrome. Most of the cases have been noted  in pediatric age groups and adult-onset cases are very rare. Moreover, an association between Bartter's syndrome and empty sella has recently been  reported in 3 children. We report here the second case of an adult patient  affected by Bartter's syndrome with partial empty sella. The patient showed some clinical and histological characteristics of both classic Bartter's syndrome and  Gitelman's syndrome, suggesting that genotype and phenotype of Bartter's  syndrome are not so clear-cut and that phenotypic overlap may occur, according  ","15056980, 16953151",Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB.,"9587066, 19050915, 15056980, 28555925",1.0,[1. 0.],[1. 1.],0.0
Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group. This suggests that RNA editing plays an adaptive role in cephalopods, rather than being a rare occurrence"," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: RNA editing is an alteration in the primary nucleotide sequences resulting from  a chemical change in the base. RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA,  transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). The most common RNA  editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where  the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I). Studies from ADAR  (adenosine deaminase that act on RNA) mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans,  Drosophila, and mice clearly show that the RNA editing process is an absolute  requirement for nervous system homeostasis and normal physiology of the animal.  Understanding the mechanisms of editing and findings of edited substrates has provided a better knowledge of the phenotype due to defective and hyperactive  RNA editing. A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of enzymes knows as  ADARs. ADARs modify duplex RNAs and editing of duplex RNAs formed by ncRNAs can impact RNA functions, leading to an altered regulatory gene network. Such  altered functions by A to I editing is observed in mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) but  other editing of small and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) has yet to be identified.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone (a type of TZD) are combined in a single pill called Avandamet.," Context: Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and  rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  represents an optimal approach to the treatment of diabetes.

U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation.

However, it is mentioned that GRPR analogs have been used as carriers to deliver drugs,"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)).

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ","7723058, 8411203","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by blocking radioiodine uptake by the thyroid.," Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years.

We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is demonstrated by the fact that EVs were purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK activity is linked to SG formation, as pharmacological kinase inhibition interferes with SG formation."," Context: expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.  ,  Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,PAPOLA/PAP is a poly(A) polymerase that interacts with Larp7 to maintain Lin28 mRNA stability.," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: not significantly increase P-TEFb activity. We further discover that Larp7  knockdown does not affect pluripotency but instead primes embryonic stem cells  (ESCs) for differentiation via downregulation of Lin28, a positive regulator of  organismal growth. Mechanistically, we show that Larp7 interacts with a poly(A)  polymerase Star-PAP to maintain Lin28 mRNA stability.

What is etarfolatide used for?,"Etarfolatide is used as a diagnostic tool to identify patients whose tumors express Folate Receptor alpha (FRα). Specifically, it is taken up by FR-positive tumors, allowing for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression"," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before  vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One  hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive  and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was  ,  Context: diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets  FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout  treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The  combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly stated in the provided text.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53. This function helps keep p53 levels in check in progenitor cells."," Context: The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of  adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA miR-29a was abundant in invasive breast cancer cells when compared to  non-tumourigenic cell types. When normal breast cells were treated with miR-29a,  HuR mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated. MiR-29a recognized a seed  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine  HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor  ","23401122, 19884656","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is specifically mentioned as a ""muscle-specific intermediate filament"", indicating it is only found in muscle cells, with no mention of its presence in plant cells."," Context: Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar  myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting. Desmin is the target of  posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation  and ubiquitylation as well as nonenzymatic modifications such as glycation,  oxidation and nitration. Several PTM target residues and their corresponding  modifying enzymes have been discovered in human and nonhuman desmin. The major  effect of phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation is the disassembly of desmin  filaments, while ubiquitylation of desmin leads to its degradation. The  regulation of the desmin filament network by phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological  processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle  atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  ,  Context: Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of  myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the  extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of  myofibrils. In contrast to prior expectations, we showed that some of the known  disease-causing mutations, such as DesA360P, DesQ389P and DesD399Y, are  assembly-competent and do allow formation of bona fide IFs in vitro and in vivo.  We also previously demonstrated that atomic force microscopy can be employed to  measure the tensile properties of single desmin IFs. Using the same approach on  filaments formed by the aforementioned mutant desmins, we now observed two different nanomechanical behaviors: DesA360P exhibited tensile properties  similar to that of wild-type desmin IFs, whereas DesQ389P and DesD399Y exhibited  local variations in their tensile properties along the filament length. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DesQ389P and DesD399Y may cause muscle  disease by altering the specific biophysical properties of the desmin filaments,  thereby compromising both its mechanosensing and mechanotransduction ability.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: AK141205 (Nanog-repressed), are direct targets of Oct4 and Nanog. Most  importantly, we demonstrate that these lncRNAs are not merely controlled by mESC  transcription factors, but that they themselves regulate developmental state:  knockdown and overexpression of these transcripts lead to robust changes in Oct4  and Nanog mRNA levels, in addition to alterations in cellular lineage-specific  gene expression and in the pluripotency of mESCs.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM.

CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful  for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package that has been developed for detecting hierarchical, biologically relevant topologically associated domains (TADs)."," Context: BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial  role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies  (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of  topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to  biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  ,  Context: studies of bHLH factor function in higher eukaryotes often have been hindered by  the presence of multiple family members. As a first step in developing a  simplified in vivo system to examine bHLH factor activities, we examined whether  the bHLH muscle regulatory factors MRF4 and MyoD function appropriately in  yeast. We show that Gal4-MRF4 fusion proteins, or native MRF4 proteins, activate  expression of an E-box HIS3 reporter gene whereas MyoD proteins remain inactive.  Deletion of the MRF4 transcription activation domain (TAD) or point mutations  that abolish MRF4 DNA interactions inhibit HIS3 expression. Substitution of the  MRF4 TAD with the Gal4 TAD also produces a functional protein, demonstrating that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in  yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates  an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family members. Using this experimental system, we also demonstrate that mammalian cDNA  libraries can be screened successfully for cDNAs encoding novel bHLH proteins  that interact with E-box targets.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is located on the X chromosome in humans.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold  increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class  switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B  lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation  endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands.

Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways and induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that it may inhibit tumor growth."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,Abiraterone acetate targets a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC by inhibiting androgen biosynthesis. It also has activity against AR and 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.," Context: hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting.

The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"No, there is no indication of thyronamines having an effect on fat tissue. The provided information only discusses the effects of thyronamines on glucose metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, and metabolic rate, but does not mention any impact on fat"," Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v.

The potential role for adipose tissue derived  cytokines and adipokines in the development of vascular disease and diabetes may  produce a clinical need to influence adipose tissue function. Various  pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions affect plasma cytokine and  adipokine levels. The effects of these interventions depend on weight loss per  se, changes in fat distribution without weight loss and/or direct effects on  adipose tissue inflammation.Weight loss, as a result of diet, pharmacology and surgery, positively influences plasma adipokines and systemic inflammation.  Several classes of drugs influence systemic inflammation directly through their  anti-inflammatory actions.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent.

Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,There is no national screening programme established for prostate cancer in the United Kingdom.," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers that never become clinically  significant, and the evidence of a subsequent reduction in mortality is  inconclusive. In addition to its role in screening, PSA is also used to monitor  the progression of the disease, both localized and metastatic. Although the  evidence is contradictory, PSA is still an important tool for monitoring patient  progression following treatment of definitive localized prostate cancer.  However, its use in monitoring castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is more  controversial, particularly in the context of novel targeted treatments, which  may have little impact on PSA levels. These issues highlight the urgent need to identify prostate cancer biomarkers that will improve early disease detection,  increase accuracy of diagnosis, determine the aggressiveness of disease, and  monitor treatment efficacy, particularly in late-stage disease.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context: CONTEXT: The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is  incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed  the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally  been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer  ,  Context: illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are  mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the  glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine  reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal  proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The  ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been  shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a  toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as  well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis,  blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in Caenorhabditis elegans.," Context: Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except  nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in  the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. It is unclear how operons have become  abundant in nematode genomes. The ""one-way street"" hypothesis asserts that once  formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage  would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C.  elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and  Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with  experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic  analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including  ,  Context: However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a critical role in mediating cardiac  contractility and its function is abnormal in the diabetic heart. However, the  mechanisms underlying SR dysfunction in the diabetic heart are not clear.  Because protein phosphorylation regulates SR function, this study examined the  phosphorylation state of phospholamban, a key SR protein that regulates SR  calcium (Ca2+) uptake in the heart. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley  rats by an injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg kg(-1) i.v.), and the animals  were humanely killed after 6 weeks and cardiac SR function was examined.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and high Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: events that occurred during evolution of the phylum Chordata, including two  rounds at about the origin of the subphylum Vertebrata (R1 and R2) and one round  before the teleost radiation (R3). Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such  genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"No, there is no indication in the provided text that colistin is an antibiotic. In fact, it is mentioned alongside chloramphenicol, which is explicitly stated to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but colistin's classification is not"," Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.
