What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that STAG3, a germinal cell-specific cohesin complex subunit, is involved in meiosis and sister chromatid cohesion"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  ,  Context: STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are  found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member,  STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.  ,  Context: alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues."," Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling. In this review, 14 multigene assays are evaluated as to  their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval  status, and estimated cost-benefit ratio. Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.  ,  Context:  Oncotype DX is an RT-PCR assay used to predict which patients with ER-positive  node-negative (NN) disease will benefit from chemotherapy. Each patient is  stratified into a risk category based on a recurrence score (RS) and the TAILORx trial is determining the benefit of chemotherapy for patients with mid-range  RSs. We tested if Oncotype DX and TAILORx risk categories could be predicted by  standard pathological features and protein markers corresponding to 10 genes in the assay (ER, PR, Ki67, HER2, BCL2, CD68, Aurora A kinase, survivin, cyclin B1  and BAG1) on 52 patients who enrolled on TAILORx.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD.

Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS)  ,  Context:  Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).

The toxicity  scores in T. nigroviridis tissues were much higher than in the respective  tissues of the other three fish species. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that the main toxic principle was tetrodotoxin  (TTX). This study is the first to report TTX in L. spadiceus.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies.

The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab.

These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context:  Epigenetic memory plays crucial roles in gene regulation. It not only modulates  the expression of specific genes but also has ripple effects on transcription as  well as translation of other genes. Very often an alteration in expression occurs either via methylation or demethylation. In this context, ""1-carbon  metabolism"" assumes a special significance since its dysregulation by higher  levels of homocysteine; Hcy (known as hyperhomocysteinemia; HHcy), a byproduct of ""1-Carbon Metabolism"" during methionine biosynthesis leads to serious  implications in cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular systems, and a host of  other conditions.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia, defined as an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma that usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It"," Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma  usually seen in 1-2% patients with severe coagulative disorder (James et al.,  2003). It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome that can affect nearly any organ system, with symptoms including fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as neurologic and dermatologic findings. It appears similar to cytokine storm syndrome and shows clinical features similar to Kawasaki disease,"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction.

Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"α-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1) is an enzyme that acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin. Additionally, MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyl"," Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ,  Context: invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context:  Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and Ivo­sidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  ,  Context: Somatic point mutations at a key arginine residue (R132) within the active site  of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) confer a novel gain of  function in cancer cells, resulting in the production of d-2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), an oncometabolite. Elevated 2-HG levels are implicated in epigenetic  alterations and impaired cellular differentiation. IDH1 mutations have been  described in an array of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we  report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant  enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to  effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. Preliminary data from phase 1 clinical trials enrolling patients with cancers harboring an IDH1  mutation indicate that AG-120 has an acceptable safety profile and clinical  activity.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a known immunosuppressive enzyme that  catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) to  kynurenine (Kyn), has received increasing attention as an attractive  immunotherapeutic target for cancer therapy.

We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C In particular, the methylation states of H3K4, H3K36 and H4K20 have been associated with establishing active, repressed or poised origins depending on the timing and extent of methylation. 5BrC and 5ClC may cause aberrant methylation of cytosine during DNA replication and mimic the endogenous methylation signal associated with gene silencing.","23924899, 20735237, 27268234, 23345616, 27131378, 23754963, 24013172, 26598646, 24049080, 23152447",,,,

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, particularly for pregnant and breast-feeding women, newborns, and children under 18 years, by reducing the risk of thyroid cancer."," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,There is no mention of PCDHGC4 or its relation to any condition in the provided context.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically AMPK-α2 isoform associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to  cellular stress. We also show that the RNA binding activity of the Rbfox family  protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the  role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to  identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a  subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of  Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1  mRNA and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure. Our  study proposes a novel function for Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules.  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is a related transcription factor and likely a paralog of UPC2 in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are laryngeal cancer cells from a cell line.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat prostate cancer (PCa), uterine fibroids (UF), and endometriosis-associated pain."," Context: AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy  menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Relugolix is a promising drug for the non-surgical treatment of women with UF. To date, the only published data come from a well-selected  Japanese female population study while results from worldwide ongoing studies  are ongoing in order to confirm the efficacy of this GnRH agonist receptor.  ,  Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2C9 is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market.," Context: radioactivity was close to complete after 13 days. Based on the metabolite  patterns, a phase II metabolite (M3) formed by glucuronidation of hydroxylated  siponimod was the main circulating metabolite in plasma. However, in subsequent  mouse ADME and clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a long-lived nonpolar  metabolite (M17, cholesterol ester of siponimod) was identified as the most  prominent systemic metabolite. We further conducted in vitro experiments to  investigate the enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of siponimod.  The selective inhibitor and recombinant enzyme results identified cytochrome  P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) as the predominant contributor to the human liver microsomal biotransformation of siponimod, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and other  cytochrome P450 enzymes.  ,  Context: monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeted against the p40 shared subunit of IL-12 and  IL-23.

In the present study the ability of IL-12 and IL-23 to suppress  multiple P450 enzymes was investigated in vitro using six separate lots of  cultured human hepatocytes. Following exposure of 10 ng/ml IL-12 and IL-23 for  48 hours, either alone or in combination, no change in CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 gene expression or functional activity was observed. None of the untreated  hepatocyte donors showed appreciable expression of the IL-12 or IL-23 receptors.  Similar results were seen with whole human liver samples. Exposure of hepatocytes to IL-12 and/or IL-23, known P450 suppressors (IL-6 and tumor  necrosis factor-α) or known P450 inducers (β-naphthoflavone, phenobarbital, and  rifampicin) did not appreciably alter the expression of the IL-12 and IL-23  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. Additionally, HuR function is implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype."," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context:  Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ","23223443, 19884656, 12730239, 23401122","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"According to recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization, the DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males.

We have  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2.

The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located.

Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in Caenorhabditis elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

Sphingolipid metabolites,  particularly ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), have recently received  attention for their potential roles in insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.  FTY720/fingolimod, a prodrug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is  phosphorylated in vivo to its active phosphorylated form by sphingosine kinase 2  and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide  biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P.

High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains.
