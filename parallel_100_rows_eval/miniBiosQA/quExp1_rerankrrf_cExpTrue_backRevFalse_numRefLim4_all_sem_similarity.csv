What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ,  Context: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic  mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma. We  examined the role of PCDH10 as a mediator of medulloblastoma cell proliferation,  cell cycle progression, and cell migration. METHODS: We identified a focal homozygous deletion of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma  by surveying a cohort of 212 tumours by Affymetrix SNP array analysis. PCDH10  expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in a series of  26 tumours. The promoter methylation status of PCDH10 was determined using  methylation specific PCR and Sequenom MassCLEAVE analysis. Functional studies examining the role of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma development were performed by  re-expression of PCDH10 in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, and then, cell  proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration assays were  performed. RESULTS: We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3  harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is  down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other  ,  Context: Protein methylation has an important role in the regulation of chromatin, gene  expression and regulation. The protein methyl transferases are genetically  altered in various human cancers. The enzymes that remove histone methylation  have led to increased awareness of protein interactions as potential drug  targets. Specifically, Lysine Specific Demethylases (LSD) removes methylated  histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through formaldehyde-generating oxidation. It has been reported that LSD1 and its  downstream targets are involved in tumor-cell growth and metastasis. Functional  studies of LSD1 indicate that it regulates activation and inhibition of gene transcription in the nucleus. Here we made a discussion about the summary of  histone lysine demethylase and their functions in various human cancers.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"There is no explicit mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation, suggesting a potential role in cell growth or division"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: organisms for the study of pollution) are not an exception to this lack of  knowledge. In the present work we first identified the existence of functionally  differentiated histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis (MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z), a marine organism widely used in  biomonitoring programs. Our results support the functional specialization of  these variants based on: a) their active expression in different tissues, as  revealed by the isolation of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in gonad and  hepatopancreas; b) the evolutionary conservation of different residues  encompassing functional relevance; and c) their ability to confer specialization to nucleosomes, as revealed by nucleosome reconstitution experiments using  recombinant MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z histones. Given the seminal role of these  variants in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, their preliminary characterization opens up new potential applications for the future  development of chromatin-based genotoxicity tests in pollution biomonitoring  programs.

METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave  increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following  latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be used to characterize diverse promoter architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide transcription start sites (TSSs), without relying on known promoter elements. It has been applied"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter  elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

RESULTS: The Fgenesh++ gene prediction pipeline can identify 91% of coding  nucleotides with a specificity of 90%. Our automatic pseudogene finder (PSF  program) found 90% of the manually annotated pseudogenes and some new ones. The  Fprom promoter prediction program identifies 80% of TATA promoters sequences  with one false positive prediction per 2,000 base-pairs (bp) and 50% of  TATA-less promoters with one false positive prediction per 650 bp. It can be  used to identify transcription start sites upstream of annotated coding parts of  genes found by gene prediction software. CONCLUSION: We review our software and underlying methods for identifying these  three important structural and functional genome components and discuss the  accuracy of predictions, recent advances and open problems in annotating genomic sequences. We have demonstrated that our methods can be effectively used for  initial automatic annotation of the eukaryotic genome.  ,  Context: The mechanisms underlying the human fetal-to-adult beta-globin gene switch  remain to be determined. While there is substantial experimental evidence to  suggest that promoter DNA methylation is involved in this process, most data  come from studies in nonhuman systems. We have evaluated human gamma- and  beta-globin promoter methylation in primary human fetal liver (FL) and adult  bone marrow (ABM) erythroid cells. Our results show that, in general, promoter methylation and gene expression are inversely related. However, CpGs at -162 of  the gamma promoter and -126 of the beta promoter are hypomethylated in ABM and  FL, respectively. We also studied gamma-globin promoter methylation during in vitro differentiation of erythroid cells. The gamma promoters are initially  hypermethylated in CD34(+) cells. The upstream gamma promoter CpGs become  hypomethylated during the preerythroid phase of differentiation and are then  ,  Context: with a focus on considerations for selecting therapy in type 1 disease. METHODS: Extracted and summarized applicable studies and reviews from Cochrane  Review, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, IPA, and PubMed.  RESULTS: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for the management of Gaucher  disease. Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over  another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a  lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative  treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however,  these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing  profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy  is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for  symptom management.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks obtained during initial surgery. Similarly, the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay also uses fixed paraffin"," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is  Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is  the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context: the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: according to the behavioral state, including the sleep-wake cycle. Several  components of the central autonomic networks are affected in neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions containing  α-synuclein. These include multiple system atrophy (MSA), characterized by  accumulation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and Lewy body disorders, including  Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and the so-called ""pure""  autonomic failure. In MSA, involvement of the rostral ventrolateral medulla may  be primarily responsible for orthostatic hypotension; involvement in the pontine  micturition area, sacral preganglionic nucleus, and Onuf nucleus is responsible for neurogenic bladder; and involvement of the pre-Bötzinger complex and  medullary raphe may contribute to sleep-related respiratory abnormalities. In  contrast, Lewy body disorders are characterized by early involvement of the enteric nervous system and cardiac sympathetic ganglia. The dorsal motor nucleus  of the vagus is affected both in MSA and at early stages of PD.  ,  Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD.

The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.

Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep is typically associated with a local reduction of genetic diversity around the adaptive site."," Context: hypersensitivity and scratching in response to noxious and pruritic stimuli. To  determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity may increase pain and itch behaviors  independent of secondary effects of tumor formation, we used mice with a  targeted, heterozygous Nf1 gene deletion (Nf1±) that lack tumors. Nf1± mice  exhibited normal baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Moreover,  similar to wild-type littermates, Nf1± mice developed inflammation-induced  heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior,  histamine-dependent or -independent scratching, and chronic constriction  injury-induced cold allodynia. However, Nf1± mice exhibited an attenuated first phase of formalin-induced spontaneous behavior and expedited resolution of  formalin-induced heat hypersensitivity. These results are not consistent with  the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity alone is sufficient to increase pain and itch sensation in mice, and they suggest that additional mechanisms may underlie  reports of increased pain and itch in NF1 patients. PERSPECTIVE: This study assessed whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increased  ,  Context: Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such  as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply  of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly  produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps  might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species.  ,  Context:  Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic  diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  ,  Context: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component  of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular  senescence. In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and  targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong  life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear. We  hypothesized that a rare loss-of-function mutation in SERPINE1 (c.699_700dupTA),  which encodes PAI-1, could play a role in longevity and metabolism in humans. We  studied 177 members of the Berne Amish community, which included 43 carriers of  the null SERPINE1 mutation. Heterozygosity was associated with significantly longer leukocyte telomere length, lower fasting insulin levels, and lower  prevalence of diabetes mellitus. In the extended Amish kindred, carriers of the  null SERPINE1 allele had a longer life span.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include LC3 and Atg12. Additionally, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins also contribute to autophagy."," Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays  ,  Context: Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a dynamic process for degradation of cytosolic  components. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions,  and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system  responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence  factors for blocking autophagy, whereas others utilize some autophagy components  for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  ,  Context:  Autophagy is a highly conserved process by which cells can recycle organelles  and proteins by degrading them in the lysosomes. Although autophagy is  considered a dynamic system responsible for cellular renovation and homeostasis under physiological conditions, it is increasingly clear that autophagy is  directly relevant to clinical disease. During disease progression, autophagy not  only serves as a cellular protective mechanism but also can represent a harmful event under certain conditions. In addition, although autophagy can act as a  nonselective bulk degradation process, recent research shows that autophagy can  selectively degrade specific proteins, organelles, and invading bacteria, in  ,  Context: Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (Pérez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms such as Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated"," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when  complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic  repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional output of their host genes, and potentially cause the functions of  protein-coding genes to be highly divergent across species.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene activation actually overrides physiologic programs and bypasses checkpoint mechanisms that are essential for genomic integrity, leading to relentless cellular proliferation and potentially causing genomic instability."," Context: and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the  repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context: apoptosis. Indeed, substantial evidence supports this hypothesis. Here, we  propose an alternative, although not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanation  for how oncogenes initiate and sustain tumorigenesis. We suggest that oncogene  activation initiates tumorigenesis precisely because it directly overrides  physiologic programs inducing a state of cellular amnesia, not only inducing  relentless cellular proliferation, but also bypassing checkpoint mechanisms that  are essential for cellular mortality, self-renewal, and genomic integrity.  Because no single oncogenic lesion is sufficient to overcome all of these  physiologic barriers, oncogenes are restrained from inducing tumorigenesis. Correspondingly, in a tumor that has acquired the complete complement of  oncogenic lesions required to overcome all of these safety mechanisms, the  inactivation of a single oncogene can restore some of these pathways resulting in proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis.  Thus, oncogenes induce cancer because they induce a cellular state of enforced  oncogenic amnesia in which, only upon oncogene inactivation, the tumor becomes  ,  Context:  Origin licensing builds a fundamental basis for genome stability in DNA  replication.

On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes.

We  review the evidence that implicates an imprinted gene in the INS-IGF2 region of  chromosome 11p15 in the etiology of IDDM (referred to as the IDDM2 locus) and  show that in human fetal pancreas, INS is not imprinted, thus providing an  argument against INS as the candidate gene. We also examine imprinting effects  on the expression of IGF2 in components of the human immune system believed to  be important in IDDM and show imprinted expression in fetal thymus as early as  15 weeks gestation. We demonstrate further that in the circulating mononuclear  cells of two individuals, lectin-stimulated IGF2 transcription was biallelic, indicating relaxation of imprinting, whereas in one individual, transcription  was monoallelic. Finally, we review the current available data supporting a role  for insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the immune system and, more specifically, discuss the evidence supporting a role for the IGFs in the  prevention of apoptosis. These data have led us to formulate a novel hypothesis  that could mechanistically explain the involvement of the IDDM2 locus in the  pathogenesis of IDDM.  ,  Context:  Imprinted genes are expressed in a monoallelic, parent-of-origin-specific  manner. Clusters of imprinted genes are regulated by imprinting control regions  (ICRs) characterized by DNA methylation of one allele. This methylation is critical for imprinting; a reduction in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 causes a  widespread loss of imprinting. To better understand the role of DNA methylation  in the regulation of imprinting, we characterized the effects of Dnmt1 mutations on the expression of a panel of imprinted genes in the embryo and placenta. We  found striking differences among imprinted domains. The Igf2 and Peg3 domains  showed imprinting perturbations with both null and partial loss-of-function  ,  Context: Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation. As transcription of IE genes does not require  prior viral protein synthesis, this class of genes is experimentally defined by  their transcription following primary infection or reactivation in the presence  of inhibitors of protein synthesis. This chapter describes an approach to  identify IE genes in a novel herpesvirus genome. Transcription of IE genes is selectively induced with sodium butyrate in the presence of the protein  synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The transcripts of the induced genes are  identified by using a cDNA subtraction-based method of gene expression  screening.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a progressive cystic swelling involving muscle produced by recurrent hemorrhage, accompanied by roentgenographic evidence of bone involvement. It is a rare complication in patients with hemophilia, occurring in 1-2%"," Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor has been defined as a progressive cystic swelling  involving muscle which is produced by recurrent hemorrhage and accompanied by  roentgenographic evidence of bone involvement. Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia, and, therefore, we present a case of a six-year-old  male hemophiliac with a cyst in the left distal radius.  ,  Context: A 46-year-old man with factor VIII deficiency presented with a rare case of  hemophilic pseudotumor in the temporal bone manifesting as severe conductive  hearing loss and external ear bleeding. The pseudotumor expanded and destroyed  the temporal bone and skin of the external ear over the course of 8 years. The  pseudotumor was surgically excised, and the patient's symptoms improved.  Histological examination of a specimen collected from inside the pseudotumor  demonstrated blood products in various stages of evolution and showed that the  outer membrane consisted of a collagen layer. Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare  complications occurring in 1-2% of patients with mild or severe hemophilia. Pseudotumors are chronic, slowly expanding, encapsulated cystic masses, and most  are located in the long bones and pelvis. The present case suggests that cranial  pseudotumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cranial lesion in a patient with hemophilia.  ,  Context: Pseudotumor is an uncommon but severe complication in patients with hemophilia.  To our knowledge, although China has large population of persons with  hemophilia, there is rare information on the incidence, clinical feature, image  finding, and management of pseudotumor among Chinese patients. This study aimed  at improving our knowledge on clinical diagnosis and management of hemophiliac  pseudotumor. In this retrospective study, the medical records of 1248 patients  with hemophilia diagnosed between January 1983 and October 2004 at our hospital  were reviewed. The clinical feature, imaging finding, management, and outcome of  14 patients with pseudotumor among these patients with hemophilia were analyzed. All patients have hemophilia A (8 severe cases and 6 moderate cases). Eight  patients sustained an injury prior to the development of pseudotumor. Main image  findings included osteolysis lesion, soft tissue swelling, or lump. Surgical therapy was carried out in 7 patients and 6 achieved remission, with fistula  formation remaining in 1. One patient underwent radiotherapy together with  replacement therapy achieved remission. Three patients accepted replacement  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Hemophilic pseudotumor (HP) is a rare complication in patients with  hemophilia. The lesion most frequently occurs in the long bones, pelvis, small  bones of the hands and feet, or rarely in the maxillofacial region. Postoperative changes in HP are seldom arrested, whereas angiogenesis  characterized by disturbed wound healing in HP may cause vascular malformations.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus and severe corneal scarring due to a firework explosion 45 years ago are managed by the Athens Protocol.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

Primary LHON  mutations may rarely manifest without ocular compromise but with arterial  hypertension, various neurodegenerative diseases, or Leigh syndrome. Patients  with LHON need to be closely followed up to detect at which point organs other  than the eyes become affected. Multiorgan disease in LHON often responds more  favorably to symptomatic treatment than the ocular compromise.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To investigate refractive, topometric, pachymetric, and visual  rehabilitation changes induced by anterior surface normalization for keratoconus  by partial topography-guided excimer laser ablation in conjunction with  accelerated, high-fluence cross-linking.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. Additionally, mTORC1 regulates STAT3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of"," Context: incompletely understood. We investigated whether activation of AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK) prevents the hepatic insulin resistance that is induced by  the consumption of a high-protein diet (HPD) and the presence of excess amino  acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK  phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the  insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor  substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either  ,  Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling  critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ","24302004, 26026060, 23641065, 24931163","mTORC1 was found to regulate STAT3 activity in, at least, three ways: 1) after induction by IL6, 2) by direct phosphorylation during hypoxia, to promote HIF-1α mRNA transcription, and 3) after activation by excess amino acids, which then positively regulate Notch1 expression through STAT3 activation.","22055460, 23641065, 26026060, 24302004, 24931163",0.861,[0.439 0.663 0.75  0.575],[0.493 0.676 0.712 0.734],0.786
List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with  iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA  ,  Context: reviewed the medical records of 36 patients (24 women and 12 men) with elements  of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The complete triad was present in 9 (25%)  patients. Orofacial involvement was the dominant feature; it occurred in all 36  patients and was the presenting sign in 15 (42%). Lingua plicata occurred in 18  (50%) patients, and peripheral facial paralysis was present in 17 (47%).  Fourteen biopsy specimens were obtained, all from the orofacial region. Eight  specimens revealed the classic pathologic picture of granulomatous cheilitis. No  etiologic agent was identified in any of the patients. Diagnosis is difficult  when all features of the triad are not present. A conservative treatment approach is recommended.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads revealed that mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages"," Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation.  ,  Context: strategy to catch fish. This unique feeding behaviour requires secretion of  ""nirvana cabal"" peptides to dampen the escape response of targeted fish allowing  for their capture directly by mouth. However, the active components of the  nirvana cabal remain poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural  effects of likely nirvana cabal peptides on the teleost model, Danio rerio  (zebrafish). Surprisingly, the conantokins (NMDA receptor antagonists) and/or  conopressins (vasopressin receptor agonists and antagonists) found in C.  geographus and C. tulipa venom failed to produce a nirvana cabal-like effect in  zebrafish. In contrast, low concentrations of the non-competitive adrenoceptor antagonist ρ-TIA found in C. tulipa venom (EC50 = 190 nM) dramatically reduced  the escape response of zebrafish larvae when added directly to aquarium water.  ρ-TIA inhibited the zebrafish α1-adrenoceptor, confirming ρ-TIA has the potential to reverse the known stimulating effects of norepinephrine on fish  behaviour. ρ-TIA may act alone and not as part of a cabal, since it did not  synergise with conopressins and/or conantokins. This study highlights the  ,  Context: sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently  identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of  the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a  uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations  lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread  cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into  ,  Context: Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at  their 3' ends. Here we show that polyadenylated 3' termini in three yeast  species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Debaryomyces  hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs  ","19032167, 31780714, 22722342, 23776204",Yes.

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,"PMP22 gene has been found mutated in CMT1A. Specifically, the T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A (CMT1A)."," Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy signified by a distal symmetric  polyneuropathy.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,Avapritinib selectively inhibits oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants by targeting the active conformation of the kinase.," Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: therapies (n = 103) was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-25). Median  duration of response was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.2-10.2), and median  progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.8-4.6).  CONCLUSION: Avapritinib has manageable toxicity with meaningful clinical  activity as fourth-line or later treatment in some patients with GIST with KIT  or PDGFRA mutations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the NAVIGATOR trial, avapritinib, an inhibitor of  KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A tyrosine kinases, provided  durable responses in a proportion of patients with advanced gastrointestinal  stromal tumors (GIST) who had received three or more prior therapies. Avapritinib had a tolerable safety profile, with cognitive adverse events  manageable with dose interruptions and modification in most cases. These  findings indicate that avapritinib can elicit durable treatment responses in some patients with heavily pretreated GIST, for whom limited treatment options  exist.

Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly stable forms of non-coding RNAs with diverse  biological functions. They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast  cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified.

However, a precise function and  working mechanism are lacking for the larger majority. Following many different experimental and computational approaches to identify circRNAs, multiple circRNA  databases were developed as well. Unfortunately, there are several major issues  with the current circRNA databases, which substantially hamper progression in the field.

It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases.

The cause and natural history of the pigmentation have not been clarified, although it is associated with a variety  of systemic illnesses and medications. With electron microscopy and  electron-probe energy dispersive X-ray analysis, the pigment corresponds principally to an accumulation of ferrous sulfide (FeS) in macrophages within  the lamina propria.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood  vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis.  ,  Context: The emergence of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented an  unprecedented global challenge.

Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use. Overall, there was no evidence of  ,  Context: long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and  ,  Context: Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy™) is an orally administered, small molecule,  highly-selective, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that was  developed by Allergan under license to Merck & Co. as an acute treatment for  migraine. In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"Filoviruses, specifically Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%."," Context:  The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context: Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with  mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%. Despite numerous efforts to  identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between  the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an  increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology. The high mortality  rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has  propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat. This  article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic  potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment of future outbreaks, which would help prevent the evolution of filovirus into  more virulent and more transmissible viruses.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context: Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, for which infestations can rapidly lead to  colony death. Tropilaelaps is hence considered more dangerous to A. mellifera  than the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Honey bees are also infected by many  different viruses, some of them associated with and vectored by V. destructor.  In recent years, deformed wing virus (DWV) has become the most prevalent virus  infection in honey bees associated with V. destructor. DWV is distributed  world-wide, and found wherever the Varroa mite is found, although low levels of  the virus can also be found in Varroa free colonies. The Varroa mite transmits  viral particles when feeding on the haemolymph of pupae or adult bees. Both the Tropilaelaps mite and the Varroa mite feed on honey bee brood, but no  observations of DWV in Tropilaelaps have so far been reported. In this study,  quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to show the presence of DWV in infested brood and Tropilaelaps mercedesae mites collected in China, and to demonstrate a  close quantitative association between mite-infested pupae of A. mellifera and  DWV infections.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine receptors.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ","33200890, 33229362, 32324502, 32562029",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are MEC-17 (acetyltransferase), SIRT2 (deacetylase), and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase)."," Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context: Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in  MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules.  Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of  HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in  the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that  the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to  microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased  binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule  stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule  dynamics under certain conditions.  ,  Context: Angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cell migration, which was  blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. It has been reported  that angiotensin II is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by  mechanical stretch in endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that endothelial  cells subjected to a 10% uniaxial stretch showed vertical alignment to the  direction of tension and tubulin deacetylation in the peripheral side of cells,  in comparison with control static cells. The mechanical stretch-induced changes  of microtubules were blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion.  Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that acetylated tubulin was decreased in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in the intima of  the aortic walls in mice loaded with angiotensin II, in comparison with mice  loaded with control vehicle. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in  endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced  vascular remodeling.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have potential for antitumor activity, but they also have immunosuppressive properties that support cancer growth. Targeting TAMs as an oncological therapy is being explored, with strategies aiming to reprogram them to enhance antitumor"," Context: still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting  strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context:  Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the  growth of, the cancer cells. Molecularly targeted therapy is the modern  expression of this paradigm. Increasingly, however, the realization that the cancer has co-opted the normal cells of the stroma for its own survival has led  to the concept that the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be targeted for  effective therapy. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer  ,  Context: received the complement blocker eculizumab in addition to the interferon gamma  blocker emapalumab had complete resolution of their TMA and survived. Our  observations suggest co-activation of both interferon and complement pathways as  a potential culprit in the evolution of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients  with inflammatory disorders like refractory HLH and may offer novel therapeutic  approaches for these critically ill patients. TMA should be considered in  children with HLH and multi-organ failure, as an early institution of a brief  course of complement blocking therapy in addition to HLH-targeted therapy may  improve clinical outcomes in these patients.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is crucial for hematopoiesis as it regulates erythroblast expansion and proliferation in an erythropoietin-independent manner. Its expression is highly restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts"," Context: In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1  and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an erythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote  erythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts.  Erythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate  ,  Context: GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation  of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change  characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and  Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role  of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to  the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility is measured through the NOMe-seq methodology.," Context: combinatorial modification pattern as well as differentiation-related changes of  single modifications. We demonstrate that our method is capable of reproducing  recent findings of gene centered approaches, e.g. correlations between  CpG-density and the analyzed histone modifications. Moreover, combining the  clustered epigenetic data with information on the expression status of  associated genes we classify differences in epigenetic status of e.g.  house-keeping genes versus differentiation-related genes. Visualizing the  distribution of modification states on the chromosomes, we discover strong  patterns for chromosome X. For example, exclusively H3K9me3 marked segments are enriched, while poised and active states are rare. Hence, our method also  provides new insights into chromosome-specific epigenetic patterns, opening up  new questions how ""epigenetic computation"" is distributed over the genome in  space and time.  ,  Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with an increased risk of breast cancer.

RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained.

Among these, 166 men with a prostate specific antigen  (PSA) level ≥ 3 ng/mL or abnormal digit rectal examination (DRE) prospectively  underwent prostate biopsies. The relationship between digit ratio and prostate  cancer detection rate and biopsy findings was investigated.  RESULTS: The study subjects were allocated to two groups by digit ratio (group  A: digit ratio < 0.95; n = 420; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95; n = 350). Despite  similar biopsy rates (22.4% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.544), group A had higher cancer detection rate (46.8% (44/94) vs. 23.6% (17/72), p = 0.002; OR = 2.847, 95% CI =  1.445-5.610). When we analyzed 408 positive biopsy cores (group A: digit ratio <  0.95, n = 282; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95, n = 126), group A had higher percentage of core cancer volume (46.7% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.005) and more biopsy  cores with high Gleason score (sum of Gleason score ≥ 9: 18/282 (6.4%) vs. 1/126  (0.8%), p = 0.010; primary Gleason score = 5: 12/282 (4.3%) vs. 0/126 (0.0%), p  = 0.021).

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?",Mutations in the Cypher gene have been identified in patients with both isolated non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).," Context:  Cardiac involvement is frequent in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with dilated  cardiomyopathy and severe arrhythmias having been reported. Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients. Left ventricular non-compaction diagnosis is  ,  Context: end-diastolic diameter was 66 ± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 ±  10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved  in all the cases. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 40%o. The average  follow-up was 19 months and no patient died during this period. Sixty seven  percent of the patients had manifestations of heart failure, 27%o presented  sustained ventricular arrhythmias and 20%> had atrial fibrillation or flutter,  whereas 13%o had cerebral embolic events. An automated internal cardioverter  defibrillator was implanted in 47%o of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Non-compaction cardiomyopathy is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity. The diagnosis is made in advanced stages of the  disease, with significant dilation and ventricular dysfunction.  ,  Context:  Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare congenital  cardiomyopathy that affects both children and adults. Since the clinical  manifestations are not sufficient to establish diagnosis, echocardiography is the diagnostic tool that makes it possible to document ventricular  non-compaction and establish prognostic factors. We report a 47-year-old woman  with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with unknown etiology.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by establishing mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early S-phase. It tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes, thereby controlling the"," Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: ATM/53BP1 to inhibit the 5'-3' end resection of broken DNA ends, in-turn  facilitating NHEJ repair and inhibiting homology directed repair. Rif1 is  conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length  regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells.  Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to  include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S  phase checkpoint. We present a summary of these important findings highlighting  the various aspects of Rif1 functions and discuss the key implications for  genomic integrity.

Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism.

We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the  function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context: Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences challenge the replication, transcription,  and translation machinery by spontaneously folding into G-quadruplexes, the  unfolding of which requires forces greater than most polymerases can exert1,2.  Eukaryotic cells contain numerous helicases that can unfold G-quadruplexes 3 .  The molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of G-quadruplexes by  helicases remains poorly understood.

Which data simulator is available for CLIP-SEQ experiments?,"Cseq-Simulator is a simulator specifically designed for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP, and iCLIP-data, which can be used to generate realistic datasets as surrogates for experimental gold standard datasets in CLIP-Seq experiments"," Context: developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of  RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the  available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is  because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed  and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard  dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and  iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that  can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we  also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak  calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are  measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is  particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the  design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and  whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs  abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can  also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome.

With increasing variety and sequencing depth of HTS datasets, the need for more flexible and  memory-efficient tools to analyse them is growing. RESULTS: We describe Pyicos, a powerful toolkit for the analysis of mapped reads from diverse HTS experiments: ChIP-Seq, either punctuated or broad signals,  CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. We prove the effectiveness of Pyicos to select for  significant signals and show that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes  ,  Context: Data analysis in proteomics is complex and with the extra challenges involved in  the interpretation of data from N-terminomics experiments, this can be  daunting.Therefore, we have devised a rational pipeline of steps to approach  N-terminomics data analysis in a statistically based and valid manner. We have  automated these steps in CLIPPER, an add-on to the Trans-Proteomic  Pipeline(TPP). Applying CLIPPER to the analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high  confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization  and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It also participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in  Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata.  The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins. Based on these data, a model for Groucho/Tle gene evolution is proposed.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing depends on its subdivision  into anterior and posterior compartments, which constitute two independent cell  lineages since their origin in the embryonic ectoderm. The anterior-posterior compartment boundary is the place where signaling by the Hedgehog pathway takes  place, and this requires pathway activation in anterior cells by ligand  expressed exclusively in posterior cells. Several mechanisms ensure the confinement of hedgehog expression to posterior cells, including repression by  Cubitus interruptus, the co-repressor Groucho and Master of thick veins.

Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This  review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.  ,  Context: hypertension and proteinuria, in patients with CKD, and (3) reduce interdialytic  weight gain and intradialytic hypotension in ESRD. Here, we report the effects  of tenapanor on dietary phosphorous absorption. Oral administration of tenapanor  or other intestinal sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 inhibitors increased fecal  phosphorus, decreased urine phosphorus excretion, and reduced  [(33)P]orthophosphate uptake in rats. In a rat model of CKD and vascular  calcification, tenapanor reduced sodium and phosphorus absorption and  significantly decreased ectopic calcification, serum creatinine and serum  phosphorus levels, circulating phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 levels, and heart mass. These results indicate that tenapanor is an effective  inhibitor of dietary phosphorus absorption and suggest a new approach to  phosphate management in renal disease and associated mineral disorders.  ,  Context: literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"Yes, H4K20 methylation is associated with DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by PR-Set7, and its depletion results in defective S phase progression and accumulation"," Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context:  The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  ,  Context: cycle exit with quiescence is unclear. We find that primary human fibroblasts  induced into quiescence exhibit tighter chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry  analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in  quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in  proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases  shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and  H4K20me3 in quiescence. Knockdown of the enzyme that creates H4K20me3 results in  an increased fraction of cells in S phase, a defect in exiting the cell cycle,  and decreased chromatin compaction. Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for  H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in  its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells.  ,  Context:  Nucleosome dynamics facilitated by histone turnover is required for  transcription as well as DNA replication and repair. Histone turnover is often  associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). In  order to correlate histone modifications and transcription-dependent histone  turnover, we performed genome wide analyses for euchromatic regions in G2/M-arrested fission yeast. The results show that transcription-dependent  histone turnover at 5' promoter and 3' termination regions is directly  correlated with the occurrence of H3K56Ac and H4K20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1)  ","19571682, 27131378, 23924899, 27268234","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB gene.," Context: 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context:  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb, Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR. We review  ,  Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome  and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport  channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent reports suggest that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis.  Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet represents an optimal approach to the treatment of diabetes. This manuscript  reviews the pharmacology, safety and benefits of the combination pill Avandamet.  ,  Context: Insulin resistance is a major endocrinopathy underlying the development of  hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Metformin (a  biguanide) and rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) counter insulin resistance,  acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  ,  Context: Rosiglitazone is a potent oral antidiabetic agent of the thiazolidinedione class  that works through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear  receptor. It improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and effectively  lowers blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin is a  dimethyl-biguanide, also used in type 2 diabetes, that lowers fasting blood  glucose primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose output. Rosiglitazone and metformin reduce plasma glucose concentrations via different mechanisms and thus  could potentially be used in combination to optimize glycemic control. This  study evaluated the effects of the coadministration of these two agents on the pharmacokinetics of both rosiglitazone and metformin. Sixteen male volunteers  (22-55 years old) received oral metformin (500 mg every 12 hours), rosiglitazone  (2 mg every 12 hours), or the combination each for 4 days.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by designing bifunctional oligonucleotides called U1 Adaptors that have a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain," Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory  elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.  We propose ExSpeU1s as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct, in several human disorders, different types of splicing mutations associated with defective exon  definition.  ,  Context: nuclear bodies including Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs). GEMs contribute to the  biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA), a component of splicing  machinery. The number of GEMs and a subset of U snRNAs decrease in spinal  muscular atrophy, a lower motor neuron disease, suggesting that alteration of U  snRNAs may also underlie the molecular pathogenesis of ALS. Here, we  investigated the number of GEMs and U11/12-type small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  (snRNP) by immunohistochemistry and the level of U snRNAs using real-time  quantitative RT-PCR in ALS tissues. GEMs decreased in both TDP-43-depleted HeLa  cells and spinal motor neurons in ALS patients. Levels of several U snRNAs decreased in TDP-43-depleted SH-SY5Y and U87-MG cells. The level of U12 snRNA  was decreased in tissues affected by ALS (spinal cord, motor cortex and  thalamus) but not in tissues unaffected by ALS (cerebellum, kidney and muscle). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the decrease in U11/12-type snRNP in  spinal motor neurons of ALS patients. These findings suggest that loss of TDP-43  function decreases the number of GEMs, which is followed by a disturbance of  ","22454067, 19219028, 22362925, 23740936","Until now, two main types of therapeutic strategies have been developed using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA): 1) Production of a defective, but partially functional protein, with the help of exon skipping, through modulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and 2) Correction of pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations with the use of U1 snRNA adapted to the defective variant.","22968481, 21326217, 20869034, 22362925, 21520335, 22454066, 22454067, 19219028",0.799,[0.66  0.669 0.468 0.556],[0.668 0.735 0.517 0.527],0.875
When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: conventional treatments are often ineffective in reducing TG under the threshold  to prevent acute pancreatitis (AP). The inhibition of APOC3, which encodes a  protein involved in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) removal, has  been reported to be a novel target for the treatment of sHTG. Volanesorsen is a  second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibiting apoC-III  transcription/translation that has been recently approved in Europe for Familial  Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the evidences on the efficacy and safety  of volanesorsen for the treatment of sHTG syndromes. EXPERT OPINION: Volanesorsen effectively reduces TG in sHTG through a mechanism that is mainly LPL-independent, potentially decreasing the risk of AP. Some  safety concerns have been raised with the use of volanesorsen, mainly  represented by the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Due to the potential severity of side effects, some caution is needed before affirming the long-term utility  of this drug. Despite this, volanesorsen currently remains the only drug that  has been demonstrated effective in FCS, which otherwise remains an untreatable  disease.  ,  Context: Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class  treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats,  monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This  also included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species  excreted in urine. Volanesorsen is highly bound to plasma proteins that are similar in mice, monkeys, and humans. In all species, plasma concentrations  declined in a multiphasic fashion, characterized by a relatively fast initial  distribution phase and then a much slower terminal elimination phase following subcutaneous bolus administration. The plasma metabolite profiles of  volanesorsen are similar across species, with volanesorsen as the major  component. Various shortened oligonucleotide metabolites (5-19 nucleotides long)  ,  Context: risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased  risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14), and neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) mRNA was detected in all 14 of the NSCLC"," Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.  Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: Rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v [from an A-T or T-A  nucleotide pair (AT-pair) to a G-C or C-G nucleotide pair (GC-pair)] and u [from  a GC-pair to an AT-pair], are usually not the same. The net effect, v/(u + v),  has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the  mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field of molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution,  symmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation  frequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.

Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life.

The  critical organ for iodine is the thyroid. A number of studies dealing with  thyroid protection from exposure to radioiodine have shown that radioiodine  uptake by the thyroid can be effectively blocked by administration of stable  iodine, usually in the form of potassium iodide (KI) pills. However, unless  perfectly timed, this protective action may be counterproductive. The  International Atomic Energy Agency recommends potassium iodide prophylaxis in  cases when an avertable thyroid dose by protective action exceeds 100 mGy. This paper reviews experiences and practices with potassium iodide in the thyroid  protection. This kind of information should serve as the basis for discussion  and decision making on KI prophylactic programmes in nuclear emergency situations in Croatia. If Croatia adopts such programme, it will still have to  develop the most effective way of KI stockpiling and distribution or  predistribution.  ,  Context:  The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued.

Here we  describe different common methods to measure senescence in cell cultures and in  tissues. These include measurement of senescence-associated β-galactosidase  activity (SA-β-gal), senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs),  proliferative arrest, morphological changes, and expression and activity of  proteins involved in the senescence process, such as p53 and Rb pathway proteins  and secretory proteins. It is important to note that there is no unique marker  that unambiguously defines a senescent state, and it is therefore necessary to combine measurements of several different markers that together determine  whether cells are senescent or not. Measurement of senescence is an important  aspect of studies of MYC biology and will improve our understanding of MYC function and regulation both in preclinical and clinical settings. This may form  the basis for new concepts of pro-senescence therapy to combat MYC in cancer.  ,  Context: report our further benchmarking of the new version of ProteinGoggle with  publically available photon-based dissociation (UVPD) data  (http://hdl.handle.net/2022/17316) of intact E. coli ribosomal proteins.

Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL).

High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: both cancer syndromes. Interestingly, three of the double mutants had a young  age of onset or severe breast cancer phenotype and carried mutations in moderate  to low-risk DNA damage repair-associated genes; two of them presented biallelic  inactivation of CHEK2. We included these two patients for the sake of their  clinical interest although we are aware that they do not exactly fulfil the  definition of MINAS since both mutations are in the same gene.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic analysis of a broad cancer gene panel  identified the largest series of patients with MINAS described in a single  study. Overall, our data do not support the existence of more severe manifestations in double mutants at the time of diagnosis although they do  confirm previous evidence of severe phenotype in biallelic CHEK2 and other DNA  repair cancer-predisposing genes.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP-Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: structural and functional relationships remain unknown. Here, we report that  affinity-purified ARC consists of two distinct multisubunit complexes: a larger  complex, denoted ARC-L, and a smaller coactivator, CRSP. Reconstituted in vitro  transcription with biochemically separated ARC-L and CRSP reveals differential  cofactor functions. The ARC-L complex is transcriptionally inactive, whereas the  CRSP complex is highly active. Structural determination by electron microscopy  (EM) and three-dimensional reconstruction indicate substantial differences in  size and shape between ARC-L and CRSP. Moreover, EM analysis of independently  derived CRSP complexes reveals distinct conformations induced by different activators. These results suggest that CRSP may potentiate transcription via  specific activator-induced conformational changes.  ,  Context: coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of  RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and  functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator  complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex  failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference  between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence.  Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals  a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP  or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16 activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator  functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA  Pol II via the CTD.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is evident from the fact that EVs were purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context: Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on  the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC  strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external  medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme.  Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional  electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two  major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is  secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in  Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC. These  observations indicate that exported GAPDH may act as a virulence factor which  could contribute to EHEC and EPEC pathogenesis. This is the first description of an extracellular localization for this enzyme, with a function other than its  glycolytic role in Gram-negative pathogens.  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context: RPMI-enriched medium. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) level was determined by  ELISA after 24 h of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The antibacterial activity  of OLE was determined by well diffusion assay. We found a significant decrease  in TNFα secretion level in PMNCs culture treated with OLE. Oleuropein is the  only OLE component that has shown anti-inflammatory effects at a concentration  of 20 μg/mL. Furthermore, OLE exhibited antibacterial activity against some gram  positive bacterial strains; however, gram negative bacterial strains were  resistant to OLE. Downregulation of TNFα secretion in PMNCs culture in response  to OLE treatment indicates that this polyphenol-rich extract has an anti-inflammatory effect, and oleuropein is the major OLE component responsible  for this effect. The antibacterial activity of OLE is limited to gram positive  bacteria.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK activity is linked to SG formation, as pharmacological kinase inhibition interferes with SG formation, and AMPK-α knockdown leads to changes in SG"," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: During cell stress, the transcription and translation of immediate early genes  are prioritized, while most other messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are stored away in  stress granules or degraded in processing bodies (P-bodies). TIA-1 is an  mRNA-binding protein that needs to translocate from the nucleus to seed the  formation of stress granules in the cytoplasm. Because other stress granule  components such as TDP-43, FUS, ATXN2,SMN, MAPT, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPA1 are  crucial for the motor neuron diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/spinal  muscular atrophy (SMA) and for the frontotemporal dementia(FTD), here we studied  mouse nervous tissue to identify mRNAs with selective dependence on Tia1 deletion. Transcriptome profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays in comparison  of spinal cord and cerebellum, together with independent validation in  quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots demonstrated several strong and consistent dysregulations. In agreement with previously reported TIA1  knock down effects, cell cycle and apoptosis regulators were affected markedly  with expression changes up to +2-fold, exhibiting increased levels for Cdkn1a,  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal  transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular  antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by  TPEN. In addition, Zn2+ is released in cells treated with arsenite, before  stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological ligand of TIA-1, acting as a stress-inducible second messenger to promote  multimerization of TIA-1 and subsequent localization into stress granules.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP regulates poly(A) tail length by deadenylation, which in turn controls mRNA stability and translation initiation."," Context: the associated Type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that synthesizes  PI4,5P2 as well as protein kinases. These associated kinases act as coactivators  of Star-PAP that regulates its activity and specificity toward mRNAs, yet the  mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a  phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the  domain required for PIPKIα interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by  CKIα within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and  interaction with PIPKIα. Unlike the CKIα mediated phosphorylation at the  catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKIα activity. S6 phosphorylation  together with coactivator PIPKIα controlled select subset of Star-PAP target  messages by regulating Star-PAP-mRNA association. Our results establish a novel role for phosphorylation in determining Star-PAP target mRNA specificity and  regulation of 3'-end processing.  ,  Context: Air1/2 ZnK4 and -5 are critical for Trf4 interaction and that the Air1-Trf4  interaction and Air1 level are critical for TRAMP complex integrity. We identify  a conserved IWRXY motif in the Air1 ZnK4-5 linker that is important for Trf4  interaction. We also find that hZCCHC7, a putative human orthologue of Air1 that  contains the IWRXY motif, localizes to the nucleolus in human cells and  interacts with both mammalian Trf4 orthologues, PAPD5 and PAPD7 (PAP-associated  domain containing 5 and 7), suggesting that hZCCHC7 is the Air component of a  human TRAMP complex.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: In testis mRNA stability and translation initiation are extensively under the  control of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP). Here we have cloned a new human  testis-specific PABP (PABP3) of 631 amino acids (70.1 kDa) with 92.5% identical  residues to the ubiquitous PABP1. A northern blot of multiple human tissues  hybridised with PABP3- and PABP1-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed two  PABP3 mRNAs (2.1 and 2.5 kb) detected only in testis, whereas PABP1 mRNA (3.2  kb) was present in all tested tissues. In human adult testis, PABP3 mRNA  expression was restricted to round spermatids, whereas PABP1 was expressed in  these cells as well as in pachytene spermatocytes. PABP3-specific antibodies identified a protein of 70 kDa in human testis extracts. This protein binds  poly(A) with a slightly lower affinity as compared to PABP1. The human PABP3  gene is intronless with a transcription start site 61 nt upstream from the initiation codon. A sequence of 256 bp upstream from the transcription start  site drives the promoter activity of PABP3 and its tissue-specific expression.

It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments.

It allows for whole-body monitoring of FRα," Context: FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before  vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed  for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One  hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive  and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was observed in 56.4% of FR-positive lesions versus 20.7% of FR-negative lesions (P  < 0.001). Patient DCR was 57%, 36%, and 33% in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%)  patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 14.6, 9.6, and 3.0 months in  ,  Context: frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets  FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting  ,  Context: Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is the most common survivable disorder due to  aneuploidy.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: High-grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common malignant brain tumors in the  pediatric population and account for a large subset of all pediatric central  nervous system neoplasms. The management of pediatric HGG continues to be  challenging, with poor outcome in many cases despite aggressive treatments.  Consequently, parallel research efforts have been focused on identifying the  underlying genetic and biological basis of pediatric HGG in order to more  clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification as well as  identify new treatment targets. These cutting-edge advances have revolutionized  pediatric neuro-oncology and have revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Promising treatments - including  pathway-targeting small molecules as well as epigenetic therapy - are being  evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in rare glioma subgroups have led to the identification of additional new  potentially-actionable alterations. This review summarizes the current state of  knowledge about the molecular characterization of pediatric HGG in correlation  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context: Head computed tomography (CT) is instrumental for managing patients of all ages.  However, its low dose radiation may pose a low but non-zero risk of tumor  induction in pediatric patients. Here, we present a systematic literature review  on the estimated incidence of brain tumor induction from head CT exams performed  on children and adolescents. MEDLINE was searched using an electronic protocol  and bibliographic searches to identify articles related to CT, cancer, and  epidemiology or risk assessment.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa (Brineura) is approved for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a pediatric neurodegenerative disease. Specifically, it is approved for the treatment"," Context:  Cerliponase alfa (Brineura™) is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase-1  (TPP1) being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. for use in patients with  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a paediatric neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections.

Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies  included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme  replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher  disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in  people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two  years.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues, including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart tissue, and cartilaginous structures."," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is  driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing,  art, education and medicine. Recent advances have enabled 3D printing of  biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures. Other applications include developing  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context:  The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the  C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group P3(2) with unit-cell parameters a = 67.2, b = 67.2, c = 257.5 Å. The Matthews  coefficient was determined to be 3.41 Å(3) Da(-1) with two molecules in the  asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by the single-anomalous  ,  Context: duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The  combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the  major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus  yeast sterol.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: and its metabolites are scarce and do not allow characterization of its  genotoxic potential and define the risk assessment.The human larynx epidermoid  carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) has been shown to be sensitive to the toxic effects  of xenobiotics of different origin and have been often used in citotoxicity and  genotoxicity studies. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the induction of  genotoxicity and the role of oxidative stress in HEp-2cell line by exposure to  the IP. The MTT test for viability resulted in CL50 85.86 (77.05-95.68) μg/mL of  Iprodione. On the basis of this result, we proceeded to expose the cells to the  sublethal concentrations (below the CL50) during 24 h to analyze the mitotic index and nuclear division index in order to determine the subcytotoxic  concentrations of IP which the genotoxicity was evaluated. The subcytotoxic  concentrations of 7, 17, and 25 μg/mL IP induced aneugenic effects as micronuclei centromere positive whereas 17 μg/mL was a threshold for centromere  negative micronuclei induction in HEp-2 cells. The abnormal mitosis was induced  for exposition of Hep-2 cells to the three concentrations. According to the  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ","25658113, 24477342, 30702281, 11093143",human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2),"32409089, 30702281, 32384969, 25658113",0.826,[0.421 0.272 0.274 0.304],[0.668 0.605 0.443 0.274],0.613
Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Epistaxis is a minor complication associated with dental implant placement, specifically when an intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane is made during the procedure."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: The objective of this study is to describe the initial use of propranolol as the  sole treatment for focal infantile airway hemangiomas, and to report on  available literature describing the use of propranolol for airway lesions. This  retrospective case series was carried out at a tertiary pediatric medical  center. We obtained the following results: two children demonstrated significant  response to oral propranolol therapy and avoided not only invasive surgical  procedures, but also long-term administration of oral corticosteroids. This is  the first report of treating infantile airway hemangiomas with only propranolol  without additional surgical intervention or corticosteroid use. Review of literature reveals initial case series with similar, successful results using  propranolol as an adjuvant treatment along with other medications and surgical  interventions. We conclude that the initial use of propranolol as the sole treatment for infantile airway hemangioma is promising. Literature review  reveals that propranolol as the sole treatment for most head and neck  hemangiomas shows significant promise based on early case reports. Further  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ","24155599, 30719578, 20071038, 28030966",Epistaxis is a frequent complication associated with dental implant placement.,"30719578, 24155599",0.892,[0.487 0.5   0.14  0.511],[0.572 0.559 0.185 0.364],0.803

Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context:  Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by hyperglycemia, anion-gap acidosis, and  increased plasma ketones. After the resolution of hyperglycemia, persistent  diuresis is rare. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes who was treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)  inhibitor (canagliflozin) who developed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and  persistent diuresis in the absence of hyperglycemia. Physicians should consider euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the differential diagnosis of patients  treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.  ,  Context: is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and  maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in  103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and  neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.  INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms  scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and  ,  Context: group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well  tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority).

It has several advantages over PCR-based  techniques, including avoidance of amplification, direct sequence interrogation  and digital detection for absolute quantification. These features minimize  aspects of experimental error and hold promise for dealing with challenging  experimental conditions such as archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. However, systematic inter-sample technical artifacts caused by  variability in sample preservation, bio-molecular extraction and platform  fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data. RESULTS: To facilitate this process and to address these issues for NanoString  datasets, we have written a pre-processing package called NanoStringNorm in the  R statistical language.

Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment. A module was implemented on an FPGA to compute the score of a single cell of the SW matrix, and a grid of this module was used to compute"," Context: BACKGROUND: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman  (SW) algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two  sequences. When searching sequence databases that may contain hundreds of  millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: Reconfigurable systolic arrays can be adapted to efficiently resolve a wide  spectrum of computational problems; parallelism is naturally explored in  systolic arrays and reconfigurability allows for redefinition of the  interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context: Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs.

List R packages for lipidomics,"lipidr and Rodin are two R packages mentioned for lipidomics analysis.

With lipidomics datasets  becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required  to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating  lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and  unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets.  lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for  targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically  inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names.

As RA patients might be treated  with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of  filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. METHODS: The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential  interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism.

Likewise, metabolic syndrome and its associated traits  are major contributing factors to the increase in nephropathy and end stage  renal disease. The specific factors that link the metabolic syndrome traits to  the progression of nephropathy remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have  demonstrated that an imbalance between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cytochrome  P450 (CYP450) arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes in the kidney may contribute  to the renal damage associated with obesity. Along these lines, COX-2 inhibition  decreases renal cytokine levels and glomerular injury in obese rats. Peroxisome  proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that also contribute to chronic kidney disease in obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Intriguingly, interactions between PPARs and arachidonic acid metabolites could  be key determinants of renal damage in metabolic syndrome patients.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates cell survival by keeping p53 levels in check in progenitor cells. It also modulates the stability and translation of many target mRNAs, including occludin mRNA, enhancing its translation. Additionally, HuR is involved in regulating"," Context: cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic  fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: following reasons. We did not observe any significant regulation of expression  of the genes coding for HU by IHF, or vice-versa. The structures that these two  proteins form with double-stranded or single-stranded DNA are completely  different. Finally, overexpression of IHF does not relieve the growth defects  observed in HU-less mutants. However, it can be speculated from our results that  even if the two proteins are not equivalent and cannot replace one another, both  could stimulate (or inhibit) some specific protein-DNA interactions or affect  the DNA-binding properties of one another.  ,  Context: Occludin is a transmembrane tight junction (TJ) protein that plays an important  role in TJ assembly and regulation of the epithelial barrier function, but the  mechanisms underlying its post-transcriptional regulation are unknown. The  RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target  mRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin  expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. HuR  bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin  translation. HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent  HuR phosphorylation. Reduced HuR phosphorylation by Chk2 silencing or by reduction of Chk2 through polyamine depletion decreased HuR-binding to the  occludin mRNA and repressed occludin translation, whereas Chk2 overexpression  enhanced (HuR/occludin mRNA) association and stimulated occludin expression. In mice exposed to septic stress induced by cecal ligation and puncture, Chk2  levels in the intestinal mucosa decreased, associated with an inhibition of  occludin expression and gut barrier dysfunction.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of budding yeast, rather than DNA sequence-specified nucleosome positioning."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood.

The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers.

Verprolin proteins, such as Vrp1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are conserved family proteins that regulate actin binding and endocytosis. Here, we  identified and characterized MoVrp1 as the yeast Vrp1 homolog in Magnaporthe  oryzae. Deletion of the MoVRP1 gene resulted in defects in vegetative growth, asexual development, and infection of the host plant. The ∆Movrp1 mutants also  exhibited decreased extracellular peroxidase and laccase activities and showed  defects in colony pigmentation, hyphal surface hydrophobicity, cell wall  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context:  Several aspects of the intermediate filaments' molecular architecture remain  mysterious despite decades of study. The growth process and the final  architecture may depend on the physical, chemical, and biochemical environment. Aiming at clarifying this issue, we have revisited the structure of the human  hair follicle by means of X-ray microdiffraction. We conclude that the  histology-based growth zones along the follicle are correlated to the fine architecture of the filaments deduced from X-ray microdiffraction. Our analysis  reveals the existence of two major polymorph intermediate filament  architectures. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a  ","18726512, 28117435, 1694790, 16458019","No. Desmins are type III intermediate filament (IF) proteins that have been identified to date only in metazoa (human, Danio rerio, bovine).

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68. They contain consensus Sam68 binding sites."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) include a series of malignant tumors arising in  epithelial tissues, typically oral cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer  and thyroid cancer. HNCs are important contributors to cancer incidence and  mortality, leading to approximately 225,100 new patients and 77,500 deaths in  China every year. Determination of the mechanisms of HNC carcinogenesis and  progression is an urgent priority in HNC treatment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNAs longer than 200 bps. lncRNAs have been reported to  participate in a broad scope of biological processes, and lncRNA dysregulation  leads to diverse human diseases, including cancer. In this review, we focus on lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HNCs, summarize the latest findings regarding  the function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in HNC carcinogenesis and  progression, and discuss the clinical application of lncRNAs in HNC diagnosis,  ,  Context: signatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA  cross-linking and reverse transcription. We found that these antibodies  similarly induced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a  modification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these  signatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and  mouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of  m6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

CONTACT: alice.heliou@lix.polytechnique.fr or solon.pissis@kcl.ac.uk.  ,  Context: on a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata  (Crochemore et al., 1998). No implementation of this algorithm is publicly  available. There also exists an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see  text]-space algorithm for the same problem based on the construction of suffix  arrays (Pinho et al., 2009). An implementation of this algorithm was also  provided by the authors and is currently the fastest available.  RESULTS: Our contribution in this article is twofold: first, we bridge this  unpleasant gap by presenting an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see  text]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words based on the construction of suffix arrays; and second, we provide the respective  implementation of this algorithm. Experimental results, using real and synthetic  data, show that this implementation outperforms the one by Pinho et al. The open-source code of our implementation is freely available at  http://github.com/solonas13/maw . CONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being  ,  Context: existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the  data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow  ,  Context: An absent word (also called a forbidden word or an unword in other contexts) in  a sequence is a segment that does not appear in the given sequence. It is a  minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in the given sequence. In  this article, we review the concept of minimal absent words, which includes the  notion of shortest absent words but is much stronger. We present an efficient  method for computing the minimal absent words of bounded length for DNA sequence using a Trie of bounded depth, representing bounded length factors. This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions. We also present an approach to distinguish sequences of different organisms  using their minimal absent words. Our solution applies a length-weighted index  to discriminate sequences and the results show that we can build phylogenetic  ","28407038, 25526884, 19426495, 22974263",emMAW,28407038,1.0,[0.725 0.627 0.767 0.503],[0.152 0.093 0.114 0.048],0.096
Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package available on Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/) that has been developed for detecting hierarchical, biologically relevant Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)."," Context: for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor,  http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .  ,  Context: that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in  yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates  an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family  members. Using this experimental system, we also demonstrate that mammalian cDNA  libraries can be screened successfully for cDNAs encoding novel bHLH proteins  that interact with E-box targets. Thus, this in vivo yeast system provides a  novel approach to facilitate functional studies of bHLH factor regulation.  ,  Context: or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single  plot.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,"Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose, live attenuated vaccine in the form of an oral suspension."," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To review trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vaxchora, a  reformulated, single-dose, oral, lyophilized Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine  for the prevention of travel-related cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1.  DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946 to January  week 3, 2017) and EMBASE (1996 to 2017 week 3). Keywords included oral cholera  vaccine, single-dose, Vaxchora, and CVD 103-HgR. Limits included human, clinical trials published in English since 2010. ClinicalTrials.gov was used as a source  for unpublished data. Additional data sources were obtained through  bibliographic review of selected articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that addressed the safety and  efficacy of Vaxchora, the reformulated, single-dose oral CVD 103-HgR cholera  vaccine, were selected for analysis.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is being developed as a safer  smallpox vaccine and is being placed in the US Strategic National Stockpile  (SNS) as a liquid formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration at a dose of 1×10(8) TCID50 in a volume of 0.5mL. This study compared the safety and  immunogenicity of the standard formulation, dose and route with both a more  stable, lyophilized formulation and with an antigen-sparing intradermal (ID)  route of administration. METHODS: 524 subjects were randomized to receive either a full dose of  Lyophilized-SC, a full dose of Liquid-SC or 20% (2×10(7) TCID50 in 0.1mL) of a  full dose Liquid-ID MVA on Days 0 and 28.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and  we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  ","30276444, 18606711, 18088248, 29374079",The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).,"27347137, 16777955, 18521959, 25339659, 21396113, 25541140, 16709748, 25650422, 18606711, 18682521, 30276444, 29374079",0.847,[0.496 0.474 0.406 0.506],[0.65  0.587 0.485 0.646],0.811
Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit proteins and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first fib"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic  binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These  results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly  under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not  ,  Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have  ,  Context: acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome  side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to  suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or  antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of  MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs,  (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that  specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands  generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably  separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP  antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce  analgesia with reduced tolerance. The type of response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone and naltrindole as  above) and the space between them. Production and evaluation of bivalent ligands  is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are  ","31939155, 30700556, 29217730, 19474215",Roundabouts comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein family emanating from the midline.,"29217730, 31939155, 30700556, 30820596",0.815,[0.672 0.518 0.423 0.512],[0.774 0.717 0.606 0.438],0.817
Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. It actually blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: receiving 125 mg of AZD0530 was discontinued from the study due to the  development of congestive heart failure and atypical pneumonia, which were  considered possibly related to the study drug. Plasma/CSF ratio of AZD0530 was  0.4. The 100 mg and 125 mg doses achieved CSF drug levels corresponding to brain  levels that rescued memory deficits in transgenic mouse models. One-month  treatment with AZD0530 had no significant effect on clinical efficacy measures  or regional cerebral glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with  mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg. Targeting Fyn kinase may be a promising  therapeutic approach in AD, and a larger Phase IIa clinical trial of AZD0530 for  the treatment of patients with AD has recently launched. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01864655. Registered 12 June 2014.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone blocks the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), which significantly reduces androgen production. Additionally, it has activity against AR and 3-β-hydroxysteroid de"," Context: The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend  survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate  cancer. Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is  currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our  previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to  enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance  exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that  enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have  determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown  of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment. Furthermore, targeting AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant  cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment through AR-V7 inhibition.  Chronic apalutamide treatment in C4-2B cells activates the steroid hormone  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: production of intratumoral androgens are necessary. The introduction of  abiraterone, a potent suppressor of cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase-mediated androgen production, has heralded a new era in the  hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC.

Conventional therapies targeting hormone receptors (HR) and human  epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) are ineffective and often chemotherapy is  standard-of-care. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  comprised of an active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, bound to a humanized  monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblastic cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2).

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg syndrome and congenital Horner syndrome are recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context: In forensic analysis predictive tests for external visible characteristics (or  EVCs), including inference of iris color, represent a potentially useful tool to  guide criminal investigations. Two recent studies, both focused on forensic  testing, have analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes underlying  common eye color variation (Mengel-From et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 4:323  and Walsh et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 5:170). Each study arrived at different recommendations for eye color predictive tests aiming to type the most  closely associated SNPs, although both confirmed rs12913832 in HERC2 as the key  predictor, widely recognized as the most strongly associated marker with blue and brown iris colors. Differences between these two studies in identification  of other eye color predictors may partly arise from varying approaches to  assigning phenotypes, notably those not unequivocally blue or dark brown and  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in  congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: errors commonly explain the loss of the inactive X chromosome (Xi), but  compromise of Xi heterochromatin in some cancers may signal broader deficits of  nuclear heterochromatin. The debated link between BRCA1 and Xi might reflect a  general relationship between BRCA1 and heterochromatin, which could connect  BRCA1 to both epigenetic and genetic instability. We suggest that  heterochromatic instability is a common but largely unexplored mechanism,  leading to widespread genomic misregulation and the evolution of some cancers.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have been found to reduce norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue, leading to a marked reduction in glycerol release. This suggests that thyronamines may indeed have an effect on fat tissue,"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both  systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma  glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced  any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that  central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute  alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following  systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act  centrally to modulate glucose metabolism.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  often activated in human diseases, such as cancer, mTOR signaling pathways are  deactivated in ischemic diseases. From Drosophila to humans, mTOR is necessary  for Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, and the regulation of Akt-mTOR signaling  pathways may have a potential role in ischemic disease. This review evaluates  the potential functions of mTOR in ischemic diseases. A novel mTOR-interacting  protein deregulates over-expression in ischemic disease, representing a new mechanism for controlling mTOR signaling pathways and potential therapeutic  strategies for ischemic diseases.  ,  Context: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a ligand of RET tyrosine  kinase, and its family ligands promote the survival and differentiation of a  variety of neurons. Gene ablation studies have revealed that the GDNF-RET  receptor system is essential for the development of kidney and peripheral  neurons, including sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric neurons. RET can  activate various signaling pathways such as RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, p38 mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. These  signaling pathways are activated via binding of adaptor proteins to intracellular tyrosine residues of RET phosphorylated by its own kinase  activity. The RET is profoundly involved in the development of several human  neuroendocrine diseases. The constitutive activation of the RET by somatic  ,  Context: incompletely understood. We investigated whether activation of AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK) prevents the hepatic insulin resistance that is induced by  the consumption of a high-protein diet (HPD) and the presence of excess amino  acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK  phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the  insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor  substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in  cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1),  consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8  (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of  mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated  protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both  complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members:  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKCα (protein kinase Cα) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced  protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated  single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of  Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2  components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover,  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"There is no national prostate cancer screening programme established in the United Kingdom. Despite this, many men undergo opportunistic screening, and some urologists use age-related PSA cut-off values, with 36% of respondents using these values. The Department"," Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen  (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening. CONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the  United Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a  screen for prostate cancer is contentious.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is involved in autoimmune thyroid disease.

Even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to"," Context: It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  ,  Context: patients received 200 μg of sodium selenite/day, orally, for 3 months, and 30  patients received placebo. All hypothyroid patients were given l-thyroxine  replacement. RESULTS: Of 30 patients in the selenium treated group, 6 patients were overtly  hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context: CONTEXT: The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is  incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed  the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally  been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Ospemifene is statistically significantly superior to placebo in treating dyspareunia at a 60-mg dose. However, at a 30-mg dose, it did not achieve statistically significant results for dyspareunia."," Context: vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has  been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in  postmenopausal women.  AIM: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy  and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal  vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized  double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of  vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The  reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A systematic  review and meta-analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six publications involving a total of 1,772 patients were  used in the analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that  were short-term (12 weeks) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo and three RCTs  ,  Context: Genital herpes is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the USA.  While sometimes mild in severity, it can be a distressing and painful chronic  condition. Likewise, herpes labialis and herpes zoster can be both physically  and psychologically painful. While there is no cure for these conditions,  treatment to alleviate symptoms, suppress recurrences and reduce transmission  has been drastically improved over the past 20 years with the use of guanine nucleoside antivirals, such as valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex),  GlaxoSmithKline) the highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax((R)),  GlaxoSmithKline), and famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir, Novartis). Clinical trials involving  approximately 10,000 patients (including patients from nongenital herpes  studies, such as herpes zoster) have assessed the safety and efficacy of  ,  Context: were having 5% or less superficial cells on the vaginal smear (maturation  index), vaginal pH greater than 5.0, and at least one moderate or severe symptom  of vulvovaginal atrophy. The four coprimary endpoints were the change from  baseline to 12 weeks in the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells on the  vaginal smear, change in vaginal pH, and change in severity of most bothersome  symptom (vaginal dryness or dyspareunia) compared with placebo. All participants  were given a nonhormonal vaginal lubricant for use as needed. RESULTS: Ospemifene was statistically significantly superior to placebo in each  of the coprimary endpoints at the 60-mg dose. Statistically significant results were achieved for all coprimary endpoints with the 30-mg dose except for  dyspareunia. Ospemifene was well tolerated at both doses and demonstrated a  favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with  vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: The nematode C. elegans is a useful model organism for studying neuronal  development and function due to its extremely simple, well-defined nervous  system, translucence, short life cycle, and abundance of genetic tools  (WormBase. http://wormbase.org , 2018; WormBook. The C. elegans Research  Community. http://www.wormbook.org , 2018). Due to the relative ease of genetic  transformation, the majority of studies in C. elegans use transgenes (e.g., green fluorescent proteins) to assess the expression and distribution of  specific proteins. In addition, large-scale in situ hybridization studies have  described the distribution of mRNAs for thousands of genes throughout development. However, there may be qualitative and quantitative differences  between expression of transgenic markers and the endogenous protein. Specific  antibodies can be difficult to generate, but once generated antibodies can be  ","32868918, 12949121, 11997343, 31552661",In C. elegans epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes.,32868918,0.987,[0.499 0.375 0.46  0.373],[0.763 0.601 0.676 0.536],0.729
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: from the myocardium of diabetic and wild-type rats were loaded with Fura-2, and  UTP-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) transients were compared under various combinations of  SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (PMCA) and NCX inhibitors. Diabetes  resulted in significant alterations in SERCA and NCX activities in CECs during  [Ca(2+)](i) sequestration and efflux, respectively, while no difference in PMCA  activity between diabetic and wild-type cells was observed. These results  improve our understanding of how diabetes affects calcium regulation in CECs,  and may contribute to the development of new therapies for DCM treatment.  ,  Context: sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: To observe the dynamic expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in  myocardium of diabetic rats and explore its role in diabetic cardiomyopathy  (DCM), 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups including  control, diabetic-4 weeks, diabetic-8 weeks and spermine treatment groups (240  μM of spermine in drinking water). The type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM) models were  established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg) after  high-fat and high-sugar diet for one month. The echocardiographic parameters  were measured, cardiac morphology was observed by electron microscope and HE  staining. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was detected by laser-scanning confocal microscope. Western blot analyzed the expression of  CaSR, protein kinase C α(PKC-α) and calcium handling regulators, such as  phospholamban (PLN), Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and ryanodine receptor (RyR).

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.," Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: Fingolimod (Gilenya; FTY720), a synthetic compound based on the fungal secondary  metabolite myriocin (ISP-I), is a potent immunosuppressant that was approved  (September 2010) by the U.S. FDA as a new treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).  Fingolimod was synthesized by the research group of Tetsuro Fujita at Kyoto  University in 1992 while investigating structure-activity relationships of  derivatives of the fungal metabolite ISP-I, isolated from Isaria sinclairii. Fingolimod becomes active in vivo following phosphorylation by sphingosine  kinase 2 to form fingolimod-phosphate, which binds to extracellular G  protein-coupled receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphates, and prevents the release of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue. Fingolimod is orally active, which is unique  among current first-line MS therapies, and it has the potential to be used in  the treatment of organ transplants and cancer. This review highlights the  ,  Context: relapsing MS. A study from the MSBase dataset found evidence that early  treatment with highly effective therapies decreased the risk of developing  secondary progressive MS. Ocrelizumab is highly efficacious in relapsing MS and  in a group of patients with primary progressive MS. Another CD20 directed mAb,  ofatumumab, is in phase 3. A large study examining extended interval dosing of  natalizumab in an attempt to decrease the risk of developing progressive  multifocal leukoencephalopathy is underway. Cladribine and alemtuzumab may work  by immune reconstitution. Siponimod was recently approved by United States  Federal Drug Administration for relapsing MS and active secondary progressive MS. Other S1P receptor modulators are being studied in phase 3 trials for  relapsing MS. Cladribine received FDA approval as treatment for relapsing and  active secondary progressive MS. Autologous hematopoetic stem-cell transplantation may be an option for treatment-refractory MS. SUMMARY: Development of disease-modifying agents in MS continues to be  successful. Treatment algorithms need to take new developments into account.  ,  Context: of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase  (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN expression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and its protein interactions may explain its role in these processes. It also plays a crucial role in the organization and function of super enhancers, which regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context: and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers,  including breast and prostate cancer. In addition to its role in genomic  signaling, MED12 has been implicated in non-genomic signaling by interacting  with and activating TGF-beta receptor 2 in the cytoplasm. Recent structural  studies have revealed extensive inter-domain interactions and complex  architecture of the Mediator-Pol II complex, suggesting that Mediator is capable  of reorganizing its conformation and composition to fit cellular needs. We  propose that alterations in Mediator subunit expression that occur in various  cancers could impact the organization and function of Mediator, resulting in changes in gene expression that promote malignancy. A better understanding of  the role of Mediator in cancer could reveal new approaches to the diagnosis and  treatment of Mediator-dependent endocrine cancers, especially in settings of therapy resistance.  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.

It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy.

Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin).

We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89.
