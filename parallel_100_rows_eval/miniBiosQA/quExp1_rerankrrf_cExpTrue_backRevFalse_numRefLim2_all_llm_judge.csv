What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella).

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,There is no mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. The provided information only discusses their involvement in cell proliferation and mitosis.," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in any genome. It has been tested as a case study on the fly genome.," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease (LBD) is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy that is characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies in the central and sympathetic nervous systems.," Context: Protein aggregation within the central nervous system has been recognized as a  defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases since the early 20th century.  Since that time, there has been a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders,  including Parkinson disease, which are characterized by inclusions of specific  pathogenic proteins. This has led to the long-held dogma that these  characteristic protein inclusions, which are composed of large insoluble  fibrillar protein aggregates and visible by light microscopy, are responsible  for cell death in these diseases. However, the correlation between protein  inclusion formation and cytotoxicity is inconsistent, suggesting that another form of the pathogenic proteins may be contributing to neurodegeneration. There  is emerging evidence implicating soluble oligomers, smaller protein aggregates  not detectable by conventional microscopy, as potential culprits in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein α-synuclein is well  recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and is the  major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. However, α-synuclein also  ,  Context: We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we  added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological  characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection.

What is the purpose of HaploReg v4?,HaploReg V4.1 is used to understand functional annotation on important single nucleotide variations (SNVs).," Context: More than 90% of common variants associated with complex traits do not affect  proteins directly, but instead the circuits that control gene expression. This  has increased the urgency of understanding the regulatory genome as a key  component for translating genetic results into mechanistic insights and  ultimately therapeutics. To address this challenge, we developed HaploReg  (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) to aid the functional dissection of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal  variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and  the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, resulting in co-upregulation of surrounding genes. This is observed during rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations,"," Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: Chromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the  spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive  site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2  motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the ""core"", which provide enhancer  blocking activity and reduce position effects. However, the core alone does not  insulate viral vectors effectively. The full-length cHS4 has excellent  insulating properties, but its large size severely compromises vector titers. We  performed a structure-function analysis of cHS4 flanking lentivirus-vectors and  analyzed transgene expression in the clonal progeny of hematopoietic stem cells and epigenetic changes in cHS4 and the transgene promoter. We found that the  core only reduced the clonal variegation in expression. Unique insulator  activity resided in the distal 400 bp cHS4 sequences, which when combined with the core, restored full insulator activity and open chromatin marks over the  transgene promoter and the insulator. These data consolidate the known  insulating activity of the canonical 5' core with a novel 3' 400 bp element with  ","19160492, 19746166",Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes.

The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.

This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"No, there is no indication in the provided information that STAT3 is regulated by mTORC1. In fact, the two contexts mention different signaling pathways: PI3K-mTORC1 is mentioned in relation to heat shock protein translation, while"," Context:  Protein synthesis is a key regulated cellular process that links nutrient  availability and organismal growth. It has long been known that some cellular  proteins continue to be synthesized under conditions where global translation is severely compromised. One prominent example is the selective translation of heat  shock proteins (Hsps) under stress conditions. Although the transcriptional  regulation of Hsp genes has been well established, neither the specific translation-promoting features nor the regulatory mechanism of the translation  machinery have been clearly defined. Here we show that the stress-induced  preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1  ,  Context: for more than 48 h, was elicited upon induction of adipogenesis. Both the  STAT3-selective inhibitor stattic and the JAK2 (Janus kinase 2)/STAT3-selective  inhibitors AG490 and Gö6976 inhibited STAT3 activation, leading to the  suppression of adipocyte differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation was also  suppressed by STAT3 siRNA (small interfering RNA) or dominant-negative STAT3.  Interestingly, the PPARgamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma)  agonist TAZ (troglitazone) abolished the STAT3-inhibitor- and RNAi (RNA  interference)-mediated suppression of adipogenesis. However, TAZ treatment had  no effect on the stattic- and AG490-mediated down-regulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting that STAT3 regulates adipocyte differentiation through  signalling that occurs upstream of PPARgamma.

Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature.  RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible.

It is an  early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of  desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  ,  Context: Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the  3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up  to 250-300 nucleotides long.

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,"PMP22 is a gene that has been found duplicated, underlying CMT1A. No specific mutations are mentioned in this context, only duplication of the PMP22 gene."," Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context: Duplication of the gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa (PMP22)  underlies the most common inherited neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A),  a disease without a known cure. Although demyelination represents a  characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the  degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and  impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological  abnormalities are already present in childhood.

Circular RNAs can be produced by the direct ligation of 5' and 3' ends  of linear RNAs, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, or by  ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges.

In  mammals, the initially flat neural plate bends and lifts bilaterally to generate  the neural folds followed by fusion of the folds at the midline during the  process of neural tube closure (NTC). Failures in any step of this process can  lead to neural tube defects (NTDs), a common class of birth defects that occur in approximately 1 in 1000 live births. These severe birth abnormalities include  spina bifida, a failure of closure at the spinal level; craniorachischisis, a  failure of NTC along the entire body axis; and exencephaly, a failure of the cranial neural folds to close which leads to degeneration of the exposed brain  tissue termed anencephaly.

It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses  and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be impaired and iron is pooled within macrophages.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare benign condition. It manifests endoscopically  as discrete, flat, small brown-black spots in the duodenal mucosa. It produces  no symptoms and may be reversible. The cause and natural history of the pigmentation have not been clarified, although it is associated with a variety  of systemic illnesses and medications. With electron microscopy and  electron-probe energy dispersive X-ray analysis, the pigment corresponds principally to an accumulation of ferrous sulfide (FeS) in macrophages within  the lamina propria.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through  receptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate  variant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the  normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an  inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"Filoviruses are among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%."," Context: Mites in the genus Tropilaelaps (Acari: Laelapidae) are ectoparasites of the  brood of honey bees (Apis spp.). Different Tropilaelaps subspecies were  originally described from Apis dorsata, but a host switch occurred to the  Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, for which infestations can rapidly lead to  colony death. Tropilaelaps is hence considered more dangerous to A. mellifera  than the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Honey bees are also infected by many  different viruses, some of them associated with and vectored by V. destructor.  In recent years, deformed wing virus (DWV) has become the most prevalent virus  infection in honey bees associated with V. destructor. DWV is distributed world-wide, and found wherever the Varroa mite is found, although low levels of  the virus can also be found in Varroa free colonies. The Varroa mite transmits  viral particles when feeding on the haemolymph of pupae or adult bees. Both the Tropilaelaps mite and the Varroa mite feed on honey bee brood, but no  observations of DWV in Tropilaelaps have so far been reported.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are MEC-17 (acetyltransferase), SIRT2 (deacetylase), and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6)."," Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells.

Within tumors, macrophages can reversibly alter  their endotype in response to environmental cues, including hypoxia and stimuli  derived from other immune cells, as well as the extracellular matrix. Depending  on their activation status, macrophages can exert dual influences on  tumorigenesis by either antagonizing the cytotoxic activity immune cells or by  enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions. Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer  ,  Context: strategy for cancer therapy.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"NOMe-Seq measures the methylation status of cytosines in specific sequence contexts, specifically 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in RNA."," Context: understanding the repertoire of RNA modifications is a huge undertaking. This  review summarizes what is known about RNA modifications with an emphasis on  discoveries in plants. RNA ribose modifications, base methylations and  pseudouridylation are required for normal development in Arabidopsis, as  mutations in the enzymes modifying them have diverse effects on plant  development and stress responses. These modifications can regulate RNA  structure, turnover and translation. Transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA  modifications have been mapped extensively and their functions investigated in  many organisms, including plants. Recent work exploring the locations, functions and targeting of N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A), 5-methylcytosine (m5 C),  pseudouridine (Ψ), and additional modifications in mRNAs and ncRNAs are  highlighted, as well as those previously known on tRNAs and rRNAs. Many questions remain as to the exact mechanisms of targeting and functions of  specific modified sites and whether these modifications have distinct functions  in the different classes of RNAs.  ,  Context: A common feature of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) is that they can undergo a variety  of chemical modifications. As nearly all of these chemical modifications result  in an increase in the mass of the canonical nucleoside, mass spectrometry has  long been a powerful approach for identifying and characterizing modified RNAs.  Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in method  development and software for interpreting tandem mass spectra resulting in approaches that can yield qualitative and quantitative information on RNA  modifications, often at the level of sequence specificity. We discuss these  advances along with instrumentation developments that have increased our ability to extract such information from relatively complex biological samples.

IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.

Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.  Methods and Results We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM  families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin  heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  Conclusion These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of NCCM and suggest  that the molecular classification of cardiomyopathies includes an  MYH7-associated spectrum of NCCM with HCM, RCM, and DCM.  ,  Context: disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) in mammalian cells, including humans."," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered).

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by counteracting DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase through its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. This interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, likely by CDK/DDK"," Context: timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end,  and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ","24879017, 24656819","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some adaptive role. This implies that cephalopods may actually use RNA editing more frequently"," Context: RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded  by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many  eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral  protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of  ","28855414, 29048557","Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone (a type of TZD) are combined in a single pill called Avandamet.," Context: active-controlled trial. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated  hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5%) receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg)  were recruited from 21 centers in China (from 19 November, 2009 to 15 March,  2011). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients who  reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% between Avandamet and metformin treatment. RESULTS: At week 48, 83.33% of patients reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% in  Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with  significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was reached  in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin treatment.

U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria.

According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively.

High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP-Med complex consists of multiple subunits, including Med220 and Med70."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is demonstrated by the fact that EVs were purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically through its α2 isoform which associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context: Upon exposure to various environmental stresses such as arsenite, hypoxia, and  heat shock, cells inhibit their translation and apoptosis and then repair  stress-induced alterations, such as DNA damage and the accumulation of misfolded  proteins. These types of stresses induce the formation of cytoplasmic RNA  granules called stress granules (SGs). SGs are storage sites for the many mRNAs  released from disassembled polysomes under these stress conditions and are  essential for the selective translation of stress-inducible genes.  Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a  component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. In this study, we examined the role of G3BP2, a close relative of G3BP1, in SG  formation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells  partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number. G3BP2 formed a  homo-multimer and a hetero-multimer with G3BP1. Moreover, like G3BP1, the  overexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli. Collectively,  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP's function is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that PAPOLA/PAP might be involved in some cellular process regulated by translational regulation and transcriptional control, as its expression is affected"," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function results in impaired Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.," Context: Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) belongs to a  secreted and membrane-tethered multidomain SCUBE protein family composed of  three members found in vertebrates and mammals. Recent reports suggested that  zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle. However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  ,  Context:  Mouse coding region determinant-binding (mCRD-BP) and human IGF-II mRNA-binding  1 (hIMP-1) proteins are orthologous mRNA-binding proteins that recognize c-myc  and IGF-II mRNA, respectively, and regulate their expression posttranscriptionally.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease, specifically for motor function loss in pediatric patients ≥3 years of age in the USA, and for all ages in the EU."," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001).

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,I am uncertain about the specific organs for which 3D printing has been tested.," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2, as it is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. According to the results, 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period after intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane for dental implant placement."," Context: MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration.

A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved  treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from  inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a  novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in  patients with CD.  METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female).  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is as it is not mentioned in the provided context.," Context: γ-H2AX, is an excellent indicator or marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).  The yield of γ-H2AX (foci) is shown to have some correlation with the dose of  radiation or other DSB-causing agents. However, there is some discrepancy in the  DNA DSB foci yield among imaging and other methods such as gel electrophoresis.  Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential  tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost  two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to  image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of γ-H2AX foci formation  after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured  illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and  HyVolution 2. We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques with as low as 30-nm resolution, each focus may be further resolved, thus  increasing the number of foci per radiation dose compared to standard  microscopy.

Unexpectedly, when C57BL/6 mice were  infected with PVM, the innate inflammatory response was undetectable until day 5  postinfection, at which time CD8(+) T cells infiltrated into the lung, initiating a cytokine storm by their production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and  tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Administration of an immunomodulatory  sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1R) agonist significantly inhibited PVM-elicited cytokine storm by blunting the PVM-specific CD8(+) T cell response,  resulting in diminished pulmonary disease and enhanced survival.

List R packages for lipidomics,lipidr is an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets.," Context: The rapid evolution of mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics has enabled the  simultaneous measurement of numerous lipid classes. With lipidomics datasets  becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required  to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating  lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and  unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets.  lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for  targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically  inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names.

The provided information only mentions that calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are metabolized by the C," Context: drugs include small-molecule drugs, depleting and nondepleting protein drugs  (polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies), fusion proteins, intravenous immune  globulin, and glucocorticoids. Small-molecule immunosuppressive agents include  calcineurin-inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), Target-of-Rapamycin  Inhibitors (Sirolimus, Everolimus), inhibitors of nucleotide synthesis and  azathioprine. The review covers the mode of action of these drugs with a special  focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby keeping p53 levels in check and promoting cell survival."," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ","19884656, 23223443","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization in budding yeast.," Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no mention of desmins in the provided context. The context only discusses long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their potential role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in plants, specifically in maize."," Context: BACKGROUND: Computational analysis of cDNA sequences from multiple organisms  suggests that a large portion of transcribed DNA does not code for a functional  protein. In mammals, noncoding transcription is abundant, and often results in  functional RNA molecules that do not appear to encode proteins. Many long  noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to have epigenetic regulatory function in  humans, including HOTAIR and XIST. While epigenetic gene regulation is clearly  an essential mechanism in plants, relatively little is known about the presence  or function of lncRNAs in plants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore the connection between lncRNA and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in plants, a computational pipeline  using the programming language Python has been developed and applied to maize  full length cDNA sequences to identify, classify, and localize potential lncRNAs. The pipeline was used in parallel with an SVM tool for identifying  ncRNAs to identify the maximal number of ncRNAs in the dataset.

The former antibody recognizes  specifically ghrelin with n- octanoylated Ser 3 (acyl ghrelin), and does not  recognize des-acyl ghrelin. The latter also recognizes des-acyl ghrelin (i.e.  total ghrelin). Intracerebroventricular treatment with the anti-ghrelin  antiserum against the N-terminal region twice a day for 5 days decreased  significantly both daily food intake and body weight. Des-acyl ghrelin levels  were significantly higher in the gastric vein than in the trunk. Either fasting  for 12 h, administration of gastrin or cholecystokinin resulted in increase of  both acyl and des-acyl ghrelin levels. The ghrelin levels exhibited a diurnal pattern, with the bimodal peaks occurring before dark and light periods. These  two peaks were consistent with maximum and minimum volumes of gastric content  respectively. These results suggest that (1) endogenous centrally released ghrelin participates in the regulation of food intake and body weight, (2) acyl  ghrelin is secreted from the stomach, (3) intestinal hormones stimulate ghrelin  release from the stomach, and (4) regulation of the diurnal rhythm of ghrelin is  ","22916204, 12176667","No. Desmins are type III intermediate filament (IF) proteins that have been identified to date only in metazoa (human, Danio rerio, bovine).

Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection.

Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent  structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis. Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion.

In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity.

Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia.

Since this discovery, two  representatives of TAMs, namely 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and thyronamine  (T(0)AM), have been detected in vivo. Intraperitoneal or central injection of  3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt  effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy,  negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient,  ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass. Although their physiological function  remains elusive, 3-T(1)AM and T(0)AM have already revealed promising therapeutic  potential because they represent the only endogenous compounds inducing hypothermia as a prophylactic or acute treatment of stroke and might thus be  expected to cause fewer side effects than synthetic compounds.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context: CONTEXT: The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is  incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed  the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally  been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed.

In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest  that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: predicted genes were not contained in the current genome annotation.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: Depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and Ca(2+)-release  channels (ryanodine receptor RyR2) are involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy,  however, the implication of intracellular calcium handling proteins in SR is  undefined. It was hypothesized that the down-regulation of the intracellular  calcium handling proteins of SR is closely related to an up-regulated endothelin  (ET) system.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2010 as a new treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).," Context: Fingolimod (Gilenya; FTY720), a synthetic compound based on the fungal secondary  metabolite myriocin (ISP-I), is a potent immunosuppressant that was approved  (September 2010) by the U.S. FDA as a new treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).  Fingolimod was synthesized by the research group of Tetsuro Fujita at Kyoto  University in 1992 while investigating structure-activity relationships of  derivatives of the fungal metabolite ISP-I, isolated from Isaria sinclairii. Fingolimod becomes active in vivo following phosphorylation by sphingosine  kinase 2 to form fingolimod-phosphate, which binds to extracellular G  protein-coupled receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphates, and prevents the release of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue. Fingolimod is orally active, which is unique  among current first-line MS therapies, and it has the potential to be used in  the treatment of organ transplants and cancer. This review highlights the  ,  Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,Mediator links to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space.," Context: polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to  transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach  ,  Context: latest findings on this topic. The PcG proteins are well-conserved chromatin  factors that repress transcription of numerous target genes. They bind the  genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone  modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures. These 3D chromatin  structures involve the interactions between PcG-bound regulatory regions at  short- and long-range distances, and may significantly contribute to PcG  function. Recent high throughput ""Chromosome Conformation Capture"" (3C) analyses  have revealed many other higher order structures along the chromatin fiber,  partitioning the genomes into well demarcated topological domains. This revealed an unprecedented link between linear epigenetic domains and chromosome  architecture, which might be intimately connected to genome function.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Colistin is mentioned as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii infection, suggesting it has antimicrobial properties. Additionally, it is discussed in relation to its potential use in combination with another antibiotic, chloramphenicol, indicating that col"," Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.
