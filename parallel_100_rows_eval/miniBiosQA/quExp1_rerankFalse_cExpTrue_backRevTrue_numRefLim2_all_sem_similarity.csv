What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), has been implicated in carcinogenesis and its dysregulation contributes to medulloblastoma.

We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9).

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function causes defective endochondral bone formation and impairs Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.," Context: zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle. However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental  relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In  addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.854,[0.805 0.806],[0.809 0.811],0.967

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.
