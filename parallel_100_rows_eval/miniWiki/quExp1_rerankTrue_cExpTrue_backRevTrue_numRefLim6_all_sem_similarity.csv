The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners  . While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels .

He later noted that this move was ""partly on account of slavery,"" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S  . survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property. Lincoln was only nine when his mother, then thirty-four years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried  to Sarah Bush Johnston  . Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying ""Both were good boys, but I must say â both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see .""

They generally raise a small brood, and the parents cooperate in caring for the clutch and the young. During the cold season on the other hand the mates separate for several months to protect the egg  . Usually, the male stays with the egg and keeps it warm while the female goes to sea to find food for the baby. When the female comes back, they switch roles.  ,  Context: The male wolf will mount the female firmly from behind. After achieving coitus, the two form a copulatory tie once the male's bulbus glandis an erectile tissue located near the base of the canine penis swells and the female's vaginal muscles tighten  . Ejaculation is induced by the thrusting of the male's pelvis and the undulation of the female's cervix. The two become physically inseparable for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, during which the male will ejaculate multiple times .       After the initial ejaculation, the male may lift one of his legs over the female such that they are standing end-to-end; this is believed to be a defensive measure .  The mating ritual is repeated many times throughout the female's brief ovulation period, which occurs once per year per female unlike female dogs, whose estrus usually occurs twice per year.

The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules   one of the most important contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms  . For instance, John Dalton did not consider this possibility. Avogadro did not actually use the word ""atom"" as the words ""atom"" and ""molecule"" were used almost without difference  . He considered that there were three kinds of ""molecules,"" including an ""elementary molecule"" (our ""atom""). Also, a keener attention was given to the definition of mass, as distinguished from weight.  ,  Context:  Even though many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air, and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs.

May a single female lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime ?,Yes," Context:  A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are usually laid according to the substrate the larva will feed on upon hatching. Among others, they can be laid loose in the substrate (e.g . flour beetle), laid in clumps on leaves (e.g. Colorado potato beetle), or individually attached (e.g. mungbean beetle and other seed borers) or buried in the medium (e.g. carrot weevil).  ,  Context:  A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime.

They can reproduce until ages 55â60. Females give birth at intervals of about 5 years . Their gestation (pregnancy) period lasts about 22 months (630â660 days), the longest gestation period of any mammal, after which typically one calf is born. Twins are rare. Labour ranges in length from 5 minutes to 60 hours . The average length of labour is 11 hours. At birth, calves weigh around 90â115 kg (200â250 lb), and they gain 1 kg (2â2.5 lb) a day  ,  Context:  Pairing is generally short but in some cases will last for several hours. During pairing sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilise the egg.  ,  Context: Turtles lay eggs, like other reptiles, which are slightly soft and leathery. The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are elongated  . Their albumen is white and contains a different protein than bird eggs, such that it will not coagulate when cooked. Turtle eggs prepared to eat consist mainly of yolk  . In some species, temperature determines whether an egg develops into a male or a female: a higher temperature causes a female, a lower temperature causes a male. Large numbers of eggs are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand . They are then covered and left to incubate by themselves.  When the turtles hatch they squirm their way to the surface and make for the water. There are no known species wherein the mother cares for the young.  ,  Context:  Some penguins mate for life, others for just one season. They generally raise a small brood, and the parents cooperate in caring for the clutch and the young. During the cold season on the other hand the mates separate for several months to protect the egg . Usually, the male stays with the egg and keeps it warm while the female goes to sea to find food for the baby. When the female comes back, they switch roles.
