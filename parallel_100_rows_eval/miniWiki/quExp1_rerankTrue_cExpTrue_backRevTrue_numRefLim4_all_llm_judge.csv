They can also spend much of their lives on dry land  . Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections  . These projections, called ""papillae"", have a rich blood supply, and serve to increase the surface area of the cloaca. The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae, in much the same way that fish use gills to respire.  ,  Context: . The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules   one of the most important contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms  . For instance, John Dalton did not consider this possibility. Avogadro did not actually use the word ""atom"" as the words ""atom"" and ""molecule"" were used almost without difference  . He considered that there were three kinds of ""molecules,"" including an ""elementary molecule"" (our ""atom""). Also, a keener attention was given to the definition of mass, as distinguished from weight.
