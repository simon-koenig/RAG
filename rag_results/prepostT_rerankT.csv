What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"According to the provided context, the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Specifically, frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases and high expression of polycomb genes suggest a role for H3K27 methylation in Group 3 and 4 medulloblastomas. Additionally, copy number aberrations of genes with"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the  ,  Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ","23179372, 14688019, 19270706, 19270706, 19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"According to the provided context, STAG1 and STAG2 are core components of cohesin, an emerging tumour suppressor. They share high sequence identity, encode mutually exclusive cohesin subunits, and retain partially overlapping functions. The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that they play a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, as their simultaneous blocking leads to significant reduction in cell"," Context: alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.  We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"According to the provided context, there is a possible association between long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones and an increased risk of glioblastoma. The hazard ratio (HR) for glioblastoma was found to be 1.2 (95% confidence interval = 0.95-1.4) with >10-year latency, indicating a survival disadvantage for glioblastoma cases with long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones."," Context: radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer.  RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility  ,  Context: gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for  astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The  results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was  observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to  earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.  ,  Context: type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave  increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following  latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association  between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the  initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most  frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The estimated IR of glioma and GBM in this study was higher compared  with data from other studies carried out on European, Asian and US populations.

Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"According to the given context, the No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is applicable in identifying novel architectures in the fly genome. It is an efficient, organism-independent method that can be used without relying on known promoter elements."," Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context:  Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone  ,  Context:  Currently DNA profiling methods only compare a suspect's DNA with DNA left at  the crime scene. When there is no suspect, it would be useful for the police to  be able to predict what the person of interest looks like by analysing the DNA left behind in a crime scene. Determination of the age of the suspect is an  important factor in creating an identikit. Human somatic cells gradually lose  telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual  from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged  between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR.  ,  Context: Novel bi-directional duplex promoters (BDDP) were constructed by placing two  identical core promoters divergently on both upstream and downstream sides of  their duplicated enhancer elements. Estimates of promoter function were obtained  by creating versions of CaMV 35S and CsVMV BDDPs that contained reporter marker  genes encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and enhanced green fluorescent protein  (EGFP) interchangeably linked either to the upstream or downstream core  promoters. GUS was used for quantitative analysis of promoter function, whereas,  EGFP allowed visual qualitative evaluation. In addition, the GUS and EGFP genes  placed in downstream positions were modified by translational fusion with neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) to allow simultaneous monitoring of promoter  activity and selection of stable transformants. These versions of BDDP were  compared with each other and with equivalent unidirectional constructs by evaluating their expression in grape and tobacco. For 35S promoter constructs  tested in grape somatic embryos (SE), BDDP exhibited transient GUS expression  206- and 300-fold greater in downstream and upstream configurations,  ,  Context: (TSS).

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"According to the provided context, yes, the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay works with fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue."," Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling. In this review, 14 multigene assays are evaluated as to  their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval  status, and estimated cost-benefit ratio. Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.

The following conclusions were drawn from the entire body  of evidence: There is a lack of external validation to support the reliability  of Oncotype-DX; however, the current available evidence derived from internal  industry validation studies suggests that Oncotype-DX is reliable (i.e.,  Oncotype-DX is repeatable and reproducible).Current available evidence suggests  a moderate failure rate of Oncotype-DX testing; however, the failure rate  observed across clinical trials included in this review is likely inflated; the  current Ontario experience suggests an acceptably lower rate of test failure.In women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (stage I-II) that is  estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node  negative:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole (the latter  for postmenopausal women only),There is very low quality evidence that  Oncotype-DX can predict which women will benefit from adjuvant CMF/MF  ,  Context: Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Based on the provided context, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system."," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei.

Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of  PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"Based on the provided context, the NoSAS Score can be used for screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS)."," Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively.

The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a  sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight  recordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low  availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is  recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Based on the provided context information, the species associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) are:  * Pufferfish * North American garter snakes * Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms (specifically Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata)  These species have been mentioned in the context information as being associated with TTX."," Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly potent neurotoxin that blocks the action  potential by selectively binding to voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)). The  skeletal muscle Na(v) (Na(v)1.4) channels in most pufferfish species and certain North American garter snakes are resistant to TTX, whereas in most mammals they  are TTX-sensitive. It still remains unclear as to whether the difference in this  sensitivity among the various vertebrate species can be associated with adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated the adaptive evolution of the  vertebrate Na(v)1.4 channels. By means of the CODEML program of the PAML 4.3  package, the lineages of both garter snakes and pufferfishes were denoted to be  ,  Context: Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as  gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"Based on the provided context, I can confidently say that a selective sweep typically reduces genetic diversity around the adaptive site. However, it can also carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. This means that while the overall genetic variation may decrease near the adaptive site, a selective sweep can still increase genetic variation by introducing new haplotype variation through hitchhiking."," Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.

Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches.

The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps.

Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays  ,  Context: (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems.

In this study, function  of ATM on radiation-induced cell death in lung cancer H1299 cells was analysed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human lung cancer cells, H1299, were used, and cell  models with ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) were established by genetic engineering.  Radiosensitivity was analysed using colony formation assays. Western blotting  and co-immunoprecipitation were implemented to detect protein expression and  interaction. MDC staining and GFP-LC3 relocalization were used to detect  autophagy. RESULTS: Autophagy as well as phosphorylation of ATM was activated by ionizing  radiation. Both the inhibitor of ATM, KU55933 and ATM silencing reduced  phosphorylation of ATM and MAPKAPK2 expression. Both ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) cells displayed hypersensitivity. IR increased autophagy level by more than 129%  in DMSO-treated cells, while only by 47% and 27% in KU55933-treated and ATM(-/-)  cells respectively.

Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

One of the 'five pillars' to  achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP.  Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to  the once-daily regimen.

It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003).

Preoperative arterial  embolization (ideally 2 weeks before surgery) helps control intraoperative  bleeding during surgery for giant pelvic pseudotumors.  ,  Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving  the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients with giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor who can undergo appropriate surgical  treatment. This represents a safe and reasonable approach to sustainably relieve  pain and other symptoms with giant hemophilic pseudotumor in the abdomen.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"According to the provided context, yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor that promotes the transcription of PTEN, which inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling."," Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected.

Other important but more rare consequences of alkaptonuric ochronosis are  cardiovascular and urinary tract involvement. We present a case of ochronosis  with multiple visceral involvement: skin (fingers, ear sclera), severe spondylarthropaty with extensive calcifications of intervertebral discs and  reduced mobility, osteoarthritis of both knees, right hip ostonecrosis,  cardiovascular involvement (severe stenosis and insufficiency of aortic valve  ,  Context:  Fifty patients suffering from the ""exploding head syndrome"" are described. This  hitherto unreported syndrome is characterised by a sense of an explosive noise  in the head usually in the twilight stage of sleep. The associated symptoms are varied, but the benign nature of the condition is emphasised and neither  extensive investigation nor treatment are indicated.  ,  Context: The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology  characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial  paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The  orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen,  nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is  indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to  one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence  assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete  form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis  granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably  present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"According to the provided context, yes, there is alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development.

By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.  ,  Context: Hox clusters because of an additional ""teleost-specific"" genome duplication  event. By sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole  genome, here we provide evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese  lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This suggests that the lamprey lineage has  experienced an additional genome duplication after 1R and 2R. The relative age  of lamprey and human paralogs supports this hypothesis. Compared with  gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are unusually large. Several  conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the Hox clusters of  lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in individual  lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in  elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the  first two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the  lamprey and gnathostome lineages.  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise.

After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus.

Although demyelination represents a  characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the  degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and  impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological  abnormalities are already present in childhood. Here, we show in  Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early postnatal development, caused by imbalanced  activity of the PI3K-Akt and the Mek-Erk signaling pathways.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Based on the provided context, Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as:  * MicroRNA sponges * Reservoirs * Combining with RNA-binding proteins during the progression of multiple cancer types.  These functions suggest that circRNAs can regulate gene expression and potentially influence cellular processes."," Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types. Therefore, the present review  evaluated recent research articles in PubMed that were published between November 2017 and September 2020. Key word search strings included: 'Circular  RNA (circRNA) AND bladder cancer (BC)', 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND prostate  cancer (PCa)' and 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND renal cell cancer (RCC)'. In  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly stable forms of non-coding RNAs with diverse  biological functions. They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast  cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified. Circ-Seq  was then applied to a larger cohort of breast cancer samples (n = 885) provided  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are found across eukaryotes and can function in  post-transcriptional gene regulation. Their biogenesis through a circle-forming  backsplicing reaction is facilitated by reverse-complementary repetitive sequences promoting pre-mRNA folding. Orthologous genes from which circRNAs  arise, overall contain more strongly conserved splice sites and exons than other  genes, yet it remains unclear to what extent this conservation reflects purifying selection acting on the circRNAs themselves.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,"Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that nuclear TRalpha1 is overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1-adrenergic signalling by PE in neonatal cardiomyocytes. However, there is no specific information about which genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.  Therefore, I must say ""I don't know"" as there is no explicit detail provided to answer this question."," Context: including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The  results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the  balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: TRalpha1 and TRbeta, which act as T3-dependent transcription factors, was  investigated in receptor-deficient mice. Liver and kidney D1 mRNA and activity  levels were reduced in TRbeta(-/-) but not TRalpha1(-/-) mice. Liver D1 remained  weakly T3 inducible in TRbeta(-/-) mice whereas induction was abolished in  double mutant TRalpha1(-/-)TRbeta(-/-) mice. This indicates that TRbeta is  primarily responsible for regulating D1 expression whereas TRalpha1 has only a  minor role. In kidney, despite the expression of both TRalpha1 and TRbeta,  regulation relied solely on TRbeta, thus revealing a marked tissue restriction  in TR isotype utilization. Although TRbeta and TRalpha1 mediate similar functions in vitro, these results demonstrate differential roles in regulating  D1 expression in vivo and suggest that tissue-specific factors and structural  distinctions between TR isotypes contribute to functional specificity. Remarkably, there was an obligatory requirement for a TR, whether TRbeta or  TRalpha1, for any detectable D1 expression in liver. This suggests a novel  paradigm of gene regulation in which the TR sets both basal expression and the  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The  results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through  receptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate  variant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the  normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an  inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature.

The condition  is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that  share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established at the Public Health Agency of Canada with COVID-19 literature was searched for  articles referencing MIS-C, PIMS or Kawasaki Disease in relation to COVID-19.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,"According to the provided context, rilonacept is a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein that neutralizes both IL-1α and IL-1β. Therefore, the answer is:  Rilonacept targets IL-1α and IL-1β receptors."," Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial  involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and  background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response  (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: The progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases  provided a rational basis for the development of biologic disease‑modifying  antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which  have completely revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation.

In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes.  ,  Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  ","12024216, 34508164, 12024216, 34508164, 23126280, 26227334","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214"

A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients.

Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared. Data were  analyzed by repeated-measures one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test for finger  measurements and group comparisons and Pearson's and Spearman's tests for  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand, and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.

There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family  history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.

Although this is a small population sample with  possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure,  ,  Context: digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"According to the given context, enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved by the FDA on 1 August 2017 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory AML with IDH2 mutations. Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved by the FDA on 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory AML with IDH1 mutations."," Context: recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as  primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: Proteasomes are multisubunit enzyme complexes. They contain three enzymatic  active sites which are termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like.  The elementary function of the proteasomes is degradation of damaged proteins.  Proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of damaged protein, which leads to  caspase activation and cell death. This relationship is used in cancer therapy.  Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  Carfilzomib belongs to the second generation of drugs, which was approved by the  US FDA in 2012. Currently in the study phase there are four new inhibitors: ixazomib (MLN9780/MLN2238), delanzomib (CEP-18770), oprozomib (ONX0912/PR-047)  and marizomib (NPI-0052).  ,  Context:  Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Based on the provided context, isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (INCCM) can be connected to dilated cardiomyopathy in that both conditions are types of cardiomyopathies. INCCM is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculations and intertrabecular recesses, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy is marked by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. Both conditions can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events."," Context:  Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disease that is likely to  develop in the embryonic period. It is caused by the intrauterine arrest of the  myocardial compaction process in the beginning of the fetal development. It is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep intertrabecular  recesses, as well as the thickening of the myocardium into two distinct layers  (compacted and not compacted). Even though this disease is said to be prevalent in the pediatric population or together with congenital heart disease, one can  understand that this disease occurs in isolation, because the diagnosis is  becoming more common in adult patients that have no other heart disease. The  ,  Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure.

Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"According to the provided context, Rif1 regulates DNA replication by:  * Opposing DDK function through PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex * Directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) to prevent premature phosphorylation of Mcm4 * Regulating chromatin-loop sizes and higher-order chromatin architecture * Controlling DNA replication genome-wide  These mechanisms allow Rif1 to specify replication timing, regulate origin firing, and determine the replication domain structures"," Context: Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at  late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Our results indicate that Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining  the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating  higher-order chromatin architecture.  ,  Context: 1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that  Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4.

Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: dormant origins over a wide range of the chromosomes occurs in rif1Δ in the  presence or absence of hydroxyurea (HU). At the same time, many early-firing,  efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1Δ. Rif1  binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm  segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly  sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins  activated in rif1Δ. The binding to the arm segments occurs through M to G1 phase  in a manner independent of Taz1 and appears to be essential for the replication  timing program during the normal cell cycle. Our data demonstrate that Rif1 is a critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast  chromosomes.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"According to the provided context, the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It also participates in the Notch signaling pathway."," Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members.

The anterior-posterior compartment boundary is the place where signaling by the Hedgehog pathway takes  place, and this requires pathway activation in anterior cells by ligand  expressed exclusively in posterior cells. Several mechanisms ensure the confinement of hedgehog expression to posterior cells, including repression by  Cubitus interruptus, the co-repressor Groucho and Master of thick veins. In this  work we identified Kismet, a chromodomain-containing protein of the SNF2-like  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression.

Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.

Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects.

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"According to the provided context, it is stated that ""RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods..."". This suggests that cephalopods actually use RNA editing more frequently than other species."," Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates  derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded  by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many  eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral  protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins.

Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates  derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters.

This manuscript  reviews the pharmacology, safety and benefits of the combination pill Avandamet.  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Dosage  ,  Context: the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Andexanet alfa (r-Antidote,  PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) is a truncated form of enzymatically  inactive factor Xa, which binds and reverses the anticoagulant action of the  factor Xa inhibitors (e.g.: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban). Aripazine  (PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) is a synthetic small molecule (~500 Da)  that reverses oral dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, as well as subcutaneous  fondaparinux and LMWH in vivo. These antidotes could provide an alternative for  management of life-threatening bleeding events occurring with the  above-mentioned anticoagulants. In addition, the specific antidote anivamersen (RB007; Regado Biosciences Inc.) is an RNA aptamer in clinical development to  reverse the anticoagulant effect of the parenteral factor IXa inhibitor  pegnivacogin, which is also in development. This anticoagulant-antidote pair may provide an alternative in situations in which a fast onset and offset of  anticoagulation is needed, like in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with  extracorporeal circulation, as an alternative to the heparin/protamine pair.  ,  Context: considered clinically relevant (GMR, 113.94%; 90% CI, 99.33-130.70).

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"According to the provided context, U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by employing bifunctional oligonucleotides called U1 Adaptors.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that:  The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR and NMBR) is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin. However, there is no explicit information suggesting that these receptors are frequently overexpressed in lung cancers.  Therefore, a cautious answer would be:  ""I'm uncertain about the frequency of GRPR and NMBR overexpression in lung cancers based on the provided context."""," Context: their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However,  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,"According to the given context, mutational biases due to directional mutation pressure are introduced between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C)."," Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context: When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is  expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Thus, directional mutation pressure (GC/AT pressure) refers to mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).","8411203, 8433382, 20838599, 7932780, 2253708, 1556753, 7723058, 2326195, 3454289, 1978331, 3357886"
Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"Based on the provided context, the genes associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) are:  * DNM2 (dynamin 2): causes dominant intermediate CMT type B * GARS (glycyl-tRNA synthetase): causes dHMN-V and CMT2D  These genes are mentioned in the provided context as being associated with autosomal dominant inheritance of CMT."," Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance.

One subtype, dHMN type V (dHMN-V), is transmitted by  autosomal dominant inheritance and predominantly involves the hands. It is  allelic with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2D (CMT2D), in which a similar phenotype is associated with sensory signs. Missense mutations in the  glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with  either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"According to the given context, the aim of iodine prophylaxis is to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after an accident with a nuclear reactor. This aims to reduce the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer, particularly in foetuses and children under 18 years old."," Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three.

However, if you could provide more context or clarify which study or research paper you are referring to, I would be happy to help you find the answer."," Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"According to the provided context, the CRSP/ Med complex contains the following subunits:  * Med220 * Med70  Additionally, it is mentioned that different activators bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/ Med complex."," Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"According to the provided context, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity is linked to stress granule (SG) biogenesis. Specifically, it is mentioned that ""Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis."""," Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults.

Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context:  The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that PAPOLA/PAP is involved in regulating gene expression through translational regulation. The 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA contains two highly conserved uORFs, which affect the translation efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence. This suggests that PAPOLA/PAP plays a role in controlling the expression of its own protein and possibly other genes."," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: mRNA poly(A) tails affect translation, mRNA export and mRNA stability, with  translation initiation involving a direct interaction between eIF4G and the  poly(A)-binding protein Pab1. The latter factor contains four RNA recognition  motifs followed by a C-terminal region composed of a linker and a PABC domain.  We show here that yeast mutants lacking the C-terminal domains of Pab1 display  specific synthetic interactions with mutants in the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway.  Moreover, these mutations impair mRNA decay in vivo without significantly  affecting mRNA export or translation. Inhibition of mRNA decay occurs through  slowed deadenylation. In vitro analyses demonstrate that removal of the Pab1 linker domain directly interferes with the ability of the Pop2-Ccr4 complex to  deadenylate the Pab1-bound poly(A). Binding assays demonstrate that this results  from a modulation of poly(A) packaging by the Pab1 linker region. Overall, our results demonstrate a direct involvement of Pab1 in mRNA decay and reveal the  modular nature of this factor, with different domains affecting various cellular  processes. These data suggest new models involving the modulation of poly(A)  ,  Context: immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in  clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area  of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues  remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of  exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of  other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will  focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their  mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter  issue.  ,  Context: all exosome subunits are active exoribonucleases. Despite all data obtained on  the structure and function of the exosome during the last decade, there are  still a lot of unanswered questions. What is the molecular mechanism by which  cofactors select and target substrate RNAs to the exosome and modulate its  function for correct processing or degradation? How can the exosome discriminate  between processing or degradation of a specific substrate RNA? What is the  precise structure of exosome subunits and how do they contribute to its  function? Here we discuss studies that provide some insight to these questions  and speculate on the mechanisms that control the exosome.  ,  Context: following questions: What is the best administration schedule of decitabine in  solid tumors? Is there tumor type specificity for decitabine-based epigenetic  therapy? What are the biological function and mechanism of decitabine in  suppressing tumor development?

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,"According to the given context, SCUBE2 loss-of-function (SCUBE2 -/-) causes defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures."," Context: zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle.

In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In  addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.

Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: Protecting replication fork integrity during DNA replication is essential for  maintaining genome stability. Here, we report that SDE2, a PCNA-associated  protein, plays a key role in maintaining active replication and counteracting  replication stress by regulating the replication fork protection complex (FPC).  SDE2 directly interacts with the FPC component TIMELESS (TIM) and enhances its  stability, thereby aiding TIM localization to replication forks and the  coordination of replisome progression. Like TIM deficiency, knockdown of SDE2  leads to impaired fork progression and stalled fork recovery, along with a  failure to activate CHK1 phosphorylation. Moreover, loss of SDE2 or TIM results in an excessive MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks. Together, our  study uncovers an essential role for SDE2 in maintaining genomic integrity by  stabilizing the FPC and describes a new role for TIM in protecting stalled replication forks. We propose that TIM-mediated fork protection may represent a  way to cooperate with BRCA-dependent fork stabilization.  ,  Context: 30-43 kDa* (p = 0.0001).

What is etarfolatide used for?,"According to the provided context, etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-based companion imaging agent in development for use as a diagnostic tool to identify patients whose tumors express folate receptor alpha (FRα). It is used to monitor FRα expression status throughout treatment and predict clinical outcomes."," Context: frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets  FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with  GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome  of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those  with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI  patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone  could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug.  ,  Context: Selective heart rate (HR) reduction by I(f)-channel inhibition is a recently  developed pharmacological principle in cardiovascular therapy. Among these newly  identified HR-lowering drugs, only ivabradine has now become approved for  clinical use. I(f)-channel inhibition mainly reduces HR, thereby improving  myocardial oxygen supply, energy balance, and cardiac function. Ivabradine was  well tolerated and revealed a good safety profile in the investigated study  populations. The guiding experimental and clinical results of I(f)-channel  inhibition were compared to those of beta-blockade as a HR reducing principle as  well as cornerstone of heart failure standard therapy. Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits  beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well. Therefore,  hemodynamic effects of ivabradine and its limitations in heart failure together with the biological impact of HR reduction will be considered in this context.  Because no clinical data with specific heart-rate-reducing agents are available  in heart failure patients until now, the prospective significance of  ,  Context: patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those  analysed in this study.

Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"Based on the provided context, 3D printing has been tested for constructing complex human tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, and nerves."," Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"According to the given context, the YLR228c gene product is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins. Therefore, the gene that is the paralog of yeast UPC2 is YLR228c."," Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context:  The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans.

Furthermore,  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,"According to the provided context, HEp-2 cells are laryngeal cancer cell lines."," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs.

To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation.

Therefore, based on this context information, it can be concluded that epist"," Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that AGY may have potential as an antidiuretic agent, as it was associated with lowered lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LMER) in patients taking it. However, without further information or studies, it is uncertain whether AGY can be used as a replacement therapy for antidiuretics."," Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified.

Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent.

The review presents the electrolyte  abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic. In this paper,  ,  Context: oxytocin activity.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Based on the provided context information, Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that can treat:  * Prostate cancer * Endometriosis- associated pain * Uterine leiomyomas (myomas)  These are the explicit details mentioned in the context."," Context: an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated  in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH  antagonist. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and  maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in  103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and  neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.  INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms  scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and  ,  Context: RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds,  respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During  treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three  months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: group.

CONCLUSIONS: BBCAnalyzer provides a unique, novel approach to facilitate variant  calling where classical tools frequently fail to call. The R package is freely  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context: reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its  measurable perceptual consequences. However, while several research groups now  study synesthesia, there is no single protocol for comparing, contrasting and  pooling synesthetic subjects across these groups. There is no standard battery  of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions.  Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy  this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of  tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a  questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers.  Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We  introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests.

Olaratumab (LY3012207/IMC-3G3) is a human mAb that exclusively  binds to PDGFRα and recently received accelerated FDA approval and conditional  EMA approval for treatment of advanced adult sarcoma patients in combination  with doxorubicin. In this study, we investigated olaratumab in preclinical  models of pediatric bone and soft tissue tumors.Experimental Design: PDGFRα  expression was evaluated by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Olaratumab was investigated in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays using pediatric  osteosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines. In vivo activity of olaratumab was  assessed in preclinical mouse models of pediatric osteosarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor.Results:In vitro olaratumab treatment of osteosarcoma and  rhabdoid tumor cell lines reduced proliferation and inhibited invasion driven by  individual platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) or serum.

The novel findings in this instance are of foot anomalies including  camptodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd to 4th toes, which have not been previously described in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.  ,  Context: Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with  severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West  syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and  nonsyndromic epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we  identified a novel single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT  (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of the STXBP1 gene. This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with neonatal-onset focal seizures broadens the spectrum  of clinically relevant human disorders caused by STXBP1 mutations.  ,  Context: neutron-irradiated cells exhibited longer comet tails consisting of tiny pieces  of broken DNA in contrast to the streaking tails generated by (60)Co gamma. The  peak biological effectiveness occurred at 0.37 and 0.57 MeV; a further increase  or decrease in neutron energy led to a reduced RBE value.

Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atemoya (Annona atemoya) is increasingly being  consumed worldwide because of its pleasant taste. However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: involving the skin).

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"Based on the provided context, the main functions of human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts are:  * Regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) and U-rich elements (UREs) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. * Maintains expression of genes enriched in AREs and UREs in the 3'-UTR.  These functions are mentioned in the context as part"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation.

These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes.

In mouse embryonic  ,  Context: Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. This is mentioned in several studies, including those that suggest DNA sequence patterns can facilitate or inhibit nucleosome formation."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome?

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,"According to the given context, the TLR7 gene is located on the X chromosome."," Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration).

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"According to the given context, the ligand of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors is the Slit protein family."," Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates.

These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: while limiting their peripheral toxicity. Such molecular vectors can pave the  way for the development of new classes of therapeutics, fighting against  protagonists of neoplastic development. In line with this concept, peptide  ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a  strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been  developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3)  receptors.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis.

Additionally, the study found that saracatinib inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-87 cells, indicating its potential as an anti-cancer agent"," Context: types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been  identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and  targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We  evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib  (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell  lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines,  saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis.

Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted  synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These  data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the cross-talk and mediation of  many signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion,  migration, and tumorigenesis.

Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"According to the provided context, Waardenburg's syndrome and Horner's syndrome are recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia."," Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context:  Waardenburg's syndrome consists of lateral displacement of the inner canthi of  the eyes (dystopia canthorum), a broad nasal root and confluent eyebrows,  heterochromia iridum, a white forelock and congenital deafness.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that thyronamines have an effect on fat tissue. Specifically, it is mentioned that ""The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001)"" and that there was a ""marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice."""," Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice.

Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,"According to the provided context, the event that results in the acetylation of S6K1 is growth factor stimulation."," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.  ,  Context: S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues.

The inhibition of arginase-1 occurred at  the transcriptional level with the inhibition of polymerase II binding to the  promoter. IL-4 induced STAT6 phosphorylation and binding to DNA. These  activities were not affected by TSA treatment. However, TSA inhibited C/EBPβ DNA  binding. This inhibitor induced acetylation on lysine residues 215-216, which  are critical for DNA binding. Finally, using macrophages from STAT6 KO mice we  showed that STAT6 is required for the DNA binding of C/EBPβ. These results  demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. These  findings also provide a molecular mechanism to explain the control of gene  expression through deacetylase activity.  ,  Context: induced upon growth factor stimulation.

The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"Based on the provided context, the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are:  * mTOR * Rictor * mLST8/GβL * Sin1 * Protor-1 and/or Protor-2  These components interact with each other to form mTORC2."," Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2.

This kinase, which is part of two protein complexes termed mTOR  complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), has a fundamental role in coordinating  anabolic and catabolic processes in response to growth factors and nutrients. Of  the two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 is by far the best characterized. When active, mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context:  Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.  However, the mechanism by which they are recognized and targeted to the exosome  is not fully understood. Here we report that the MTREC complex, which has recently been shown to promote degradation of meiotic mRNAs and regulatory  ncRNAs, is also the major nuclear exosome targeting complex for CUTs and  unspliced pre-mRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets  these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has  only a minor role in this process. The MTREC complex physically interacts with  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  ","24331524, 17461779, 23641065, 21871173, 25989903, 23049074","Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a kinase complex comprised of mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, mLST8/GβL and PRR5.","24077282, 24244675, 22678916, 23049074, 22595285, 22773877, 23673367, 23455608, 22532249, 22820188"

The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of  thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent  glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.

Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.  ,  Context: Ospemifene (Osphena™) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),  with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.

Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively  regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns  using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that  these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that  MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different  subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different  functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and  localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires  VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also  function as positive regulators of biological processes.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: organism.

Edema can cause obstruction of the upper airway,  which may lead to suffocation. Prompt elimination of edema is necessary to save  patients from this life-threatening condition.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"According to the provided context, Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development by regulating transcription through connecting enhancers to promoters. It also defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.  As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"According to the given context, yes, colistin is an antibiotic. It is mentioned as one of the ""membrane-acting agents"" and also as a possible effective drug candidate for treating antibiotic-resistant UTIs. Additionally, it is used in combination with chloramphenicol to have synergistic activity against certain pathogens."," Context: norfloxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, ciprofloxacin), 15 beta-lactam or  cephalosporin antibiotics (cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam,  cefdinir, cefoperazone, cefpiramide, cefamandole, cefixime, ceftibuten,  cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of  Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira  guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus  callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are  presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of  microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our  knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.  ,  Context:  Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of emergency and office visits. This  article reviews causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The  incidence of antibiotic-associated colitis is increasing worldwide as a consequence of widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for various  illnesses. The pathogenic organism, Clostridium difficile, produces two  enterotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal inflammation. C. difficile infection presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from  asymptomatic carriers to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in  the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin).
