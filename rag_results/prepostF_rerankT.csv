HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"According to the given context, Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, defining super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context: transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. ,  Context: As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity. ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain ,  Context: function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles. ,  Context: Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA ,  Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and ","24998386, 24998386, 31209209, 27773677, 29209056, 24998386","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.","29209056, 26240385, 24824069, 27773677, 28575439, 27742736, 24998386, 33176147, 31209209, 31211995, 29157917"
Is colistin an antibiotic?,"According to the given context, yes, colistin is an antibiotic. It was mentioned as one of the top 7 hits among inhibitors (amikacin) and also appeared in combination with chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens."," Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against ,  Context: knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis. ,  Context: Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of emergency and office visits. This  article reviews causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The  incidence of antibiotic-associated colitis is increasing worldwide as a ,  Context: in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was ,  Context: the literature.
