What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in human diseases. Unlike genetic  mutations, however, they do not change the underlying DNA sequences. Epigenetic  phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with  many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the  methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput  screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a  miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for  methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it  ,  Context: was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations  that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent  mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1  (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly  affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich  repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone  methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for  histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in  multiple cohorts of HCC.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"STAG1/STAG2 proteins do not have a direct role in differentiation mentioned in the given context. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation, suggesting an indirect effect on cellular processes"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context:  Heat shock proteins are involved in cellular repair and protective mechanisms  that counter characteristic features of neurodegenerative diseases such as  protein misfolding and aggregation. The HSPA (Hsp70) multigene family includes the widely studied HSPA1A (Hsp70-1) and the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B') which  is present in the human genome and not in mouse and rat. The effect of knockdown  of HSPA6 and HSPA1A expression was examined in relation to the ability of differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to tolerate thermal stress. Low dose  co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, which induces Hsps, enhanced the  ability of differentiated neurons to survive heat shock. Small interfering RNA  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context:  The cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases (caspases) have been identified as  key players in the cellular process termed programmed cell death or apoptosis.  During apoptosis, activated apoptotic caspases cleave selected target proteins to execute cell death. Additionally to their established function in cell death,  a variety of recent publications have provided increasing evidence that  apoptotic caspases also participate in several non-apoptotic cellular processes. Activated caspases exhibit functions during T-cell proliferation and cell cycle  regulation, but are also involved in the differentiation of a diverse array of  cell types. In some cell types, their differentiation can be morphologically  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Dental mesenchymal stem cells (dMSCs) might differentiate into  odontoblast-like cells and form mineralized nodules. In the current study, we  investigated the effects of senescence on odontogenic differentiation of dMSCs.  METHODS: dMSCs were serially subcultured until senescence. Telomere lengths and  telomerase activities were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, eg, Bmi-1, p16(INK4A), osteocalcin (OC), dentin sialoprotein (DSP), bone  sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1) were assayed by Western  blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exogenous Bmi-1 was expressed in dMSCs by using retroviral vectors. Odontogenic  differentiation was assayed by alkaline phosphatase activity. RESULTS: Subculture-induced replicative senescence of dMSCs led to reduced  ","28430577, 19783418, 29090408, 2702688, 14555221, 21496667",STAG1/STAG2 proteins are tumour suppressor proteins that suppress cell proliferation and are essential for differentiation.,"26997282, 21589869, 19822671, 29867216, 15361841, 28430577, 27298259, 12034751, 18276799"
What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"For glioblastoma, a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 was found, with >10-year latency HR = 1.3. In the highest tertile (>426 h) of cumulative use, HR = 1."," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: This paper reviews the results of early cellphone studies, where exposure  duration was too short to expect tumorigenesis, as well as two sets of more  recent studies with longer exposure duration: the Interphone studies and the  Swedish studies led by Dr. Lennart Hardell. The recent studies reach very  different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone  studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the  Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: The use of cellular telephones has increased dramatically during the 1990's in  the world. In the 1980's the analogue NMT system was used whereas the digital  GSM system was introduced in early 1990's and is now the preferred system. Case  reports of brain tumours in users initiated this case-control study on brain  tumours and use of cellular telephones. Also other exposures were assessed. All  cases, both males and females, with histopathologically verified brain tumour living in Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-96) and Stockholm region (1995-96) aged  20-80 at the time of diagnosis and alive at start of the study were included,  233 in total. Two controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register matched for sex, age and study region. Exposure was assessed  by questionnaires supplemented over the phone. The analyses were based on  answers from 209 (90%) cases and 425 (91%) controls. Use of cellular telephone  ,  Context: from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is applicable for characterizing diverse regulatory architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide transcription start sites (TSSs), without relying on known promoter elements. It can be used to identify novel architectures"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome.  ,  Context: tissues; 2) selective ER degraders (SERD), compounds that induce a  conformational change in the receptor that targets it for proteasomal  degradation; and 3) tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSEC), drugs in which a  SERM and an ER agonist are combined to yield a blended activity that results in  distinct clinical profiles. In this study, we have performed a comprehensive  head-to-head analysis of the transcriptional activity of these different classes  of ERM in a cellular model of breast cancer. Not surprisingly, these studies  highlighted important functional differences and similarities among the existing  SERM, selective ER degraders, and TSEC. Of particular importance was the identification of genes that were regulated by various TSEC combinations but not  by an estrogen or SERM alone. Cumulatively, the findings of this analysis are  informative with respect to the mechanisms by which ER is engaged by different enhancers/promoters and highlights how promoter context influences the  pharmacological activity of ER ligands.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context:  Genomic data and annotations are rapidly accumulating in databases such as the  UCSC Genome Browser, NCBI, and Ensembl. Given the massive scale of these genomic  databases, it is important to be able to easily retrieve known data and annotations of a specified genomic locus. For example, for a newly identified  cis-regulatory element bound by a transcription factor, questions that  immediately come to mind include whether the element is near a transcriptional start site and, if so, the name of the corresponding gene, and whether the  histones or DNA at the locus are modified. The UCSC Genome Browser organizes  data and annotations (called tracks) around the reference sequences or draft  ,  Context: of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's  computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising  direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is  Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is  the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of  genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions. Preliminary assessment  of the investigational Oncomine Dx Target Test suggests it could facilitate  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling. In this review, 14 multigene assays are evaluated as to  their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval  status, and estimated cost-benefit ratio. Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: Recently, recommendations for the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen  receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into  guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National  Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which  measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of  disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond  to chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004  and has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora  M. Hansen, and Barbara Susnik answered questions regarding the incorporation of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay into routine clinical practice. This expert  dialog offers an update and clinical insights into when, how, and why clinicians  might incorporate the Oncotype DX assay into the management of their breast cancer patients. Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX  assay in node-positive patients is discussed. Finally, sample case studies offer  clinically relevant examples of the practical application of the Oncotype DX  assay.  ,  Context: have been characterized. These subtypes include the basal, the ERBB2+, and the  luminal A, B and C subtypes. The importance of these different subtypes lies in  the fact that they differ in clinical outcome, with the basal and ERBB2+  subtypes having the worst prognosis and the luminal A group having the best  prognosis. However, identification of these subtypes is still not clinically  used. Other strategies for evaluating tumors in a clinical setting have been  developed using smaller sets of genes. One such strategy is the 21-gene assay  (Oncotype DX), which is currently in commercial use in the USA. One advantage of  this test is the use of paraffin-embedded blocks instead of previous methods, which required fresh frozen tissue. Oncotype DX has been shown to predict  10-year distant recurrence in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, axillary  lymph node-negative breast cancer. This genomic assay has also been shown to predict chemotherapy and endocrine therapy response. Large, prospective,  randomized clinical trials are currently underway using this genomic test.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease (LBD) is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context:  It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some  manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types  within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the  form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive  neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label  Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic  boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the  ,  Context: Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the defining neuropathological characteristics  of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. They are made of abnormal  filamentous assemblies of unknown composition. We show here that Lewy bodies and  Lewy neurites from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are stained  strongly by antibodies directed against amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal  sequences of alpha-synuclein, showing the presence of full-length or close to full-length alpha-synuclein. The number of alpha-synuclein-stained structures  exceeded that immunoreactive for ubiquitin, which is currently the most  sensitive marker of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Staining for alpha-synuclein thus will replace staining for ubiquitin as the preferred method for detecting  Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB), Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)."," Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: There is a growing number of patients with sleep-disordered  breathing (SDB) referred to sleep clinics. Therefore, a simple but useful  screening tool is urgent. The NoSAS score, containing only five items, has been  developed and validated in population-based studies. AIM: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score for the screening of SDB  patients from a sleep clinic in China, and to compare the predictive value of  the NoSAS score with the STOP-Bang questionnaire. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients from a sleep clinic who had undergone  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) testing by type III portable monitor device at the hospital and completed the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score was assessed  by reviewing medical records. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive  value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different  AHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening. RESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were  ,  Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Pufferfish, specifically the smooth-backed blowfish Lagocephalus inermis, is associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX). Additionally, bacteria such as Raoultella terrigena are also known to produce TTX."," Context:  Marine pufferfish generally contain a large amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in  their skin and viscera, and have caused many incidences of food poisoning,  especially in Japan. Edible species and body tissues of pufferfish, as well as their allowable fishing areas, are therefore clearly stipulated in Japan, but  still 2 to 3 people die every year due to pufferfish poisoning. TTX is  originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria. Pufferfish become nontoxic when  fed TTX-free diets in a closed environment in which there is no possible  invasion of TTX-bearing organisms. On the other hand, TTX poisoning due to  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context: Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins,  tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development. Adults  of some species may be insensitive to toxins but early stages are more prone to  intoxication because they lack effective enzymatic systems to detoxify the  ,  Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Food poisoning due to ingestion of a puffer fish occurred in Nagasaki  Prefecture, Japan, in October 2008, causing neurotoxic symptoms similar to those  of tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning. In the present study, we identified the species, toxicity, and toxins using the remaining samples of the causative  puffer fish. The puffer fish was identified as smooth-backed blowfish  Lagocephalus inermis by nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and cytochrome b gene fragments of muscle mitochondrial DNA.

Similar tumours that do not secrete active substances of any kind are called non  functioning paragangliomas. The hallmark clinical manifestation of  pheochromocytoma is hypertension accompanied with various signs and symptoms in  excess of catecholamines or other bioactive substances. The early diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is important not only because it offers the possibility of  curing hypertension but also because unrecognised pheochromocytoma is a  potentially lethal condition.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context: local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA  sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts  the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial  mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population,  which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are  distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be  delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking  effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on  genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in  subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high  migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.  ,  Context:  Selective sweeps leave distinct signatures locally in genomes, enabling the  detection of loci that have undergone recent positive selection. Multiple  signatures of a selective sweep are known, yet each neutrality test only identifies a single signature. We present RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep  Detection), an open-source software that implements a novel, to our knowledge,  and parameter-free detection mechanism that relies on multiple signatures of a selective sweep via the enumeration of SNP vectors.

List markers for autophagy.,"ATG16L, cathepsins, ATG5, LC3II."," Context: (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins  contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  monitoring autophagy, including the use of GFP-LC3 and GFP-Atg5, are discussed.  ,  Context: Functional intracellular Ca(2+) signaling is essential for the upregulation of  the canonical mTOR-controlled autophagy pathway triggered by rapamycin or by  nutrient deprivation. Moreover, modifications in the Ca(2+)-signaling machinery  coincide with autophagy stimulation. This results in enhanced intracellular  Ca(2+) signaling essential for driving the autophagy process. Yet, the  mechanisms upstream (the players causing the changes in Ca(2+) signaling) and downstream (the targets of the altered Ca(2+) signals) of this Ca(2+)-dependent  autophagy pathway remain elusive. Here, we speculate about these mechanisms  based on our current knowledge.  ,  Context: analysis (GSEA) revealed ""stemness,"" inflammation, DNA damage, aging, oxidative  stress, hypoxia, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the tumor stroma of  patients lacking stromal Cav-1. Our findings are consistent with the recently  proposed ""Reverse Warburg Effect"" and the ""Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of  Cancer Metabolism."" In these two complementary models, cancer cells induce  oxidative stress in adjacent stromal cells, which then forces these stromal  fibroblasts to undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis. This, in  turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones and glutamine) to feed  anabolic cancer cells, which are undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Our results are also consistent with previous biomarker studies showing that the  increased expression of known autophagy markers (such as ATG16L and the  cathepsins) in the tumor stroma is specifically associated with metastatic tumor progression and/or poor clinical outcome.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Autophagy induction can increase or decrease anticancer drug  efficacy. Anticancer drug-induced autophagy induction is poorly characterized in  osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on camptothecin (CPT)-induced cytotoxicity in OS.

Knockdown of ATG5 protein expression and inhibition of  autophagy was confirmed by immunoblot of ATG5 and LC3II proteins, respectively.  Metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay and cell viability was determined  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests  that impairment of lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in  alpha-synuclein clearance might play an important role. For this reason, we  sought to examine the expression levels of members of the autophagy pathway in brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in alpha-synuclein  transgenic mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By immunoblot analysis, compared to controls and AD, in DLB cases levels of mTor were elevated and Atg7 were reduced. Levels of  other components of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5, Atg10, Atg12 and  Beclin-1 were not different in DLB compared to controls. In DLB brains, mTor was  ,  Context: AIMS: On the basis of our previous reports that cardioprotection induced by  ischaemic preconditioning induces autophagy and that resveratrol, a polyphenolic  antioxidant present in grapes and red wine induces preconditioning-like effects,  we sought to determine if resveratrol could induce autophagy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Resveratrol at lower doses (0.1 and 1 microM in H9c2  cardiac myoblast cells and 2.5 mg/kg/day in rats) induced cardiac autophagy  shown by enhanced formation of autophagosomes and its component LC3-II after  hypoxia-reoxygenation or ischaemia-reperfusion. The autophagy was attenuated  with the higher dose of resveratrol. The induction of autophagy was correlated with enhanced cell survival and decreased apoptosis. Treatment with rapamycin  (100 nM), a known inducer of autophagy, did not further increase autophagy  compared with resveratrol alone. Autophagic inhibitors, wortmannin (2 microM) and 3-methyladenine (10 mM), significantly attenuated the resveratrol-induced  autophagy and induced cell death.

Here, we established a novel method,  engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP),  for purification of specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions.  We showed that enChIP using the CRISPR system efficiently isolates specific  genomic regions. In this form of enChIP, specific genomic regions are immunoprecipitated with antibody against a tag(s), which is fused to a  catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9), which is co-expressed with a guide  RNA (gRNA) and recognizes endogenous DNA sequence in the genomic regions of interest. enChIP-mass spectrometry (enChIP-MS) targeting endogenous loci  identified associated proteins. enChIP using the CRISPR system would be a  convenient and useful tool for dissecting chromatin structure of genomic regions  of interest.  ,  Context: The motivation of this research is to establish a system of target genomic DNA  capture and enrichment, which could be used in deep sequencing of target regions  with next-generation sequencing.

We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: Recent studies have revealed that, in addition to hormones and other protein  factors, noncoding RNA molecules play an important regulatory role in milk  protein synthesis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are universally expressed noncoding  RNA species that have been proposed recently to regulate the expression of their  parental genes. In the present study, the deep RNA-sequencing technique known as  RNA-seq was used to compare expression profiles of circRNAs from 2 pooled RNA  samples from cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum and to identify the  key circRNAs involved in lactation. A total of 4,804 and 4,048 circRNAs were  identified in the cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum, respectively, of which only 2,231 circRNAs were co-expressed at both lactation stages, suggesting  high stage specificity in the circRNAs. The enrichment of some Gene Ontology  terms for the circRNA parental genes differed between lactation stages. Among the top 10 enriched Gene Ontology terms, vesicle, endoplasmic reticulum, and  mitochondrial lumen were more common on lactation d 90. All 4 casein-coding  genes (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3) produced circRNAs in the cattle mammary  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost  always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to  produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding  genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic  repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional  ,  Context: myogenesis and altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A high-content functional  genomic screen allowed the study of their functional role in muscle  differentiation. One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling  myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from  the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an  in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context: the mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7,  particularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of  endogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA,  sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that  miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.  This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a  naturally expressed circRNA.

What is the purpose of HaploReg v4?,HaploReg V4.1 is used to understand functional annotation on important single nucleotide variations (SNVs).," Context: More than 90% of common variants associated with complex traits do not affect  proteins directly, but instead the circuits that control gene expression. This  has increased the urgency of understanding the regulatory genome as a key  component for translating genetic results into mechanistic insights and  ultimately therapeutics. To address this challenge, we developed HaploReg  (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) to aid the functional dissection of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal  variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and  the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations. Since first launching the website in  2011, we have greatly expanded HaploReg, increasing the number of chromatin  state maps to 127 reference epigenomes from ENCODE 2012 and Roadmap Epigenomics,  ,  Context: Jiangsu Province and Jiangsu Province Hospital from 2003 to 2009. Controls were  randomly selected from individuals who visited the same hospital or a  community-based health examination program during the same time period. A 5 ml  venous blood sample was obtained from each participant and epidemiological  information was collected on a standard questionnaire. Illumina Infinium(®)  BeadChip was used for genotyping of 35 DNA damage-related single nucleotide  variations (SNVs), which were identified in our previous study. Multivariate and  binary logistic regressions were used to calculate the OR and 95%CI for lung  cancer risk.

Here we identify HAX-1 as a  regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity  in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium  kinetics and mechanics.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context: Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological,  immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape  viralphylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral  phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on  how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be  considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially  RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation  times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities  transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be  affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ  ,  Context: The 454 Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX System is one of the next-generation  sequencing systems featured by long reads, high accuracy, and ultra-high  throughput. Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would  only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS  FLX. However, biased amplification of DNA templates might occur in the process  of emulsion PCR, which results in production of artificial duplicate reads. Under the condition that each DNA template is unique to another, 3.49%-18.14% of  total reads in GS FLX-sequencing data were found to be artificial duplicate  reads. These duplicate reads may lead to misunderstanding of sequencing data and special attention should be paid to the potential biases they introduced to the  data.  ,  Context:  Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging  disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced  ""progerin"" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression  changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown  that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of  stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA  sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also  ,  Context: underlying these effects have remained largely unknown. To investigate this, we  first show that R-loop formation induces chromosomal DNA rearrangements and  recombination in Escherichia coli, just as it does in eukaryotes. More  importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork  stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic  stability. Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly  suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells.  Our findings thus provide a direct demonstration that R-loop formation impairs  DNA replication and that this is responsible for the deleterious effects of R loops on genome stability from bacteria to humans.  ,  Context: do not activate cathepsin L-mediated degradation of 53BP1 and maintain  expression of BRCA1 and RAD51. Accordingly, Lmna(Δ9/Δ9) MEFs do not present  genomic instability, and expression of mutant lamin A Δexon9 in lamin-depleted  cells restores DNA repair factors levels and partially rescues nuclear  abnormalities. These data reveal that the domain encoded by exon 9 is important  to maintain telomere homeostasis and heterochromatin structure but does not play  a role in DNA repair, thus pointing to other exons in the lamin A tail as  responsible for the genomic instability phenotype in Lmna(Δ8-11/Δ8-11) mice. Our  study also suggests that the levels of DNA repair factors 53BP1, BRCA1 and RAD51 could potentially serve as biomarkers to identify laminopathies that present  with genomic instability.

On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes.

We also demonstrate that, mimicking TGF-beta  effects, ectopic overexpression of TIEG is sufficient to trigger the apoptotic cell program in these cells, which is preceded by a decrease of Bcl-2 protein  levels.

Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have  not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the  activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and  c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period  of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy  pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers,  where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in  layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the ""border strips"" of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (>5 h),  the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured,  changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy pattern of the expression in the infragranular and supragranular layers  remained.

Hemophilic pseudotumor results  from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones or soft tissue spaces. It is  uncommon and is seen in severe cases of hemophilia only 1-2% of the time.  Complications and symptoms arise due to pain and/or compression of surrounding  structures. Pathologic fractures can be associated with intraosseous lesions and  can result from bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of an  osseous hemorrhage. Radiographs may demonstrate expansile lesions of the bones  or increased soft tissue density that may be associated with extra osseous  lesions. Bleeding may also occur within the joint space. These intra-articular hemorrhages can, over time, result in hemophilic arthropathy.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconic eyes and cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

Recently, it has reported that mCAPIRI is well tolerated and  non-inferior to FOLFIRI. In this study, we conducted a multicenter phase II  trial to assess the efficacy and safety of biweekly CAPIRI plus bevacizumab as  second-line chemotherapy for mCRC with reduced toxicity and preserved efficacy. METHODS: Patients with mCRC who had received prior chemotherapy, including  oxaliplatin-based regimens, were eligible for this study. The treatment protocol administered capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 twice daily from the evening of day 1 to  the morning of day 8, intravenous irinotecan at 150 mg/m2 on day 1, and  bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg on day 1 every 2 weeks. Primary endpoints for this study were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Secondary endpoints were  overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure, response rate (RR), and  disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study.

However, there have been no reports regarding the optimal dose of prednisolone  (PSL) for treatment of SAT. In this study, we used 15 mg/day of PSL as the  initial dosage and tapered it by 5 mg every 2 weeks. We assessed the  effectiveness of this treatment protocol. METHODS: We examined 384 consecutive and untreated patients with SAT who visited  our thyroid clinic between February 2005 and December 2008. We excluded patients  who did not fit our protocol, and the final number of subjects was 219. When patients complained of pain in their neck or C-reactive protein (CRP) was still  high, physicians were able to extend the tapering of the dose of PSL or increase  it at 2-week intervals.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. Additionally, mTORC1 regulates STAT3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of"," Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling  critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling  was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3  signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance. We conclude that the  upregulation of Notch1 expression by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is an essential event in the development of hepatic insulin resistance in the presence  of excess amino acids. Activation of AMPK prevents amino acid-induced insulin  resistance through the suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling pathway.  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant  disorder characterized by widespread benign tumor formation in a variety of  organs. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible  for TSC. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin,  respectively, form a physical and functional complex and inhibit the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth promoting pathway. mTORC1 plays an essential  role in a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription,  trafficking and autophagy.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: Headaches complicating lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement have been attributed  to shunt failure with resultant high intracranial pressure or to overdrainage  with resultant low intracranial pressure. In this case, a 17-yr-old girl had  symptoms of a low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement alleviated by an  epidural blood patch. The success of this therapy suggests postdural puncture as  a possible cause for low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement. Epidural  blood patch may be an alternative initial therapy for some low-pressure  headaches after LP shunt placement.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible.

We retrieved posts from the /r/covidlonghaulers subreddit and extracted  symptoms via approximate matching using an expanded meta-lexicon. We mapped the  extracted symptoms to standard concept IDs, compared their distributions with  those reported in recent literature and analyzed their distributions over time. From 42 995 posts by 4249 users, we identified 1744 users who expressed at least  1 symptom. The most frequently reported long-COVID symptoms were mental  health-related symptoms (55.2%), fatigue (51.2%), general ache/pain (48.4%), brain fog/confusion (32.8%), and dyspnea (28.9%) among users reporting at least  1 symptom.

This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins.

By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Zebrafish embryos are transcriptionally silent until activation of  the zygotic genome during the 10th cell cycle. Onset of transcription is  followed by cellular and morphological changes involving cell speciation and gastrulation. Previous genome-wide surveys of transcriptional changes only  assessed gene expression levels; however, recent studies have shown the  necessity to map isoform-specific transcriptional changes. Here, we perform isoform discovery and quantification on transcriptome sequences from before and  after zebrafish zygotic genome activation (ZGA). RESULTS: We identify novel isoforms and isoform switches during ZGA for genes  ,  Context: characterized by chromosomal translocations that generate fusions between the  EWS gene and ETS-family transcription factors, most commonly FLI1. The EWS-FLI1  fusion oncoprotein represents an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of  Ewing's sarcoma. The cell of origin of ESFT and the molecular mechanisms by  which EWS-FLI1 mediates tumorigenesis remain unknown, and few animal models of  Ewing's sarcoma exist. Here, we report the use of zebrafish as a vertebrate  model of EWS-FLI1 function and tumorigenesis. Mosaic expression of the human  EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in zebrafish caused the development of tumors with  histology strongly resembling that of human Ewing's sarcoma. The incidence of tumors increased in a p53 mutant background, suggesting that the p53 pathway  suppresses EWS-FLI1-driven tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling of the  zebrafish tumors defined a set of genes that might be regulated by EWS-FLI1, including the zebrafish ortholog of a crucial EWS-FLI1 target gene in humans.  Stable zebrafish transgenic lines expressing EWS-FLI1 under the control of the  heat-shock promoter exhibit altered embryonic development and defective  ,  Context: Smyd5 in vivo, zebrafish were utilised as a model system. We first examined  smyd5 expression patterns in developing zebrafish embryos. Smyd5 transcripts  were abundantly expressed at early developmental stages and then gradually  decreased.

Embryos injected with smyd5-MO showed normal gross  morphological development, including of heart and skeletal muscle. However,  increased expression of both primitive and definitive hematopoietic markers,  including pu.1, mpx, l-plastin, and cmyb, were observed. These phenotypes of smyd5-MO zebrafish embryos were also observed when we introduced mutations in  smyd5 gene with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy.

Although demyelination represents a  characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the  degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and  impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of  life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological  abnormalities are already present in childhood. Here, we show in  Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early postnatal development, caused by imbalanced  activity of the PI3K-Akt and the Mek-Erk signaling pathways. We demonstrate that  enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling by axonally overexpressed neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type I drives diseased Schwann cells toward differentiation and preserves peripheral  nerve axons.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,Avapritinib selectively inhibits oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants by targeting the active conformation of the kinase.," Context: previous treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. Here we  show that ripretinib treatment in combination with MEK inhibitors is effective  at inducing and enhancing the apoptotic response and preventing growth of  resistant colonies in both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant GIST cell lines,  even after long-term removal of drugs. The effect was also observed in systemic  mastocytosis (SM) cells, wherein the primary drug-resistant KIT D816V is the  driver mutation. Our results show that the combination of KIT and MEK inhibition  has the potential to induce cytocidal responses in GIST and SM cells.  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth  factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these  mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in addition to the data currently available from early clinical studies as well as  those later-stage trials that led to its approval.  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context: Consequently, developing or identifying modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 that are  suitable for clinical practice is of great importance. Therefore, we have  explored the drug repositioning approach to identify candidate modulators of  ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological  properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that  avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine  kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor  receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and  ABCG2. Moreover, avapritinib restores the chemosensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. These findings  were further supported by results of apoptosis induction assays, ATP hydrolysis  assays, and docking of avapritinib in the drug-binding pockets of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Altogether, our study highlights an additional action of avapritinib on  ABC drug transporters, and a combination of avapritinib with conventional  chemotherapy should be further investigated in patients with MDR tumors.  ,  Context: (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 ), or exon 9 (UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ) mutations, respectively. We  compared avapritinib (10 and 30 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle, imatinib (50  mg/kg/bid) or regorafenib (30 mg/kg/once daily; UZLX-GIST9 KIT11+17 );  avapritinib (10, 30, 100 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle or imatinib  [UZLX-GIST3 KIT11 ]; and avapritinib (10, 30, 60 mg/kg/once daily) versus  vehicle, imatinib (50, 100 mg/kg/twice daily), or sunitinib (40 mg/kg/once  daily; UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ).  RESULTS: In all models, avapritinib resulted in reduction of tumor volume,  significant inhibition of proliferation, and reduced KIT signaling. In two  models, avapritinib led to remarkable histologic responses, increase in apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation. Avapritinib showed superior  (UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 and -GIST2B KIT 9 ) or equal (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 )  antitumor activity to the standard dose of imatinib. In UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 , the antitumor effects of avapritinib were significantly better than with  imatinib or regorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Avapritinib has significant antitumor activity in GIST PDX models  ,  Context: In a phase I trial of avapritinib (formerly BLU-285), which targets D816V mutant  KIT, for the treatment of advanced systemic mastocytosis, patients experienced  rapid and durable disease control.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges. They also play a crucial role in fine"," Context: ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing  reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs  in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular  RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being  associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with  individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context: critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these  studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and  congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their  critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological  conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes,  vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. This review  summarizes the role of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in cardiac  development, congenital heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy, and vascular  endothelial cell survival. Although the clinical relevance of SWI/SNF mutations has traditionally been focused primarily on their role in tumor suppression,  these recent studies illustrate their critical role in the heart whereby they  regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of cardiac derived  cell lines.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly stable forms of non-coding RNAs with diverse  biological functions. They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast  cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are used at various locations including Stanford, CA, USA (Linac Coherent Light Source - LCLS), Hamburg, Germany (Xray Free Electron LASER - XFEL)."," Context: fusion. Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure,  requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous  temperatures and densities. With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source  (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been  investigated. An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray  interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for  applications. Here we report the experimental creation of a solid-density plasma at temperatures in excess of 10(6) kelvin on inertial-confinement timescales  using an X-ray free-electron laser. We discuss the pertinent physics of the  intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a  radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental  results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution  ,  Context: of these complementary experimental approaches when seeking to understand  protein conformational dynamics. These methods are illustrated using a limited  set of examples including myoglobin and haemoglobin in complex with carbon  monoxide, the simple light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, and the  superoxide scavenger superoxide reductase. In conclusion, likely future  developments of these methods at synchrotron X-ray sources and the potential  impact of emerging X-ray free-electron laser facilities are speculated upon.  ,  Context: We live in an age of access to more information than ever before. This can be a  double-edged sword. Increased access to information allows for more informed and  empowered researchers, while information overload becomes an increasingly  serious risk. Thus, there is a need for intelligent information retrieval  systems that can summarize relevant and reliable textual sources to satisfy a  user's query. Question answering is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural  language questions. We present a review and comparison of three biomedical  question answering systems: askHERMES (http://www.askhermes.org/), EAGLi (http://eagl.unige.ch/EAGLi/), and HONQA  (http://services.hon.ch/cgi-bin/QA10/qa.pl).  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context:  The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  ,  Context: There are various in vitro LASER applications, however, the most important ones  include: Hybrid Coulter Principle-LASER Hematology Analyzers.

The relevant  industrial property milestone-documents and their overall numeral trends are  presented. In 1971, J. Madey invented and developed the Free Electron LASER  (FEL), a vacuum-tube that uses a beam of relativistic electrons passing through a periodic, transverse magnetic field (wiggler) to produce coherent radiation,  contained in an optical cavity defined by mirrors. A resonance condition that  involves the energy of the electron beam, the strength of the magnetic field, and the periodicity of the magnet determines the wavelength of the radiation.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain, involving forebrain and facial malformations that can range from mild to severe. It is also described as the most common malformation of the"," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of  ,  Context:  Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing  human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been  implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.

We show that DLL1 is co-expressed in the developing chick forebrain with Fgf8. By treating chick embryos with a pharmacological inhibitor, we  demonstrate that DLL1 interacts with FGF signaling pathway. Moreover, a mutation  analysis of DLL1 in HPE patients revealed a three-nucleotide deletion.

Based on evidence, the gut microbiota is associated with metabolic disorders  such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and neuropsychiatric disorders such as  schizophrenia, autistic disorders, anxiety disorders and major depressive  disorders. In the past few years, neuroscientific research has shown the importance of the microbiota in the development of brain systems. Recent studies  showed that the microbiota could activate the immune and central nervous  systems, including commensal and pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microorganisms are capable of producing and  delivering neuroactive substances such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid,  which act on the gut-brain axis.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 regulates T3 binding and cardiac myoblasts differentiation in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: similar to that in wild-type mice at room temperature. However, at  thermoneutrality, in which the regulation of heart rate switches from  sympathetic to parasympathetic in wild-type mice, TRalpha1+m mice maintained  sympathetic stimulation and failed to activate parasympathetic signaling. Our  findings demonstrate a novel role for TRalpha1 in the adaptation of cardiac  activity by the autonomic nervous system and suggest that human patients with a  similar mutation in TRalpha1 might exhibit a deficit in cardiac adaptation to  stress or physical activity and an increased sensitivity to beta-blockers.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: embryo. One new term is proposed: parapagus, from the Greek para, meaning  ""side,"" combined with pagus, meaning ""fixed""; this is the group formerly called  dicephalus or diprosopos. These anterolaterally united parapagus twins must  result from two nearly parallel notochords in close proximity; craniopagi and  pygopagi from fusion at the cranial and caudal neuropores, respectively;  cephalopagi and ischiopagi from union at the pharyngeal and cloacal membranes,  respectively; thoracopagi from merging of the cardiac anlage; and omphalopagi  from fusion of the umbilicus or of the edges of two embryonic discs in any area  not including the above sites. Parasitic twins result from embryonic death of one twin, leaving various portions of the body vascularized by the surviving  autosite. The rarity of cases (2) not easily explained by the above theories,  and the nearly 6% of twins with two umbilical cords arising from the placenta would seem to support these conclusions. Should one wish to learn the methods of  a conjurer, he might vainly watch the latter's customary repertoire, and, so  long as everything went smoothly, might never obtain a clue to the mysterious  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction. Recommended treatments for MIS-C include intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, and inotropic or vasopressor support.

RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentation of MIS-C is dominated by significant  inflammation. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension are common features. Kawasaki disease-like findings are common, but  epidemiologic data and recent mechanistic studies suggest that distinct  inflammatory pathways mediate Kawasaki disease and MIS-C. A broad diagnostic  ,  Context:  We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). This adolescent male  presented prior to any known association between COVID-19 and immune mediated inflammatory syndrome in children. He presented in stable condition and without  significant multisystem involvement. During hospitalization, he developed severe  left ventricular dysfunction and mixed hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic shock.

The condition  is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that  share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established at the Public Health Agency of Canada with COVID-19 literature was searched for  articles referencing MIS-C, PIMS or Kawasaki Disease in relation to COVID-19. RESULTS: : A total of 195 out of 988 articles were included in the review.

This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,"Yes, ubrogepant has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine medication."," Context: long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability.  RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to treatment. Four  cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases (one placebo, one  ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one (ubrogepant) probably related.  ,  Context: Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy™) is an orally administered, small molecule,  highly-selective, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that was  developed by Allergan under license to Merck & Co. as an acute treatment for  migraine. In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ubrogepant leading to its first global approval for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults.  ,  Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use. Overall, there was no evidence of  ,  Context: therapies that can be easily handled by patients (i.e. by oral administration). AREAS COVERED: This review reports on compounds currently under development for  the oral treatment of acute migraine attacks, focusing on  Calcitonin-Gene-Related-Peptide receptor antagonists, specifically ubrogepant  and rimegepant. This article is based on literature obtained from PubMed and  publicly available clinical trial data.  EXPERT OPINION: Both reviewed compounds meet the need for rapid and effective  pain control, combined with the control of associated bothersome symptoms while  also lacking significant adverse events and safety concerns. Though further studies should assess the profile of these compounds comparatively with existing  and available treatments (namely triptans), the currently available data points  to these new therapies as being very promising new symptomatic oral treatments of migraines.  ,  Context: Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been  submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context: cause highly lethal infections for which no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  licensed vaccines or therapies exist. Not only are there concerns that these  agents could be used by those with malicious intent, but shifts in ecological  distribution of viral reservoirs due to climate change or globalization could  lead to more frequent infections within remote regions than previously seen as  well as outbreaks in more populous areas. The current EBOV epidemic shows no  sign of abating across 3 West African nations (as of October 2014), including  densely populated areas, far outpacing infection rates of previous outbreaks. A  limited number of cases have also arisen in the United States and Europe. With few treatment options for these deadly viruses, development of animal models  reflective of human disease is paramount to combat these diseases. As an example  of this potential, a new treatment compound, ZMapp, that had demonstrated efficacy against EBOV infection in nonhuman primates (NHPs) received an  emergency compassionate use exception from the FDA for the treatment of 2  American medical workers infected with EBOV, and they are currently virus free  and recovering.  ,  Context: both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and  flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of  wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do  not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue  virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a  human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and  capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause  widespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential,  these viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because  some of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious,  special containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.  ,  Context:  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.  In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza appeared nearly simultaneously around the globe  and caused extraordinary mortality (an estimated 50-100 million deaths) associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The  descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they  cause significant mortality each year. Although the ability to predict influenza pandemics remains no better than it was a century ago, numerous scientific  advances provide an important head start in limiting severe disease and death  from both current and future influenza viruses: identification and substantial  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context: A common challenge in pathogen discovery by deep sequencing approaches is to  recognize viral or subviral pathogens in samples of diseased tissue that share  no significant homology with a known pathogen. Here we report a  homology-independent approach for discovering viroids, a distinct class of free  circular RNA subviral pathogens that encode no protein and are known to infect  plants only. Our approach involves analyzing the sequences of the total small RNAs of the infected plants obtained by deep sequencing with a unique  computational algorithm, progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR).  Viroid infection triggers production of viroid-derived overlapping siRNAs that cover the entire genome with high densities. PFOR retains viroid-specific siRNAs  for genome assembly by progressively eliminating nonoverlapping small RNAs and  those that overlap but cannot be assembled into a direct repeat RNA, which is  ,  Context: Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the deadliest form of malaria, and  human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are among the most important health  problems worldwide, being responsible for a total of 4 million deaths annually.  Due to their extensive overlap in developing regions, especially Sub-Saharan  Africa, co-infections with malaria and HIV-1 are common, but the interplay  between the two diseases is poorly understood. Epidemiological reports have suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and  increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals. Because this viremia  stays high for several weeks after treatment with antimalarials, this phenomenon could have an impact on disease progression and transmission. The cellular  immunological mechanisms behind these observations have been studied only  scarcely.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) cytokine receptors.," Context: of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta,  initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/  Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in  CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of  these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by  cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer  half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not  tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The initial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS  suggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet  to be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other chronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and  systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial  involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and  background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response  (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: severity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of  function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is  supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions.  Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug  Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome  and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for  longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in  disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept  in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept  is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring  weekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders  may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for  ","19649332, 33200890, 32324502, 32562029, 33229362, 22096352",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1), histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), and SIRT2. Additionally, MEC"," Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known.  Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6  promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated  deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show  ,  Context: α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes.  ,  Context: with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling. Microtubule composed  of tubulins regulates cell shape, migration and survival. Tubulin acetylation  has an important role in the control of microtubule structure and microtubule-based cellular functions. In this study, angiotensin II induced  disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment  with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using  RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin  II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method.  ,  Context:  Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the  ,  Context: The fact that histones are modified by acetylation has been known for almost 30  years. The recent identification of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation  has revealed a broader use of this modification than was suspected previously.  Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including  transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation  regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein  interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the  bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling  domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to  phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate  specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation with the process of phosphorylation.

If high elagolix doses are used to control severe pain for long periods of time,  add-back therapies should be added, similar to that prescribed when using GnRH  agonists. To date, the efficacy of elagolix has only been demonstrated in  placebo-controlled explanatory trials. Pragmatic trials comparing elagolix with  low-dose hormonal contraceptives and progestogens should be planned to verify  the magnitude of the incremental benefit, if any, of this GnRH antagonist over  currently used standard treatments. The price of elagolix may impact on patient  adherence and, hence, on clinical effectiveness. In the USA, the manufacturer AbbVie Inc. priced elagolix (OrilissaTM) at around $10 000 a year, i.e. $845 per  month. When faced with unaffordable treatments, some patients may choose to  forego care. If national healthcare systems are funded by the tax payer, the approval and the use of a new costly drug to treat a chronic condition, such as  endometriosis, means that some finite financial resources will be diverted from  other areas, or that similar patients will not receive the same level of care.  ,  Context: unprecedented speed to control potential pandemics or bioterrorism attacks.  Plant-host engineering provides a method for producing proteins with unique and  uniform mammalian post-translational modifications, providing opportunities to  develop biologics with increased efficacy relative to their mammalian  cell-produced counterparts. Recent demonstrations that plant-made proteins can  function as biocontrol agents of foodborne pathogens further exemplify the  potential utility of plant-based protein production.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have dual influences on tumorigenesis, but in most solid cancers, increased infiltration with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has been associated with poor patient prognosis. However, stimulating macrophage's pro-resolving functions"," Context: Macrophages are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and orchestrate  various aspects of immunity. Within tumors, macrophages can reversibly alter  their endotype in response to environmental cues, including hypoxia and stimuli  derived from other immune cells, as well as the extracellular matrix. Depending  on their activation status, macrophages can exert dual influences on  tumorigenesis by either antagonizing the cytotoxic activity immune cells or by  enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions. Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer  ,  Context: that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor  progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic approach could be envisioned in cancer therapy.  ,  Context: and are the standards against which new drugs are compared. Novel DNA synthesis  inhibitors for the treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies include a  combination of the antimetabolite TAS-102, which consists of trifluorothymidine  with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, and a novel micellar formulation of  cisplatin NC-6004 that uses a nanotechnology-based drug delivery system. The  challenges of translational cancer research using DNA synthesis inhibitors  include the identification of drugs that are specific to tumor cells to reduce  toxicity and increase antitumor efficacy, biomarkers to predict pharmacological  responses to chemotherapeutic drugs, identification of ways to overcome drug resistance and development of novel combination therapies with DNA synthesis  inhibitors and other cancer therapies, such as targeted molecular therapeutics.  Here, we discuss the current understanding of DNA synthesis inhibitors and their mechanisms of action for the treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies.  ,  Context: Exosomes are a subtype of vesicles released by cells of both healthy and  neoplastic origin. Preclinical studies suggest a role for tumour-derived  exosomes in tumour progression, mainly through the transfer of RNA and proteins  from tumour cells to other cells. The transfer of RNA and proteins by  tumour-derived exosomes seems to mediate stimulation of angiogenesis and  suppression of immune cells; in contrast, exosomes from healthy cells of the  immune system appear to have anti-tumour characteristics. Characterisation of  the RNA or protein profile of tumour-derived exosomes could have diagnostic or  prognostic value, for example, in brain tumours. Anti-tumour therapies could be based on exosomes, for example, by blocking the formation of tumour-derived  exosomes or having exosomes release therapeutic agents at specific sites. The  most advanced application of this is the use of exosomes from dendritic cells in tumour vaccination; the safety of this has been demonstrated in phase I studies.  ,  Context: most notably in multiple myeloma but also in other cancers, inflammatory  disease, and HIV. We also describe the laboratory studies that have led to the  characterization and development of SelCIDs and IMiDs into potentially  clinically relevant drugs. Early trial data suggest that these novel  immunomodulatory compounds may supercede thalidomide to become established  therapies, particularly in certain cancers. Further evidence is required,  however, to correlate the clinical efficacy of these compounds with their known  immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties.  ,  Context: relevant articles and snippets from PUBMED Central; produce ""exact"" and  paragraph-sized ""ideal"" answers (summaries).

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, GFI1B is essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality due to failure to produce definitive erythrocytes."," Context: Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to  ,  Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for  primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences  markers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b  silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for  ,  Context:  To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA treatment significantly  knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not  cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down  Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context:  Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of  transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Gfi1b-null embryos die at  midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice  that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid  specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full  gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to  adulthood. Both the embryonic deletion of Gfi1b by EpoR-Cre and the deletion in  ,  Context: In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1  and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an erythropoietin-independent manner.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles.," Context: epigenome, with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA  hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. However the  spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been  extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and  Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the  breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods  that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published  by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession GSE57498.  ,  Context: methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling  chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Therefore,  there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify  chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/.

The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically  accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting  the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a  placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold  multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly  unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in  these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust  methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people  with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of  interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional  lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external  validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality  of life).  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed  tomography angiography (CTA) and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan in the  assessment of pulmonary embolism (PE) by means of a Bayesian statistical model.

Genome-wide analysis of such polyadenylation signals was missing in fission  yeast, even though it is an important model organism. We demonstrate that the  canonical AATAAA motif is the most frequent and functional polyadenylation  signal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using analysis of RNA-Seq data sets from cells grown under various physiological conditions, we identify 3' UTRs for  nearly 90% of the yeast genes. Heterogeneity of cleavage sites is common, as is  alternative polyadenylation within and between conditions.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with an increased risk of breast cancer. A high 2D:4D ratio is associated with higher oestrogen levels in women, and studies have found a significantly negative correlation between 2"," Context:  BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels. METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  ,  Context: and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether 2D:4D measures are associated with breast  cancer risk. METHODS: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers  (2D:4D), and right minus left 2D:4D (Δ(r-l)) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants' hands collected during a recent follow-up of the  Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469  women. Of the 9044 women with available data, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases.

Age, digital  rectal examination, PSA, free PSA, PSA density, testosterone and SHBG,  pathological report and D2 and D4 measurements were recorded prospectively.  RESULTS: Variables age and SHBG were directly related to PCa. Prostate volume  was inversely related to neoplasia. 2D/4D ratio >0,95 (OR (CI 95%) 4,4  (1,491-13,107) was related to neoplasia. No differences in PCa were seen regarding PSA, free PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination and  testosterone. CONCLUSION: High digit ratio predicts PCa in men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Digit ratio >0,95 has 4-fold risk of PCa compared to men with digit ratio ≤0.95.  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development.

A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Somatic point mutations at a key arginine residue (R132) within the active site  of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) confer a novel gain of  function in cancer cells, resulting in the production of d-2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), an oncometabolite. Elevated 2-HG levels are implicated in epigenetic  alterations and impaired cellular differentiation. IDH1 mutations have been  described in an array of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we  report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant  enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to  effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. Preliminary data from phase 1 clinical trials enrolling patients with cancers harboring an IDH1  mutation indicate that AG-120 has an acceptable safety profile and clinical  activity.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: effect of these drugs will be limited in vivo by the development of drug  resistance, and pre-clinical studies of G12C inhibitors have identified evidence  of this. In this review we discuss the current evidence for G12C inhibitors, the  mechanisms of resistance to G12C inhibitors and potential approaches to overcome  them.

Up to now, eleven small-molecule  IDO1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancers. In  addition, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) based degraders also provide  prospects for cancer therapy.

Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular  disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients. Left ventricular non-compaction diagnosis is often overlooked. Neurological examination should be performed in all patients  with left ventricular non-compaction.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the presentation, diagnosis and management of  isolated left ventricular non-compaction in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with progressive symptoms of heart failure. CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984. This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context:  Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare congenital  cardiomyopathy that affects both children and adults. Since the clinical  manifestations are not sufficient to establish diagnosis, echocardiography is the diagnostic tool that makes it possible to document ventricular  non-compaction and establish prognostic factors. We report a 47-year-old woman  with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with unknown etiology. Echocardiography showed mild left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction (EF =  20-25%). According to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings non-compaction  left ventricle with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered, and right  ,  Context:  Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a rare, morphologically distinct  primary genetic cardiomyopathy, which was first described in children, but is  becoming increasingly recognised in adults.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize  ,  Context: mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,  including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the  C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase θ, illustrating two potential  modes of dimerization. One structure depicts insertion of ddATP opposite an  abasic-site analog during translesion DNA synthesis. The second structure  describes a cognate ddGTP complex. Polymerase θ uses a specialized thumb  subdomain to establish unique upstream contacts to the primer DNA strand,  including an interaction with the 3'-terminal phosphate from one of five  distinctive insertion loops. These observations demonstrate how polymerase θ grasps the primer to bypass DNA lesions or extend poorly annealed DNA termini to  mediate end-joining.  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis. When  2-OH-dATP was present at a concentration equal to those of the four normal dNTPs  in the reaction mixture, DNA synthesis by h Poleta enhanced the frequency of  ,  Context: 3'-phosphotransferase kanamycin kinase. The kanamycin resistance gene was  expressed under the control of the promoter(s) of the putative five-gene operon.  The holB gene is essential for bacterial growth and the deletion of holB  exhibits no polar effects on the adjacent genes tmk or ycfH in terms of cell  viability. The method of the holB null construction presented in this work  allows for a simplified studying of interactions between the different subunits  of DNA polymerase III.  ,  Context:  Altered oxidative metabolism is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., dNTP pool, as well as DNA is a major source of mutagenesis and  carcinogenesis. Here, we report the remarkable nature of human DNA polymerase eta that incorporates oxidized dNTPs into a nascent DNA strand in an efficient  and erroneous manner.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. This is achieved through PP"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context:  Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten  during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length  equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level. The prevailing protein-counting  model for regulating telomerase access to elongate the telomere does not explain  accumulating evidence of a role of DNA replication in telomere length regulation. Here I present an alternative model: the replication fork model that  can explain how passage of a replication fork and regulation of origin firing  affect telomere length.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.

G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context: Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological change in a variety of heart diseases  contributing to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death.  Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis.  Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease;  the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory  actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In  the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of  repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization  of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. The G-rich sequences and the G-quadruplexes were localized adjacent  to the binding motif of signal transducer and activator of transcription  (STAT)3, which negatively regulates relaxin expression. Thus, we hypothesized that the formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes by berberine could  influence relaxin expression. We found that berberine-induced formation of  G-quadruplexes did increase relaxin gene expression measured at mRNA and protein  ,  Context: results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the  function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context:  Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA regions that include at least four closely  spaced runs of three or more consecutive guanosines strongly tend to fold into  stable G-quadruplexes (G4s). G4s play key roles as DNA regulatory sites and as kinetic traps that can inhibit biological processes, but how G4s are regulated  in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a kinetic framework for G4  disruption by DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36), the dominant G4 resolvase in human cells. Using tetramolecular DNA and RNA G4s with four to six G-quartets, we  found that DHX36-mediated disruption is highly efficient, with rates that depend  on G4 length under saturating conditions (kcat) but not under subsaturating  ,  Context:  Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner.

Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a  conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic  helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also  ,  Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context: Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to  mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. We  describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE  information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and  splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main  types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins.  Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits  were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for  editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts  are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely  membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of specific RNA editing events on ion channel subunits do  not suggest that loss of RNA editing events in ion channels consistently produce  a particular outcome such as making Adar mutant neurons more excitable. This  ,  Context: this event are being clarified in Drosophila melanogaster, little is know about  the embryogenic processes in other insect species. The recent publication of  expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from embryos of the global pest species Ceratitis  capitata (medfly) has enabled the investigation of embryogenesis in this species  and has allowed a comparison of the embryogenic processes in these two related  dipteran species, C. capitata and D. melanogaster, that shared a common ancestor  80-100 mya.  RESULTS: Using a novel PCR-based sexing method, which takes advantage of a  putative LTR retrotransposon MITE insertion on the medfly Y chromosome, the  transcriptomes of individual early male and female embryos were analysed using RT-PCR. This study is focused on two crucial aspects of the onset of embryonic  development: sex determination and cellular blastoderm formation. Together with  the three known medfly genes (Cctransformer, Cctransformer2 and Ccdoublesex), the expression patterns of other medfly genes that are similar to the D.  melanogaster sex-determination genes (sisterlessA, groucho, deadpan, Sex-lethal,  female lethal d, sans fille and intersex) and four cellular blastoderm formation  ","8892234, 8955148, 8989517, 18254933, 21761288, 20102629",Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding proteins.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Antacids, catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, acetazolamide, imatinib, diuretics, and bisphosphonates are commonly used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to"," Context: frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This  review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: unknown. In this study, we investigated nicotinamide as a potential therapy for  tumoral calcinosis, using a murine model of the disease-Galnt3 knockout mice.  Initially, five different doses of nicotinamide were given to normal  heterozygous mice intraperitoneally or orally. Treatment had no effect on serum  phosphate levels, but serum levels of a phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth  factor 23 (Fgf23), decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, high-dose  nicotinamide (40mM) was tested in Galnt3 knockout mice fed a high phosphate  diet. The radiographic data pre- and post-treatment showed that nicotinamide did  not reverse the calcification. However, the treatment retarded calcification growth after 4weeks, while in the untreated animals, calcifications increased in  size. The therapy did not affect serum phosphate levels, but intact Fgf23  decreased in the treated mice. The treated mice also had increased calcium in the heart. In summary, nicotinamide did not alter serum phosphate levels, likely  due to compensatory decrease in Fgf23 to counteract the phosphate lowering  effect of nicotinamide. Although increased calcium accumulation in the heart is  ,  Context: phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: were confirmed. Plasma phosphate returned to normal values 90 days after the  iron administration. (ii) A 40-year-old man with a history of CML in whom  imatinib was started. He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating  drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context: Personalized medicine is an emerging field with a goal of applying genomic  information as a predictor of disease risk as well as individualization of drug  therapy. For optimization of drug therapy, significant progress has been made in  the past decade in linking genetic variation in genes associated with drug  disposition to prediction of drug response and adverse reactions. For most drugs  in clinical use, the interplay of many factors, including genetics,  demographics, drug-drug interactions, disease states and the environment, result  in the interindividual variability observed during drug therapy. Broadly  speaking, such determinants of drug response are mediated through modulation of drug concentrations reflective of pharmacokinetic factors, as well as drug  targets, often referred to as pharmacodynamics. It is clear that for  personalized medicine to become clinically meaningful, genomic as well as clinical and environmental influences must be considered together. We show, for  a number of drugs in clinical use, that genomics-guided treatment options not  only are becoming feasible but are also on the cusp of showing superiority in  ,  Context: Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare  disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia  resulting from renal phosphate wasting. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a  noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone  mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations  in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we  describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a  novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a  50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage. Biochemical examination revealed  hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate excretion and low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D.  Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were within the normal range, leading to clinical diagnosis of ARHR.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains, suggesting a role in regulating DNA replication. Specifically, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage"," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: O-linked glucosylation of thymine in DNA (base J) is an important regulatory  epigenetic mark in trypanosomatids. β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J)  synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming  5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU). hmU is then glucosylated by a previously unknown  glucosyltransferase. A recent computational screen identified a possible  candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes. We demonstrate that recombinant JGT utilizes uridine diphosphoglucose  to transfer glucose to hmU in the context of dsDNA. Mutation of conserved  residues typically involved in glucosyltransferase catalysis impairs DNA glucosylation in vitro. The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of  Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J.  Reintroduction of JGT in the JGT KO restores J synthesis. Ablation of JGT mRNA  ,  Context: Epigenetics is one of the most rapidly expanding fields in biology. The recent  characterization of a human DNA methylome at single nucleotide resolution, the  discovery of the CpG island shores, the finding of new histone variants and  modifications, and the unveiling of genome-wide nucleosome positioning maps  highlight the accelerating speed of discovery over the past two years.  Increasing interest in epigenetics has been accompanied by technological breakthroughs that now make it possible to undertake large-scale epigenomic  studies. These allow the mapping of epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation,  histone modifications and nucleosome positioning, which are critical for regulating gene and noncoding RNA expression. In turn, we are learning how  aberrant placement of these epigenetic marks and mutations in the epigenetic  machinery is involved in disease. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of  ,  Context: environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: DNA methylation and histone acetylation are major epigenetic modifications in  gene silencing. In our previous research, we found that the methylated  oligonucleotide (SurKex) complementary to a region of promoter of survivin could  induce DNA methylation in a site-specific manner leading to survivin silencing.  Here, we further studied the role of histone acetylation in survivin silencing  and the relationship between histone acetylation and DNA methylation. First we observed the levels of histone H4 and H4K16 acetylation that were decreased  after SurKex treatment by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.  Next, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in survivin silencing after blockade of histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A  (TSA). We assessed survivin mRNA expression by RT-PCR, measured survivin  promoter methylation by bisulfite sequencing and examined the level of histone  ","27131378, 19571682, 24891501, 20944598, 23345616, 21130077","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome  and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport  channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the  ,  Context: Bartter syndrome is a rare heterogeneous disease characterised by a deficiency  in sodium and chloride absorption. Gain-of-function mutations in the CASR gene  have been described in some patients with Bartter syndrome associated with  hypocalcaemia and hypercalciuria. We describe a case of adult-onset Bartter  syndrome with hypocalcaemia severe enough to cause osteomalacia. LEARNING POINTS: Bartter syndrome is one of the rare heterogenous diseases that present with electrolyte disturbances.Bartter syndrome type 5 also causes  hypercalciuria which is not severe enough to cause osteomalacia.Patients with  adult-onset Bartter syndrome should be screened promptly for osteomalacia to prevent pathological fractures and consequent complications.  ,  Context:  Bartter syndrome encompasses a variety of inheritable renal tubular transport  disorders characterized by hypokalemia and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.  Bartter syndrome Type III is caused by genetic alterations in the chloride channel kidney B (CLCNKB) gene and often presents in the first 2 years of life,  known as classic Bartter syndrome. However, in rare cases Bartter syndrome Type  III has an antenatal presentation with polyhydramnios, premature delivery and severe dehydration in the first weeks of life. Associations between congenital  anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and Bartter syndrome are extremely  rare. This case report presents a girl with Bartter syndrome Type III due to a  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes recent advances in our understanding of  the genetic heterogeneity, pathophysiology and treatment of Bartter syndrome, a  group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle.  Consequently, individuals with Bartter syndrome exhibit renal salt wasting and  lowered blood pressure, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypercalciuria with a variable risk of renal stones.

Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent reports suggest that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: proteins involved in neurotransmission predominate as targets of such  modifications. Previous reports suggest that RNA editing is responsive to  environmental inputs in the form of temperature alterations. However, the  molecular determinants underlying temperature-dependent RNA editing responses  are not well understood. RESULTS: Using the poikilotherm Drosophila, we show that acute temperature  alterations within a normal physiological range result in substantial changes in  RNA editing levels. Our examination of particular sites reveals diversity in the  patterns with which editing responds to temperature, and these patterns are conserved across five species of Drosophilidae representing over 10 million  years of divergence. In addition, we show that expression of the editing enzyme,  ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to  temperature. Interestingly, this reduction in editing enzyme levels at elevated  temperature is only partially reversed by a return to lower temperatures.  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.  ,  Context: Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers  and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an  ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing. This chapter  describes a variety of methods for genetically manipulating Drosophila A-to-I  editing both in time and space, as well as techniques to study the molecular  basis of ADAR-mRNA interactions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis.  Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet represents an optimal approach to the treatment of diabetes. This manuscript  reviews the pharmacology, safety and benefits of the combination pill Avandamet.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their  lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission.

METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the  following clinical question: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to  control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for  this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014 (Clinical  Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most  up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a  ,  Context: The retrovirus HIV-1 is the etiological agent of the decades-long AIDS pandemic.  Although vaccination is the most common preexposure route to prevent acquisition  of viral disease, scalable efficacious vaccination strategies have yet to be  developed for HIV-1. By contrast, small molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 enzymes  reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease have been developed that  effectively block virus replication. Three different drug compounds are commonly prescribed for people living with HIV as once-daily oral tablets. Once-daily  pills composed of two different reverse transcriptase inhibitors are moreover  approved as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment for virus naïve individuals who may partake in behaviors associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition  such as unprotected sex or injection drug use. Long-acting (LA) injectable HIV-1  enzyme inhibitors are at the same time being developed to sidestep adherence  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be adapted to increase its complementarity to a mutated splice donor site, allowing it to correct aberrant splicing of endogenously expressed transcripts. This adaptation can be used as a gene therapeutic approach, as shown by the"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show  that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217,  including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed  ,  Context: in a large consanguineous family allowed us to identify the splice donor site  (SD) mutation c.479G>A in exon 5 of BBS1. Clinically affected family members  show symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) but lack other primary features that  would clearly support the diagnosis of BBS. In agreement with this exceptionally  mild BBS1-associated phenotype, we did not detect obvious ciliary defects in  patient-derived cells. SDs are bound by the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1), a process  that initiates exon recognition during splicing. The mutation described herein  interferes with U1 binding and induces aberrant splicing of BBS1. For a gene  therapeutic approach, we have adapted the sequence of U1 to increase its complementarity to the mutated SD. Lentiviral treatment of patient-derived  fibroblasts with the adapted U1 partially corrected aberrant splicing of  endogenously expressed BBS1 transcripts. This therapeutic effect was dose-dependent. Our results show that the adaptation of U1 can correct  pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations and suggest a high potential  for gene therapy.  ,  Context: CaP and 2 cell lines.

Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out  using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master  Mix. miRNA expression levels were measured by relative quantification, and fold  expression changes were determined by the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. The small nucleolar  RNA RNU43 was used as an endogenous control. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs  significantly changed during the progression of CaP. Interestingly, there was a  significant global loss of miRNA expression between HGPIN and metastasis at 2 important steps. The first was related to the transition from HGPIN to invasive  adenocarcinoma, and the second was related to the transition from localized to  metastatic adenocarcinomas.  ,  Context: scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly  progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well  into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria  is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed  Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal  posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations  found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%).  Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways. Potential  therapeutic strategies are developed along these lines and include RNA interference techniques and inhibition of the dominant-negative influence of  abnormally formed Lamin A on polymerization with normally formed Lamin A.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Steep increases in herpes zoster (HZ) incidence, hospitalization due  to HZ and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication of HZ occur in  people over 50 years of age. Two HZ vaccines are currently authorized for use in  those 50 years of age and older in Canada: a live attenuated zoster vaccine  (LZV) authorized in 2008; and a recombinant subunit vaccine (RZV) authorized in  October 2017. OBJECTIVES: To review current evidence and develop guidance on whether the  previously authorized LZV (Zostavax®) and/or the recently authorized RZV  (Shingrix®) vaccine should be offered to Canadians 50 years of age and older: 1)  at a population-level, in publicly funded immunization programs; and 2) at an individual-level, to individuals wishing to prevent HZ, or by clinicians wishing  to advise individual patients about preventing HZ. METHODS: The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) Herpes Zoster Working Group developed a predefined search strategy to identify all eligible  studies, assessed their quality, and summarized and analyzed the findings. A  Cost Utility Analysis of LZV and RZV was also conducted from a health care  ,  Context: risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased  risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.  ,  Context: postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its  high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET  scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq).  Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical  studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as  a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain. It was then  approved earlier this year by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  ,  Context: EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c,  FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body  weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop  diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60  ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side  effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin  offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable  side-effect profile.

The survey included questions about patients'  experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of  222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from  baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry  about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school  responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social,  and professional life were also reported.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) was detected in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined, and GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was expressed in nine of 14 NSCLC cell"," Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.

BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists. PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However,  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context:  A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962  explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different  bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context:  We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

At least 28  genes and 12 loci have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)  and related inherited neuropathies. Most causes of inherited neuropathy have  been discovered by positional cloning technique and in the past two years, the  pace of CMT gene discovery has accelerated. Genetic studies have revealed the  following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ,  EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating  form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal  recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for CMT2 (autosomal dominant axonal form); LMNA, GAN1, KCC3, TDP1, APTX, SETX for  AR-CMT2 (autosomal recessive axonal form); GIB1 for CMTX (X-linked CMT); DNM2  for CMT-DI (autosomal dominant CMT with intermediate nerve conduction velocities); and DHH for minifascicular neuropathy. These discovered CMT causing  genes/proteins include those which show unpredictable correlations with the  peripheral nervous system. However, these genes/proteins are definitely  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context: disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type  B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated  with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth  neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context: canes, wheelchairs as needed for mobility; exercise as tolerated; symptomatic  treatment of pain, depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome. Prevention  of secondary complications: Daily heel cord stretching to prevent Achilles'  tendon shortening. Surveillance: Monitoring gait and condition of feet to  determine need for bracing, special shoes, surgery. Agents/circumstances to  avoid: Obesity, which makes ambulation more difficult; medications known to  cause nerve damage (e.g., vincristine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin). Other: Career  and employment counseling. GENETIC COUNSELING: Most subtypes of CMT2 are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, some are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most  probands with an autosomal dominant CMT2 subtype have inherited the pathogenic  variant from an affected parent. The offspring of an individual with autosomal dominant CMT2 are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant.  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) constitutes a large group of genetically  heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: With the global improvement of iodine nutrition, iodine excess is  emerging as a new concern. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to illustrate the physiological effects and potential molecular mechanisms of excessive iodine intake on lipid  metabolism. METHODS: Balb/c mice were given drinking water containing different levels of  iodine for 1 month and treated with 1.2 microg/mL iodine for different periods of time, respectively. Plasma lipid parameters and serum thyroid hormones were  measured. Expressions of hepatic genes were detected by real-time polymerase  chain reactions and Western blot.  ,  Context: nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the  interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in  existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated  release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again  recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine  thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed  systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can  be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is  negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be  considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the  replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake  is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine  release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up  ,  Context:  Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid malignancy after  PTC. There are marked geographical variations in the relative proportions of FTC  and PTC, most likely related to dietary iodine content. In iodine-deficient areas, the relative rate of FTC tends to be increased. Other risk factors for  FTC include age over 50 years and female sex. Genetic factors may also have a  role in determining disease susceptibility but remain ill-defined. Histologically, FTC is characterized by follicle formation and the absence of  any papillary elements in the tumor. Differential diagnosis from a benign  adenoma can be difficult. The degree of vascular invasiveness seems to correlate  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations  ,  Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch  1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading  to aberrantly high Notch signaling. In this report, we determine whether T-ALL  mutations occur not only in Notch1 but also in the F-box protein hCdc4 (Sel-10,  Ago, or Fbxw7), a negative regulator of Notch1. We show that the hCDC4 gene is  mutated in leukemic cells from more than 30% of patients with pediatric T-ALL  and derived cell lines. Most hCDC4 mutations found were missense substitutions  at critical arginine residues (Arg(465), Arg(479), and Arg(505)) localized in  the substrate-binding region of hCdc4. Cells inactivated for hCdc4 and T-ALL cells containing hCDC4 mutations exhibited an increased Notch1 protein  half-life, consistent with the proposed role of hCdc4 in ubiquitin-dependent  proteolysis of Notch1. Furthermore, restoration of wild-type but not mutant hCdc4 in HCT 116 hCDC4-negative cells led to an increased Notch1 ubiquitylation  and decreased Notch1 signaling. These results show that hCdc4 mutations  interfere with normal Notch1 regulation in vivo. Finally, we found that  ,  Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is an orphan  disease caused by biallelic mutations at the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, with a  prevalence estimated at 1 : 250 000 to 1 : 630 000. HoFH is characterized by  extremely elevated plasma levels of LDL-C greater than 10 mmol/l (>387 mg/dl),  tendinous and cutaneous xanthomas in youth and premature atherosclerotic  cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The expected prevalence varies from country to country depending on the presence of founder effects, genetic probability and  life expectancy. Untreated, HoFH is a fatal condition before age 30. Plasma  levels of LDL-C are the major cause of mortality and the therapeutic target. Statin therapy led to a remarkable improvement in survival but is of limited use  in loss-of-function LDLR gene variants or 'null' mutations.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"Med220 and Med70 are two subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. Additionally, different activators bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex."," Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: Transposable elements comprise roughly 40% of mammalian genomes. They have an  active role in genetic variation, adaptation and evolution through the  duplication or deletion of genes or their regulatory elements, and transposable  elements themselves can act as alternative promoters for nearby genes, resulting  in non-canonical regulation of transcription. However, transposable element  activity can lead to detrimental genome instability, and hosts have evolved  mechanisms to silence transposable element mobility appropriately. Recent  studies have demonstrated that a subset of transposable elements, endogenous  retroviral elements (ERVs) containing long terminal repeats (LTRs), are silenced through trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by ESET (also known  as SETDB1 or KMT1E) and a co-repressor complex containing KRAB-associated  protein 1 (KAP1; also known as TRIM28) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we show that the replacement histone variant H3.3 is enriched at class I and class  II ERVs, notably those of the early transposon (ETn)/MusD family and  intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs). Deposition at a subset of these elements  ,  Context:  Cristae junctions mark the boundaries of respiratory compartments in the inner  mitochondrial membrane. In this issue of Developmental Cell, von der Malsburg  et al. (2011) identify a complex, MINOS, that organizes cristae junctions.

The hCtf4-CMG complex, like the hCMG complex, contains DNA  helicase activity that is more salt-resistant than the helicase activity of the  hCMG complex. We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric  hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts  as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex. The role of the hCMG  complex as the core of the replisome is also discussed.  ,  Context: Gamma-secretase is a multiprotein, intramembrane-cleaving protease with a  growing list of protein substrates, including the Notch receptors and the  amyloid precursor protein. The four components of gamma-secretase  complex--presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), Pen2, and Aph1--are all thought to be  essential for activity. The catalytic domain resides within PS proteins, NCT has  been suggested to be critical for substrate recognition, and the contributions of Pen2 and Aph1 remain unclear. The role of NCT has been challenged recently by  the observation that a critical residue (E332) in NCT, which had been thought to  be essential for gamma-secretase activity, is instead involved in complex maturation. Here, we report that NCT is dispensable for gamma-secretase  activity. NCT-independent gamma-secretase activity can be detected in two  independent NCT-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast lines and blocked by the  gamma-secretase inhibitors  ,  Context: Post-transcriptional regulatory networks are dependent on the interplay of many  RNA-binding proteins having a major role in mRNA processing events in mammals.  We have been interested in the concerted action of the two RNA-binding proteins  hnRNP A1 and HuR, both stable components of immunoselected hnRNP complexes and  having a major nuclear localization. Specifically, we present here the  application of the RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP)-Chip technology to identify a population of nuclear transcripts associated with hnRNP A1-RNPs as isolated from  the nuclear extract of either HuR WT or HuR-depleted (KO) mouse embryonic  fibroblast (MEF) cells. The outcome of this analysis was a list of target genes regulated via HuR for their association (either increased or reduced) with the  nuclear hnRNP A1-RNP complexes.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive bacterium, was shown to release EVs, which were purified and characterized using density gradient ultracentrifugation"," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: The term 'quorum sensing' describes intercellular bacterial communication which  regulates bacterial gene expression according to population cell density.  Bacteria produce and secrete small molecules, named autoinducers, into the  intercellular space. The concentration of these molecules increases as a  function of population cell density. Once the concentration of the stimulatory  threshold is reached, alteration in gene expression occurs. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria possess different types of quorum sensing systems.  Canonical LuxI/R-type/acyl homoserine lactone mediated quorum sensing system is  the best studied quorum sensing circuit and is described in Gram-negative bacteria which employ it for inter-species communication mostly. Gram-positive  bacteria possess a peptide-mediated quorum sensing system. Bacteria can  communicate within their own species (intra-species) but also between species  ,  Context: enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli strains and to examine its interaction  with host components that could be related to the infection mechanism.  Recombinant E. coli GAPDH was purified and polyclonal antibodies were obtained.  Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on  the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC  strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external  medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme.  Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional  electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is  secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in  Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC. These  observations indicate that exported GAPDH may act as a virulence factor which  could contribute to EHEC and EPEC pathogenesis.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically the AMPK-α2 isoform."," Context: RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a  high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.  ,  Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context:  Stress signals elicit a wide variety of cellular responses, many of which  converge on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 kinases, the activation of which  has been well-characterized. How these kinases are switched off by dephosphorylation is not well understood. Here we describe how diverse cellular  stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating  dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6. Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6  phosphatase. However, while anisomycin treatment of cells leads to M3/6 protein  degradation, arsenite appears to inactivate M3/6 directly.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is a poly(A) polymerase enzyme involved in the process of polyadenylation, where it adds adenosine residues to the 3' end of mRNA. It has been isolated and characterized through chromatographic procedures, and"," Context: PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively  studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly  defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism  and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa  and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect  on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as  observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In  addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected  cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated  p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78.  ,  Context:  The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic  cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and  exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and RNase II. The poly(A) tails are homogenous, containing only  adenosines in most of the growth conditions. In the chloroplast, however, the  same enzyme, PNPase, polyadenylates and degrades the RNA molecule; there is no equivalent for the E. coli poly(A) polymerase enzyme. Because cyanobacteria is a  prokaryote believed to be related to the evolutionary ancestor of the  chloroplast, we asked whether the molecular mechanism of RNA polyadenylation in  ,  Context: Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a  crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  Recently, new roles for succinate outside metabolism have emerged. Succinate  stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in  specific tumors and in activated macrophages, and stimulates dendritic cells via  its receptor succinate receptor 1. Furthermore, succinate has been shown to post-translationally modify proteins. This expanding repertoire of functions for  succinate suggests a broader role in cellular activation. We review the new  roles of succinate and draw parallels to other metabolites such as NAD(+) and citrate whose roles have expanded beyond metabolism and into signaling.  ,  Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five  polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic  mRNA. The factors were separated from each other by fractionation of HeLa cell  nuclear extract in two consecutive chromatographic steps. RNA cleavage at the L3  polyadenylation site of human adenovirus 2 required at least four factors.  Addition of adenosine residues required only two of these factors. The  fractionation procedure separates two components that are both likely to be  poly(A) polymerases. The candidate poly(A) polymerases were interchangeable and  participated during both RNA cleavage and adenosine addition. They were discriminated from each other by chromatographic properties, heat sensitivity  and divalent cation requirement. We have compared our data with published  information and have been able to correlate the activities that we have isolated to previously identified polyadenylation factors. However, we have not been able  to assign one of the candidate poly(A) polymerases to a previously identified  poly(A) polymerase. This simple fractionation procedure can be used for  ,  Context: breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages.  It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able  to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond  immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in  clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area  of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues  remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of  exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of  other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their  mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter  issue.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function causes defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.," Context: addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  and the prominent roles of Ihh in coordinating skeletogenesis, genetic ablation  of Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired  Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast  differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures. Our data  demonstrate that Scube2 plays a key regulatory role in Ihh-dependent  endochondral bone formation.  ,  Context: Protecting replication fork integrity during DNA replication is essential for  maintaining genome stability. Here, we report that SDE2, a PCNA-associated  protein, plays a key role in maintaining active replication and counteracting  replication stress by regulating the replication fork protection complex (FPC).  SDE2 directly interacts with the FPC component TIMELESS (TIM) and enhances its  stability, thereby aiding TIM localization to replication forks and the  coordination of replisome progression. Like TIM deficiency, knockdown of SDE2  leads to impaired fork progression and stalled fork recovery, along with a  failure to activate CHK1 phosphorylation. Moreover, loss of SDE2 or TIM results in an excessive MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks. Together, our  study uncovers an essential role for SDE2 in maintaining genomic integrity by  stabilizing the FPC and describes a new role for TIM in protecting stalled replication forks. We propose that TIM-mediated fork protection may represent a  way to cooperate with BRCA-dependent fork stabilization.  ,  Context: Circadian clocks are endogenous and biological oscillations that occur with a  period of <24 h. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is localized in the  suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is linked to peripheral tissues through neural  and hormonal signals. In the present study, we investigated the physiological  function of the molecular clock on bone remodeling. The results of  loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments both indicated that the rhythmic expression of Tnfrsf11b, which encodes osteoprotegerin (OPG), was  regulated by Bmal1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We also showed that REV-ERBα negatively  regulated Tnfrsf11b as well as Bmal1 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We systematically investigated the relationship between the sympathetic nervous system and the  circadian clock in osteoblasts. The administration of phenylephrine, a  nonspecific α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist, stimulated the expression of  ,  Context: The long QT syndrome gene human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) encodes a K(+)  channel critical to cardiac repolarization. It peculiarly overexpresses in  cancer cells of different histogenesis and promotes tumorigenesis. To decipher  the molecular mechanisms for HERG overexpression, we identified and  characterized the promoter region of the HERG gene, which contains cis-elements  for multiple oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. Oncoprotein Sp1 was found to be  essential to driving the HERG promoter thereby transcription. Another  oncoprotein NF-kappaB transactivated, while tumor suppressor Nkx3.1 repressed  HERG promoter activity and endogenous HERG transcription. Loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding cis-elements rendered a loss of the ability of  the oncoproteins Sp1 and NF-kappaB to transactivate, and of the tumor repressor  Nkx3.1 to repress, HERG transcription. Either activation of Sp1 and NF-kappaB or silencing of Nkx3.1 promoted tumor cell growth, and the effects were abrogated  by HERG inhibition or knockdown, but facilitated by overexpression of HERG,  indicating that HERG mediates the cell growth signals generated by activation of  ,  Context: Repression of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana requires activity of  the COP9 signalosome (CSN), CDD, and COP1 complexes, but how these three  complexes work in concert to accomplish this important developmental switch has  remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis CULLIN4 (CUL4)  associates with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit to form an active  E3 ubiquitin ligase both in vivo and in vitro. The partial loss of function of CUL4 resulted in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype with respect to  morphogenesis and light-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, CUL4 exhibits a  synergistic genetic interaction with COP10 and DET1. Therefore, this CUL4-based E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis. This CUL4-based  E3 ligase appears to associate physically with COP1 E3 ligase and positively  regulates the COP1-dependent degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide is used as a diagnostic imaging agent to identify the presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors in patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer. It allows for noninvasive monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment and," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets  FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout  treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion  diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized  medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent  ,  Context: Etanercept is a protein comprised of the extracellular domains of two TNF  receptors attached to a Fc portion of an IgG.

Moreover,  combination therapy with methotrexate will be attractive for severely active  patients. The proportion of patients who have discontinued therapy due to  adverse events is approximately 4%. Etanercept has not raised the risk for  serious infections(0.04/patient-year) as well as malignancies. There are  sporadic case reports of aplastic anemia, demyelination, lupus-like conditions, which are not significant so far.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a pediatric neurodegenerative disease."," Context:  Cerliponase alfa (Brineura™) is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase-1  (TPP1) being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. for use in patients with  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), a paediatric neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections.

Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies  included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme  replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher  disease.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues, including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart tissue, and cartilaginous structures."," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is  driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing,  art, education and medicine. Recent advances have enabled 3D printing of  biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures. Other applications include developing  ,  Context: rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is  useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals  avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the  surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and  can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth,  excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D  printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of  interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the  visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia. An immediate  application of this technique is represented by educational classes.  ,  Context: The aim of tissue engineering is to produce functional three-dimensional (3D)  tissue substitutes. Regarding native organ and tissue complexity, cell density  and cell spatial 3D organization, which influence cell behavior and fate, are  key parameters in tissue engineering. Laser-Assisted Bioprinting (LAB) allows  one to print cells and liquid materials with a cell- or picoliter-level  resolution. Thus, LAB seems to be an emerging and promising technology to  fabricate tissue-like structures that have the physiological functionality of  their native counterparts. This technology has additional advantages such as  automation, reproducibility, and high throughput. It makes LAB compatible with the (industrial) fabrication of 3D constructs of physiologically relevant sizes.  Here we present exhaustively the numerous steps that allow printing of viable  cells with a well-preserved micrometer pattern. To facilitate the understanding of the whole cell patterning experiment using LAB, it is discussed in two parts:  (1) preprocessing: laser set-up, bio-ink cartridge and bio-paper preparation,  and pattern design; and (2) processing: bio-ink printing on the bio-paper.  ,  Context: printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on  a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In  this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the production process is demonstrated by producing a set of eyeglass frames from 3D  blueprints.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context: subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6,  SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol  metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by  regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the  C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group P3(2) with unit-cell parameters a = 67.2, b = 67.2, c = 257.5 Å. The Matthews  coefficient was determined to be 3.41 Å(3) Da(-1) with two molecules in the  asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by the single-anomalous  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas (AAM) represent 20% of all meningiomas. They  are associated with poor outcomes due to their tendency to recur. While surgery  and radiation (RT) are first line therapy, no effective systemic medical  treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro. The antitumor effects of combining LB-100  with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients  with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have  refractory disease. This study aims at investigating the antitumor,  antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic activities of dovitinib in preclinical  models of HCC. METHODS: 21-0208 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the antitumor effect of dovitinib. Changes of biomarkers  relevant to FGFR/VEGFR/PDGFR pathways were determined by Western blotting.  Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with dovitinib resulted in G2/M cell cycle  arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and blockade of bFGF-induced  cell migration. Dovitinib inhibited basal expression and FGF-induced  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: maintenance of cell identity and gene silencing patterns. We recently showed  that expression of the BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG genes is separated during normal  B-cell development in germinal centers, whereas Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS)  cells co-express BMI-1 and EZH2. In the current study, we used  immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to determine whether the binding  partners of these PcG proteins are also present in H/RS cells and H/RS-derived  cell lines. PcG expression profiles were analyzed in combination with expression  of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a, because experimental model systems  indicate that p16 is a downstream target of Bmi-1. We found that H/RS cells and HL-derived cell lines co-express all core proteins of the two known PcG  complexes, including BMI-1, MEL-18, RING1, HPH1, HPC1, and -2, EED, EZH2, YY1,  and the HPC2 binding partner, CtBP. Expression of HPC1 has not been found in normal mature B cells and other malignant lymphomas of B-cell origin, suggesting  that the PcG expression profile of H/RS is unique. In contrast to Bmi-1  transgenic mice where p16INK4a is down-regulated, 27 of 52 BMI-1POS cases of HL  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. In one study, 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period after intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm twist drill at the time of"," Context: MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth,  accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small  percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases. Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body  tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and  bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration. Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying  dental implant failure. PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, AGY cannot be used as an antidiuretic replacement therapy. In patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD), AGY was found to lower lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LMER), indicating improved gut function"," Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for  ,  Context: is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic. In this paper,  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context: of acute heart failure. CRS type 3 is represented by acute cardiac failure  following AKI, often occurring as a consequence of nephrotoxins. Diagnosis of  CRS should preferably be made on basis of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global  Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for the diagnosis and staging of AKI. The cardiac  diagnostic workup should include echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG),  cardiac enzymes, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The therapeutic approach  in CRS is primarily aimed at treating the causative organ dysfunction. In case  of CRS type 3 this means ensuring adequate kidney perfusion, cautious fluid  management, and avoiding additional nephrotoxins. In case of diuretic resistant fluid overload, early initiation of extracorporeal fluid removal, preferably by  renal replacement therapy, should be considered.  ,  Context: The use of anticancer drugs is beneficial for patients with malignancies but is  frequently associated with the occurrence of electrolyte disorders, which can be  hazardous and in many cases fatal. The review presents the electrolyte  abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat prostate cancer, endometriosis, and uterine leiomyomas (also known as uterine fibroids)."," Context: months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels  within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  ,  Context: cancer and, more specifically, in the progression to hormone-refractory clinical  behavior. These 4 studies were similar in some relevant aspects, such as the  patient population. In fact, the patients in each study were divided into 3  groups that represent the progression of prostate cancer. In 3 of 4 studies, a  statistically significant increase in ErbB-2 expression was detected by  immunohistochemistry in the progression from hormone-dependent to  hormone-independent disease. The expression of EGFR was also evaluated in 1 of  the 4 studies. In a recent report from our group, a significant increase in EGFR  expression was observed in patients treated with radical surgery, in patients who received hormonal therapy as primary therapy before radical prostatectomy,  and, finally, in patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory disease. It has  been proposed that EGFR family receptors and androgen receptors function synergistically in the absence of androgen suggesting cross-talk between the  ErbB-2 and androgen receptor pathways, and that mitogen-activated protein kinase  and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase can be considered the transduction pathways.  ,  Context: group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well  tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: maximum NRS score of ≤1 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study  drug. Secondary end points: proportion of patients with no pain (NRS = 0) and  percentage of days without pain during the 28-day period before the final dose  of study drug; adverse events. RESULT(S): More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo achieved a maximum  NRS score of ≤1 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study drug  (57.6% vs. 3.1%). Similarly, more patients receiving relugolix versus placebo  achieved a maximum NRS score of 0 (48.5% vs. 3.1%) and experienced more days  without pain (96.4% vs. 71.4%). More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 87.9% vs. 56.3%); however,  the rate of treatment discontinuation was low and not different between groups.  Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity. TEAEs (≥10%) included hot flush, metrorrhagia, hyperhidrosis, and menorrhagia, consistent with relugolix's  mechanism of action, and viral upper respiratory tract infection.

Breath analysis  with FT-IR was fast and easy, and no sample preparation was needed. The analyzer was adequately sensitive and accurate in detecting and quantitating clinically  relevant amounts of ethanol and methanol in the breath of seriously ill  patients. FT-IR spectrometry was also suitable for nearly on-line monitoring of the exhaled ethanol and methanol during hemodialysis. The breath analysis  results correlated well with blood samples. The FT-IR method used also has a  traceable calibration to physical properties of the analyte, and the measured  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context: CLIP-Seq protocols such as PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP or iCLIP allow a genome-wide  analysis of protein-RNA interactions. For the processing of the resulting short  read data, various tools are utilized. Some of these tools were specifically  developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of  RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the  available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is  because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed  and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard  dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that  can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we  also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak  calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) experiments result in complex  multi-dimensional datasets, which require specialist data analysis tools.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems such as global and local sequence alignment. A reconfigurable systolic architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA to efficiently treat several dynamic programming methods, achieving a"," Context: Reconfigurable systolic arrays can be adapted to efficiently resolve a wide  spectrum of computational problems; parallelism is naturally explored in  systolic arrays and reconfigurability allows for redefinition of the  interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments.

It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.  ,  Context: Such approaches fail to exploit the full information from both raw sequencing  data and the reference genome that can yield better quality sequence reads,  SNP-calls, variant detection, as well as an alignment at the best possible  location in the reference genome. Thus, there is a need for novel  reference-guided bioinformatics algorithms for interpreting analog signals  representing sequences of the bases ({A, C, G, T}), while simultaneously  aligning possible sequence reads to a source reference genome whenever  available. RESULTS: Here, we propose a new base-calling algorithm, TotalReCaller, to  achieve improved performance. A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a  Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible  genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array  (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance. Empirical results on real  high-throughput Illumina data were used to evaluate TotalReCaller's performance  ","16342039, 22151470, 18412963, 19492068, 21724593","Yes.

CONCLUSIONS: Low serum testosterone is an independent risk factor for  predominant Gleason pattern 4 on prostate specimen after RP and for upgrading  from low- to high-grade cancer between prostate needle biopsies and RP specimen.  This observation should be taken into account in localised PCa management,  especially for active surveillance or when a nerve-sparing approach is  considered.  ,  Context: several tools and methodologies in its study of comparative genomics, many of  which have been incorporated into the UCSC Genome Browser  (http://genome.ucsc.edu), an easy-to-use online tool for browsing genomic data  and aligned annotation ""tracks"" in a single window. The comparative genomics  annotations in the browser include pairwise alignments, which aid in the  identification of orthologous regions between species, and conservation tracks  that show measures of evolutionary conservation among sets of multiply aligned  species, highlighting regions of the genome that may be functionally important.  A related tool, the UCSC Table Browser, provides a simple interface for querying, analyzing, and downloading the data underlying the Genome Browser  annotation tracks. Here, we describe a procedure for examining a genomic region  of interest in the Genome Browser, analyzing characteristics of the region, filtering the data, and downloading data sets for further study.  ,  Context: and temporal dynamics. In systems nanobi-ology, cellular processes are  quantitatively investigated at the sensitivity level of single molecules and  cells. This approach provides direct access to biomolecular information without  being statistically ensemble-averaged, their associated distribution functions,  and possible subpopulations. Moreover at the single cell level, the interplay of  regulated genomic information and proteomic variabilities can be investigated  and attributed to functional peculiarities. These requirements necessitate the  development of novel and ultrasensitive methods and instruments for single  molecule detection, microscopy and spectroscopy for analysis without the need of amplification and preconcentration. In this chapter, we present three  methodological applications that demonstrate how quantitative informations can  be accessed that are representative for cellular processes or single cell analysis like gene expression regulation, intracellular protein translocation  dynamics, and single cell protein fingerprinting. First, the interaction  kinetics of transcriptionally regulated DNA-protein interaction can be  ,  Context: The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now  operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on  single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage  destroys the sample. In a single molecule imaging (SMI) experiment thousands of  diffraction patterns of single molecules with random orientations are recorded.  One of the most challenging problems of SMI is how to assemble these noisy patterns of unknown orientations into a consistent single set of diffraction  data. Here we present a new method which can solve the orientation problem of  SMI efficiently even for large biological molecules and in the presence of noise. We show on simulated diffraction patterns of a large protein molecule,  how the orientations of the patterns can be found and the structure to atomic  resolution can be solved. The concept of our algorithm could be also applied to  ,  Context: unneeded mitochondria (mitophagy) is a rapidly growing area in development,  cancer, and neurodegeneration, particularly with regard to Parkinson's disease.  Due to its dynamic nature, and the potential for regulatory perturbation by  disease processes, no single technique is sufficient to evaluate mitophagy.  Here, we describe several complementary techniques that include electron  microscopy, single cell analysis of LC3 fluorescent puncta, and Western blot,  each used in conjunction with a flux inhibitor to trap newly formed  autophagosomes in order to monitor mitophagy in neuronal cells.  ,  Context: distinct modes with different conductances and permeabilities when  heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When stimulated by potassium ions  (K(+)), Panx1 formed a high-conductance channel of ~500 pS that was permeable to  ATP. Various physiological stimuli can induce this ATP-permeable conformation of  the channel in several cell types. In contrast, the channel had a low  conductance (~50 pS) with no detectable ATP permeability when activated by  voltage in the absence of K(+). The two channel states were associated with  different reactivities of the terminal cysteine of Panx1 to thiol reagents,  suggesting different conformations. Single-particle electron microscopic analysis revealed that K(+) stimulated the formation of channels with a larger  pore diameter than those formed in the absence of K(+). These data suggest that  different stimuli lead to distinct channel structures with distinct biophysical  properties.

List R packages for lipidomics,"lipidr, IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures."," Context: The rapid evolution of mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics has enabled the  simultaneous measurement of numerous lipid classes. With lipidomics datasets  becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required  to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating  lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and  unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets.  lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for  targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically  inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names.

Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for  overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range  operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other  Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential  expression analysis and visualization.  ,  Context:  Since our last comprehensive review on multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based  shotgun lipidomics (Mass Spectrom. Rev. 24 (2005), 367), many new developments  in the field of lipidomics have occurred. These developments include new strategies and refinements for shotgun lipidomic approaches that use direct  infusion, including novel fragmentation strategies, identification of multiple  new informative dimensions for mass spectrometric interrogation, and the development of new bioinformatic approaches for enhanced identification and  quantitation of the individual molecular constituents that comprise each cell's  lipidome.

However, the poor  aqueous solubility of luteolin limits its clinical application. In the present  study, an approach towards chemoprevention was explored using liposomes to  deliver luteolin, and the antitumor efficacy was investigated in colorectal  carcinoma. The present findings demonstrated that luteolin was efficiently  encapsulated into liposomes with an encapsulation efficiency as high as 90%. The  particle size of the liposomal luteolin (Lipo‑Lut) and ζ‑potential were  optimized. In vitro studies demonstrated that, Lipo‑Lut had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth on the CT26 colorectal carcinoma cell line  compared with free luteolin (Free‑Lut). The in vivo study indicated that  Lipo‑Lut could achieve superior antitumor effects against CT26 tumor compared with luteolin alone. The present results suggested that liposome delivery of  luteolin improved solubility, bioavailability and may have potential  applications in chemoprevention in clinical settings.  ,  Context: (2)Physics Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina,  NC 27695, USA.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6," Context: OBJECTIVE: The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which  is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles  in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing. As RA patients might be treated  with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of  filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were  evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. METHODS: The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential  interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, were identified using  recombinant enzymes, human microsomes, and cell systems. Furthermore,  filgotinib's interaction potential with CYP3A4 was examined in an open-label study in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the impact of filgotinib  co-administration on the CYP3A4-sensitive substrate midazolam. The potential  interaction with the common RA drug methotrexate was investigated in a clinical  study in RA patients.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: sacubitril/valsartan, aspirin, or sildenafil. RESULTS: In the human mass balance study, mean total radioactivity recovered was  98.3% of the dose administered (53.1% and 45.2% excreted via urine and feces,  respectively). The main metabolic pathway of vericiguat is glucuronidation via  uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 and 1A1. In vitro studies  revealed a low risk of vericiguat acting as a perpetrator by inhibiting  cytochrome P450s, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms, or major  transport proteins, or by inducing cytochrome P450s. These observations were  supported by phase I drug-drug interaction studies. Phase I studies that assessed the propensity of vericiguat as a victim drug showed changes in the  range that did not warrant recommendations for dose adjustment in phase III. CONCLUSIONS: A low pharmacokinetic interaction potential of vericiguat was estimated from in vitro data and confirmed in vivo. Thus, vericiguat is suitable  for a patient population with multiple comorbidities requiring polypharmacy.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atemoya (Annona atemoya) is increasingly being  consumed worldwide because of its pleasant taste. However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.  ,  Context: focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR promotes cell survival by keeping p53 levels in check in progenitor cells. It also regulates posttranscriptional stability and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs, affecting a default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth regulatory proteins"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was  accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  mechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the  regulation of HuR during replicative senescence.  ,  Context: computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site  and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly  uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong  conservation of structure and sequence composition. Despite the fact that HuR  sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR  in regulating splicing. HuR sites in 3'-UTRs overlap extensively with predicted  microRNA target sites, suggesting interplay between the functions of HuR and  microRNAs. Network analysis showed that identified targets containing HuR  binding sites in the 3' UTR are highly interconnected.  ,  Context: increase in the level of HuA. Upregulation of HuA corresponds to previously  documented increases in cytokine expression which are due to increased mRNA  stability following T cell activation. Consistent with these findings, HuA was  down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.  ,  Context:  Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ","19884656, 20007147, 21890634, 9763509, 12730239, 23401122","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of budding yeast, suggesting that it plays a significant role in nucleosome positioning."," Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: minor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the  alpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the  positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between  histones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group  (that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at  the sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the  central part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the  positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these  nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either  an X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of  nucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA). The results presented  here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking  together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood.

In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the  intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an  early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of  desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  ,  Context: but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average  diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and  average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis  indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly,  but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated  that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all  are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.  ,  Context:  Transposable elements (TEs) are the main component of eukaryotic genomes.  Besides their impact on genome size, TEs are also functionally important as they  can alter gene expression and influence phenotypic variation. In plants, most top-down studies focus on extremely clear phenotypes such as the shape or the  color of individuals and do not explore fully the role of TEs in evolution.  Assessing the impact of TEs in a more systematic manner, however, requires identifying active TEs to further study their impact on phenotypes. In this  chapter, we describe an in planta approach that consists in activating TEs by  interfering with pathways involved in their silencing. It enables to directly  ,  Context:  A fraction of highly purified prolamellar bodies was isolated from etioplasts of  wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Starke II, Weibull), as previously described by  Ryberg and Sundqvist (1982, Physiol. Plant., 56, 125-132). Studies on the protein composition revealed that only one major polypeptide of an apparent  molecular weight of 36000 is present in the fraction of prolamellar bodies. This  polypeptide was identified as the NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. The highest specific activity of the enzyme in etiolated leaf tissue was confirmed  to be in the fraction of prolamellar bodies.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68. These lncRNAs contain consensus Sam68 binding sites."," Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: networks in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveals that many endogenous  noncoding RNA molecules, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), may play a  role in controlling the pluripotent state. We performed a genome-wide screen  that combined full-length mESC transcriptome genomic mapping data with chromatin  immunoprecipitation genomic location maps of the key mESC transcription factors  Oct4 and Nanog. We henceforth identified four mESC-expressed, conserved  lncRNA-encoding genes residing proximally to active genomic binding sites of  Oct4 and Nanog. Accordingly, these four genes have potential roles in  pluripotency. We show that two of these lncRNAs, AK028326 (Oct4-activated) and AK141205 (Nanog-repressed), are direct targets of Oct4 and Nanog. Most  importantly, we demonstrate that these lncRNAs are not merely controlled by mESC  transcription factors, but that they themselves regulate developmental state: knockdown and overexpression of these transcripts lead to robust changes in Oct4  and Nanog mRNA levels, in addition to alterations in cellular lineage-specific  gene expression and in the pluripotency of mESCs. We further characterize  ,  Context: differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated  JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to  chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2  revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an  important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of  MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin  distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by  which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment.  ,  Context: Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long  noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel,  increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and  functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To  enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have  developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in  eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry  contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization,  conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can  be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and  ,  Context: been largely underestimated. Amongst these multiple classes of ncRNAs, the long  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are apparently the most numerous and functionally  diverse. A small but growing number of lncRNAs have been experimentally studied,  and a view is emerging that these are key regulators of epigenetic gene  regulation in mammalian cells. LncRNAs have already been implicated in human  diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of  this emergent field. In this article, we review the catalogs of annotated  lncRNAs and the latest advances in our understanding of lncRNAs.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/solonas13/maw (free software  under the terms of the GNU GPL). CONTACT: alice.heliou@lix.polytechnique.fr or solon.pissis@kcl.ac.uk.  ,  Context: existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the  data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow  ,  Context: on a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata  (Crochemore et al., 1998).

RESULTS: Our contribution in this article is twofold: first, we bridge this  unpleasant gap by presenting an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see  text]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words based on the construction of suffix arrays; and second, we provide the respective  implementation of this algorithm. Experimental results, using real and synthetic  data, show that this implementation outperforms the one by Pinho et al.

Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome  organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3.," Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold  increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class  switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B  lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation  endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This  finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune  disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants,  identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. METHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the  TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274  healthy female controls.  ,  Context: The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating (Yaa) locus drives the transition to fatal  lupus nephritis when combined with B6.Sle1 in our C57BL/6J (B6)-congenic model  of systemic autoimmunity. We and others recently demonstrated that the  translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the  genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the  translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X  chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To  confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed  a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce  ","18606711, 30276444, 18088248, 29374079, 21396113, 18521959",The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).,"27347137, 16777955, 18521959, 25339659, 21396113, 25541140, 16709748, 25650422, 18606711, 18682521, 30276444, 29374079"
Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit proteins and NELL1/2.," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM  ,  Context: while limiting their peripheral toxicity. Such molecular vectors can pave the  way for the development of new classes of therapeutics, fighting against  protagonists of neoplastic development. In line with this concept, peptide  ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a  strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been  developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3)  receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic  pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med.  Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040). This compound has entered phase II clinical trials as an anti-angiogenic agent. Further studies have been directed to develop  molecular conjugates of the parent c[-RGDfK-] with conventional  chemotherapeutics or with labels for non-invasive imaging technologies. More recently, multimeric RGD containing compounds have been exploited to improve the  targeting potential as well as cell-membrane breaching, through  receptor-mediated endocytosis. The latter have been constructed on various  ,  Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates.

To explore which receptors involved the effects of PGI2 analogs on the expression of MIP-1α expression, I  prostanoid (IP) and E prostanoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-r receptor antagonists were used to pretreat THP-1 cells. Forskolin, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activator, was also used to  further confirm the cAMP involvement on the effect of PGI2 analogs in MIP-1α  production.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways and induces G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells, suggesting that it has anti-tumor activity."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Src has a critical role in tumor cell migration and invasion.  Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase  inhibitor. METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had received one prior  treatment and had measurable disease were enrolled in this phase 2 study.

This blockade results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss of cortisol-mediated suppression of"," Context: hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: olaparib and abiraterone (seven of which were related to treatment) and 13 (18%)  of 71 patients receiving placebo and abiraterone (one of which was related to  treatment). One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the olaparib  and abiraterone group. INTERPRETATION: Olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical  efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate  cancer compared with abiraterone alone. More serious adverse events were  observed in patients who received olaparib and abiraterone than abiraterone  alone. Our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might  provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss  of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH), providing a rationale for development of CYP17 inhibitors with increased  specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and VT-464) that can  potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids. In this article,  we review the development of abiraterone and other CYP17 inhibitors; recent  studies with abiraterone that inform our understanding of clinical parameters  such as drug effects on quality-of-life, potential early predictors of response,  and optimal sequencing of abiraterone with respect to other agents; and results of translational studies providing insights into resistance mechanisms to CYP17  inhibitors leading to clinical trials with drug combinations designed to prolong  abiraterone benefit or restore abiraterone activity.  ,  Context: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease where the previous concept of  ""hormone resistance"" has been changed by a new generation of hormonal therapies  that have proven efficacy in the castration-resistant setting. The fact is that  androgens play a crucial role in the whole clinical course of prostate cancer,  even when a patient meets castration-resistance criteria. The development of  abiraterone showed how important and clinically meaningful can be to achieve the lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression,  mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted  with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new  antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual  mechanism of action (galeterone).

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"Waardenburg's syndrome and Horner's syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum. In Waardenburg's syndrome, it is typically characterized by complete iris heterochromia, while in Horner's syndrome, it is often"," Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well  described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated  with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare.  METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in  ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic  testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed. RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement. CONCLUSION: Acquired heterochromia can occur in adults. The partial response to  hydroxyamphetamine in the two cases presented may reflect trans-synaptic  degeneration of the postganglionic neuron. A reduction in trophic influences on  ,  Context: characteristic facies and deafness. The second case is an example of  Waardenburg's type I (with dystopia canthorum) with complete iris heterochromia  and characteristic facies. Bilateral glaucoma was also present in the second  case. Previously unrecognized details of iris architecture in Waardenburg's  syndrome are described. Pigmentation anomalies of the skin are also discussed.  It is hypothesized that the ocular pigmentary disturbance in Waardenburg's  syndrome is widespread and involves the hyperchromic as well as the hypochromic  areas of the eyes. A possible association with glaucoma might be explained by  such a hypothesis.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: The purpose of this study is to report a new and promising method for changing  iris color in a sectorial heterochromia iridis patient. A 22-year-old man with a  complaint of innate color disparity between his eyes presented to our clinic to  seek medical advice. He underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination,  including visual acuity, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  measurements, endothelial cell count, and evaluation of iridocorneal angle. The  causes of acquired heterochromia were excluded. After a detailed explanation of  the procedure and probable side effects, the patient underwent an application  with a laser device that produces a frequency-doubled 532 nm wavelength Nd:YAG laser beam with a spot size of 400 μm (selective laser trabeculoplasty laser  device). The heterochromic areas (brown) were divided into zones and a gradual  treatment pattern was performed to avoid inflammation and flare. The patient showed no side effects such as increased intraocular pressure, pain, corneal  edema, hypopyon formation, decrease in visual acuity, synechia, or iris defect.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics) have been developed that activate TRβ and are selectively taken up and/or activated by the liver. Such compounds stimulate hepatic LDL receptors, cholesterol elimination as bile acids and cholesterol, and presumably promote"," Context: the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2)  release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize how thyroid hormones exert their effects on  lipid metabolism through specific interaction with their nuclear receptors, to  review studies of the effects of new and selective thyromimetic drugs in animals  and humans and to identify important questions for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid  hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRβ is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol  and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TRα is most important in fat, muscle, and  heart. Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics, tiromes) have been developed that activate TRβ and are selectively taken up and/or activated by the liver. Such  compounds stimulate hepatic LDL receptors, cholesterol elimination as bile acids  and cholesterol, and presumably promote reverse cholesterol transport. In  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate  and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  3,5-Dimethyl-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine (DIMIT) and  3,5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyroacetic acid (IpTA2), two thyroid hormone analogs,  have been tested in genetically obese Zucker rats and their lean littermates, in comparison with thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) for their thyromimetic  activities on body weight gain and lipid levels in serum and liver. The  compounds were administered for 9 weeks by orogastric tube to 6- to 8-week-old animals. While body weight gain remained practically unchanged in the lean rats,  it decreased significantly in the obese individuals, especially with IpTA2.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of  S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.  ,  Context:  The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie  ,  Context: The rate of proteolysis is an important determinant of the intracellular protein  content. Part of the degradation of intracellular proteins occurs in the  lysosomes and is mediated by macroautophagy. In liver, macroautophagy is very  active and almost completely accounts for starvation-induced proteolysis.  Factors inhibiting this process include amino acids, cell swelling and insulin.  In the mechanisms controlling macroautophagy, protein phosphorylation plays an  important role. Activation of a signal transduction pathway, ultimately leading  to phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, accompanies inhibition of  macroautophagy. Components of this pathway may include a heterotrimeric Gi3-protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase. Recent evidence  indicates that lysosomal protein degradation can be selective and occurs via  ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and protor."," Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  ,  Context:  Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.  However, the mechanism by which they are recognized and targeted to the exosome  is not fully understood. Here we report that the MTREC complex, which has recently been shown to promote degradation of meiotic mRNAs and regulatory  ncRNAs, is also the major nuclear exosome targeting complex for CUTs and  unspliced pre-mRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets  these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has  only a minor role in this process. The MTREC complex physically interacts with  ,  Context: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a component of two large  complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth  and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell  proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor  is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in  controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on  lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell  proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a  was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314,  which resulted in its nuclear accumulation.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"There is no national screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. The National Screening Council has assessed that screening should not be carried out, and this recommendation has been generally accepted. However, some men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are"," Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context:  Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National  Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. A number of  randomised controlled trials are under way to establish the place of routine screening of asymptomatic men. We report the possible practice of prostate  cancer screening with reference to the appropriate age range for screening, how  to screen for prostate cancer and how often, and what constitutes an abnormal result that would merit referral to a urologist for a prostate biopsy.  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening. CONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the  United Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice  ,  Context:  National guidance (executive letter) EL(97)12 stated that population screening  should not be provided by the NHS, or be offered to the public until there is  effective screening technology for prostate cancer. The study set out to determine the views of general practitioners and, indirectly, their practice  staff on prostate cancer screening in primary care upon receiving EL(97)12. This  postal questionnaire survey reveals that 81% (95% CI 75% to 87%) of responding general practitioners in North Staffordshire agreed with EL(97)12 and one in ten  said that the executive letter changed their views, suggesting that such  national guidance has an effect.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases. Selenium-dependent enzymes have modifying effects on the immune system, and even mild selenium deficiency can play a role in these diseases."," Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are  mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the  glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine  ,  Context: hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: Thus, Sepp1 serves in homeostasis and distribution of selenium. Mice with  deletion of Sepp1 suffer greater morbidity and mortality from infection with  Trypanosoma congolense than do wild-type mice. Mice that express only the  N-terminal domain of Sepp1 have the same severity of illness as wild-type mice,  indicating that the protective function of Sepp1 against the infection resides  in the N-terminal (redox) domain. Thus, Sepp1 has several functions. In  addition, plasma Sepp1 concentration falls in selenium deficiency and,  therefore, it can be used as an index of selenium nutritional status.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons. We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.  ,  Context: discrimination, and dynamic programming (DP) was employed to guarantee optimal  solutions would be found. The resultant program, EXALIN, performed better than  other popular tools tested under a wide range of conditions that included  detection of micro-exons and human-mouse cross-species comparisons.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a critical role in mediating cardiac  contractility and its function is abnormal in the diabetic heart. However, the  mechanisms underlying SR dysfunction in the diabetic heart are not clear.  Because protein phosphorylation regulates SR function, this study examined the  phosphorylation state of phospholamban, a key SR protein that regulates SR  calcium (Ca2+) uptake in the heart. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley  rats by an injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg kg(-1) i.v.), and the animals  were humanely killed after 6 weeks and cardiac SR function was examined.  Depressed cardiac performance was associated with reduced SR Ca2+-uptake activity in diabetic animals. The reduction in SR Ca2+-uptake was consistent  with a significant decrease in the level of SR Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2a)  protein. The level of phospholamban (PLB) protein was also decreased, however, the ratio of PLB to SERCA2a was increased in the diabetic heart. Depressed SR  Ca2+-uptake was also due to a reduction in the phosphorylation of PLB by the  Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and cAMP-dependent protein  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Calcium (Ca2+) handling proteins are known to play a pivotal role in  the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy. However little is known about early  changes in the diabetic heart and the impact of insulin treatment (Ins). METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats treated with or without insulin (ZDF ± Ins,  n = 13) and lean littermates (controls, n = 7) were sacrificed at the age of  19 weeks. ZDF + Ins (n = 6) were treated with insulin for the last 6 weeks of life. Gene expression of Ca2+ ATPase in the cardiac sarcoplasmatic reticulum  (SERCA2a, further abbreviated as SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) were determined  by northern blotting. Ca2+ transport of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) was  ,  Context: glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and total lipids. Also, the functional  depression seen in diabetic rat hearts was present despite the treatment.  However, depression of calcium uptake and elevation of long chain acyl  carnitines seen in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) prepared from diabetic rat hearts  could be prevented by the treatment. As triiodothyronine (T3) treatment has been  shown to normalize depression of cardiac myosin ATPase in diabetic rats, we  repeated the study using a combination of T3 (30 micrograms kg-1 day-1 sc daily)  and methyl palmoxirate. While diabetic rats treated with T3 alone did not show  significant improvement of myocardial function when compared with untreated diabetics, the function of those treated with both T3 and methyl palmoxirate was  not significantly different from that in control rat hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED  AT 250 WORDS)  ","3850773, 22590623, 15362510, 18570267, 22621761, 2934121",Yes.,"8864644, 8761317, 3384188, 22402252, 3850773, 10359740"
What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.," Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents. Both  preclinical and clinical studies of this drug provide the significant protection  of hematopoietic progentitors from a broad range of cytotoxic agents such as  cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vinblastine, carboplatin, mitomycin-C, fotemustine,  doxorubicin, daunorubicin and radiation as well. Moreover, this drug can protect  other normal organs or tissues including kidney, salivary gland, liver, heart,  lung and small intestine. Amifostine is quite safe, the two major side effects  are vomiting and hypotension, and the minor effects are flushing, sneezing,  dizziness, chills, metallic taste etc. The drug was approved by the FDA of U.S.A. for use as a cytoprotectant in cyclophosphamide and cisplatin treatment  for advanced ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer.  ,  Context: attention for their potential roles in insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.  FTY720/fingolimod, a prodrug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is  phosphorylated in vivo to its active phosphorylated form by sphingosine kinase 2  and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide  biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks  of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and its interactions with chromatin modifiers and transcription factor families explain its role in genome-wide regulation. Mediator's essential function is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while Tail and CKM"," Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively.

We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context: The long non-coding RNA Xist directs a remarkable instance of developmentally  regulated, epigenetic change known as X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI). By  spreading in cis across the X chromosome from which it is expressed, Xist RNA  facilitates the creation of a heritably silent, heterochromatic nuclear  territory that displays a three-dimensional structure distinct from that of the  active X chromosome. How Xist RNA attaches to and propagates across a chromosome  and its influence over the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the inactive X  are aspects of XCI that have remained largely unclear. Here, we discuss studies  that have made significant contributions towards answering these open questions.  ,  Context:  The role of the zinc finger protein CTCF in organizing the genome within the  nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both  CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also  mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different  domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting  them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears  that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Yes, colistin is mentioned as an antibiotic in multiple contexts, specifically as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii infection and as a potential effective drug candidate against antibiotic-resistant UTIs."," Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: using the Centor scoring system and patients meeting three or all four of the  criteria were offered a throat swab test for Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield  group A streptococci. Patients with a positive throat swab test were offered  antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Following screening by pharmacy staff, 149/367 (40.6%) patients were  eligible for throat swab testing. Of these, only 36/149 (24.2%) were positive  for group A streptococci. Antibiotics were supplied to 9.8% (n = 36/367) of all  patients accessing the service. Just under half of patients that were not  showing signs of a bacterial infection (60/123, 48.8%) would have gone to their general practitioner if the service had not been available. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that it is feasible to deliver a  community-pharmacy-based screening and treatment service using point-of-care testing. This type of service has the potential to support the antimicrobial  resistance agenda by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and inappropriate  antibiotic consumption.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: three proteins, of which MbF1-2 provided over 50% of the antimicrobial activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study showed significant antimicrobial  activity from several proteins present in the honey of M. beecheii.  Interestingly, the non-glycosylated protein fraction demonstrated antihaemolytic  activity and adversely affected the expression of virulence genes in Escherichia  coli O157:H7; these proteins have the potential to be used in developing  therapeutic agents against this bacterium.  ,  Context: evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating COPD exacerbations in  the community, but this is most convincing in patients with severe airflow  obstruction and there is uncertainty regarding the value of antibiotics in  patients with mild airflow obstruction. Treatment with antibiotics is usually  recommended for patients who have an increase in sputum volume, sputum purulence  and breathlessness, but the most important determinant of bacterial infection  appears to be purulence. There is some evidence to suggest that the decision to  use antibiotics can be guided by the use of procalcitonin, although this needs  to be confirmed in further studies. Newer broad-spectrum antibiotics may be more effective than older antibiotics but, because of concerns regarding antibiotic  resistance, it may be appropriate to reserve them for patients at highest risk  of treatment failure. A number of studies suggest that antibiotic courses of 5 days in duration may be as effective as those for 7 days or more in patients  with mild-to-moderate exacerbations of COPD. Guidelines do not recommend the use  of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest  ","23342992, 30088449, 27439523, 24392752, 33151599, 20477251","Yes, colistin is an antibiotic.","33057672, 30088449, 30892111"
