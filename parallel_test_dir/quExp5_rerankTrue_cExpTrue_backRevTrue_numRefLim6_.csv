What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode mutually exclusive cohesin subunits, and retain partially overlapping functions. They are involved in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis and meiosis."," Context:  STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins.

To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement  ,  Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.

PATIENTS: Thirty-six age-, sex-, disease-duration- and disability-matched  patients with Gd-PSP (n = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (a tauopathy, n =  9), Parkinson disease (a synucleinopathy, n = 9) and controls (n = 9). SETTINGS: Tertiary-care academic hospital. RESULTS: REM sleep behavior disorder was found in 78% patients with Gd-PSP (43%  of patients reported having this disorder several years before the onset of parkinsonism), 44% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, 33% of  patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and no controls.

Patients with LRRK2 mutations account for  approximately 2-13% of ADPD and 0.5-3% of sporadic PD. Genetically, LRRK2  mutations have been distributed worldwide with some ethnic differences by single  founder effect such as G2019S, R1441G, and G2385R variants. LRRK2 G2385R was  reported to be a risk factor for sporadic PD in Asia. Clinically, most patients  with LRRK2 mutations develop typical idiopathic PD, however, variable clinical  features and pathologies such as diffuse Lewy body disease, multiple system  atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have  been reported. Although Lewy bodies have been considered as a pathological hallmark for sporadic PD classically, some FPD and sporadic PD patients with  heterozygous LRRK2 mutations or homozygous parkin mutations have no Lewy bodies.  On the other hand, LRRK2 was reported as a component of Lewy bodies. Based on the variability, multifunction of LRRK2 such as phosphorylation of other  proteins, especially, alpha-synuclein and tau, have been suggested. As  interaction of Parkin and LRRK2 was reported, interaction and intersection among  ,  Context:  Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score is a simple but useful screening tool for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients from a sleep clinic in China. It has also been validated for identifying individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep," Context: male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The  NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95%  CI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.  INTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement  score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered  breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal  recording.

Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep.

List markers for autophagy.,Markers for autophagy include:  * LC3II protein * Monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-labeled vacuoles * Acridine orange staining * Beclin-1 expression * p62/SQ," Context: Resveratrol has many biological effects, including anti-tumor, antiviral  activities, and vascular protection. Recent studies have suggested that  resveratrol exert its antitumor effects through induction of autophagy by an  unknown mechanism. In this study, we investigated the involvement of autophagy  in resveratrol-induced cell death and its potential molecular mechanisms in A549  human lung adnocarcinoma cells. Resveratrol-induced growth inhibition and cell  death was assessed by MTT and clonogenic assays. Activation of autophagy was  characterized by monodansylcadaverine, transmission electron microscopy, and  expression of autophagy marker protein LC3. Western blot analysis was used to study the cell signals involved in the mechanisms of autophagic death.  Intracellular free calcium was detected with Fura2-AM staining. Our results  indicated that resveratrol induced A549 cell death was mediated by autophagy. 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, suppressed resveratrol-induced  autophagic cell death, and knockdown of autophagy-related genes Atg5 and  Beclin-1 with siRNAs reversed RSV-induced cell death.

Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal self-digested process that  can either promote cell survival or programmed cell death, but the role of  autophagy in mediating γ-tocotrienol-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer is  not presently completely understood.

Results also showed  that γ-tocotrienol treatment induced an increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein, 1A/1B-light chain 3, from its cytosolic form  (LC3B-I) to its lipidated form (LC3B-II), increased Beclin-1 levels, and  increased acridine orange staining as determined by flow cytometry analysis, providing further evidence of γ-tocotrienol-induced autophagy in these mammary  cancer cell lines. In contrast, similar treatment with γ-tocotrienol was not  found to increase autophagy marker expression in immortalized mouse (CL-S1) and  ,  Context:  Autophagy has been predominantly studied as a nonselective self-digestion  process that recycles macromolecules and produces energy in response to  starvation. However, autophagy independent of nutrient status has long been known to exist. Recent evidence suggests that this form of autophagy enforces  intracellular quality control by selectively disposing of aberrant protein  aggregates and damaged organelles--common denominators in various forms of neurodegenerative diseases. By definition, this form of autophagy, termed  quality-control (QC) autophagy, must be different from nutrient-regulated  autophagy in substrate selectivity, regulation and function.

Recent methodologies have enabled in-depth  characterization of circRNAs for identification and potential functions.  CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA.

Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists.

We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context:  Origin licensing builds a fundamental basis for genome stability in DNA  replication. Recent studies reported that deregulation of origin licensing is  associated with replication stress in precancerous lesions. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an  essential role in origin licensing. Previously, we reported the recovery of the  first viable Mcm mutant allele (named Mcm4(Chaos3)) in mice. The Mcm4(Chaos3) allele destabilizes the MCM2-7 complex, leading to chromosome instability and  the formation of spontaneous tumors in Mcm4(Chaos3) homozygous mice.

This influence has helped shape the  genomes of humans and other multicellular organisms and can affect the  distribution of mutations in somatic cells. It is also becoming clear that the  replication-timing program is deregulated in many disease states, including  cancer. Aberrant DNA replication timing is associated with changes in gene  expression, changes in epigenetic modifications and an increased frequency of  structural rearrangements. Furthermore, certain replication timing changes can directly lead to overt genomic instability and may explain unique mutational  signatures that are present in cells that have undergone the recently described  processes of ""chromothripsis"" and ""kataegis"". In this review, we will discuss how the normal replication timing program, as well as how alterations to this  program, can contribute to the evolution of the genomic landscape in normal and  cancerous cells.  ,  Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, immediate-early genes (IEGs) create a ripple effect of transcription. Transcriptional activation of IEGs is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes, and even in surrounding intergenic regions, transcriptional activation takes place"," Context: primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.  Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all  transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context:  Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation. As transcription of IE genes does not require  prior viral protein synthesis, this class of genes is experimentally defined by their transcription following primary infection or reactivation in the presence  of inhibitors of protein synthesis. This chapter describes an approach to  identify IE genes in a novel herpesvirus genome. Transcription of IE genes is selectively induced with sodium butyrate in the presence of the protein  synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The transcripts of the induced genes are  identified by using a cDNA subtraction-based method of gene expression  screening.  ,  Context: The ubiquitous transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is known to have a  fundamental role in normal biologic processes such as embryogenesis,  differentiation, replication, and cellular proliferation. YY1 exerts its effects  on genes involved in these processes via its ability to initiate, activate, or  repress transcription depending upon the context in which it binds. Mechanisms  of action include direct activation or repression, indirect activation or repression via cofactor recruitment, or activation or repression by disruption  of binding sites or conformational DNA changes. YY1 activity is regulated by  transcription factors and cytoplasmic proteins that have been shown to abrogate or completely inhibit YY1-mediated activation or repression; however, these  mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Since expression and function of  YY1 are known to be intimately associated with progression through phases of the  ,  Context: We have investigated beta interferon (IFN-beta) and IFN-alpha4 gene expression  and activation of related transcription factors in mouse cytomegalovirus  (MCMV)-infected fibroblasts. mRNA analysis demonstrated an initial phase of IFN  gene induction upon MCMV infection, which was followed by a sustained  MCMV-mediated simultaneous downregulation of IFN-beta and IFN-alpha4 gene  expression. The induction of IFN transcription resulted from the activation of  the components of the IFN-beta enhanceosome, i.e. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3,  nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun.  Activation of the transcription factors occurred rapidly and in a sequential order upon infection, but only lasted a while. As a consequence, IFN-alpha/beta  gene expression became undetectable 6 h post-infection and throughout the MCMV  replication cycle. This effect is based on an active interference since restimulation of IFN gene induction by further external stimuli (e.g. Sendai  virus infection) was completely abolished. This inhibition required MCMV gene  expression and was not observed in cells infected with UV-inactivated MCMV  ,  Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs.

Pol II pauses in the proximity of the  promoter on a large fraction of transcribed genes. Transcription initiation and elongation of transcripts are under distinct control. Induced gene expression  can thus be due to enhanced initiation and/or stimulated elongation. Pausing and  resumption of the elongation of transcripts is under the control of transcription elongation factors.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Gait disturbances, dementia, and urinary incontinence."," Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: operation. In these cases, we performed a preoperative and postoperative survey  of sexual activity. RESULTS: In the preoperative period, all 28 patients reported having no sexual  activity or arousal, from 2 to 4 years before the operation. Following shunt  placement, 22/28 (78.5%) of patients regained variable sexual desire within a  period ranging from 3 to 8 weeks, affording normal sexual activity with their  partner.  CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction can be part of the very early clinical  background in patients with Hakim's triad and neuroradiological imaging  compatible with chronic hydrocephalus. Restoration of sexual ability and arousal should be considered among the postoperative goals in these cases, together with  improvements in cognition, gait, and urinary continence.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence.

Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to  decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic  condition that was first described in 1983.

They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast  cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified. Circ-Seq  was then applied to a larger cohort of breast cancer samples (n = 885) provided  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types.

In  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that,  unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene  regulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an  increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs  are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have  been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization.  Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: In addition to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs),  circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous RNAs with various functions, which have  recently become a research hotspot. CircRNAs are a kind of closed circular RNA molecule widely existing in transcriptomes. Due to lack of free ends, they are  not easily cleaved by RNase R, thus avoiding degradation. They are more stable  than linear RNAs. METHODS: Data were collected through PubMed. The following search terms were used: ""circular RNA,"" ""circRNA,"" ""cancer,"" ""mechanism,"" ""biogenesis,""  ""biomarker,"" ""diagnosis."" Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Most circRNAs express tissue/developmental stage specificity. Moreover,  ,  Context:  Most RNAs generated by the human genome have no protein-coding ability and are  termed non-coding RNAs. Among these include circular RNAs, which include exonic  circular RNAs (circRNA), mainly found in the cytoplasm, and intronic RNAs (ciRNA), predominantly detected in the nucleus. The biological functions of  circular RNAs remain largely unknown, although ciRNAs have been reported to  promote gene transcription, while circRNAs may function as microRNA sponges.

Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group.

The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is a hyperinflammatory condition with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, characterized by persistent fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory"," Context:  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized condition in which  children with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection present with a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan involvement, and elevated  inflammatory markers. These symptoms and the associated laboratory values  strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII  molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based  computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction. Recommended treatments for MIS-C include intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, and inotropic or vasopressor support. For refractory patients,  monoclonal antibody to interleukin-6 receptor (tocilizumab), interleukin-1  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Recently, severe manifestations associated with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  have been recognized. Analysis of studies for this novel syndrome is needed for a better understanding of effective management among affected children. METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic  electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers  (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for  ,  Context: Most of the reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) in children reported mild-to-moderate disease manifestations.  However, recent reports explored a rare pediatric multisystem syndrome possibly  associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C).The study prospectively enrolled 5 patients with clinical and  laboratory evidence of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Their clinical  presentation, laboratory, and outcome were described.All patients shared similar  clinical presentations such as persistent documented fever for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory  markers (CRP, ESR, and ferritin).

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase that regulates tubulin acetylation. Additionally, ATAT1 (α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1) and MEC-17 are also"," Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ,  Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context:  Cell motility and adhesion involves dynamic microtubule (MT)  acetylation/deacetylation, a process regulated by enzymes as HDAC6, a major  cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase. We identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a key novel stimulator of HDAC6. GRK2, which levels inversely  correlate with the extent of α-tubulin acetylation in epithelial cells and  fibroblasts, directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate α-tubulin deacetylase activity. Remarkably, phosphorylation of GRK2 itself at  S670 specifically potentiates its ability to regulate HDAC6. GRK2 and HDAC6  colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3).

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"NOMe-seq measures nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation genome-wide using less than 1 million cells, while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand."," Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing. Open chromatin regions allow regulatory elements  such as transcription factors and polymerases to bind for gene expression while  closed chromatin regions prevent the activity of transcriptional machinery.  Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual  templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and  methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling  chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Therefore,  there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The predominant model for regulation of gene expression through DNA  methylation is an inverse association in which increased methylation results in  decreased gene expression levels. However, recent studies suggest that the  relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and expression is more  complex. RESULTS: Systems genetic approaches for examining relationships between gene  expression and methylation array data were used to find both negative and positive associations between these levels. A weighted correlation network  analysis revealed that i) both transcriptome and methylome are organized in  modules, ii) co-expression modules are generally not preserved in the methylation data and vice-versa, and iii) highly significant correlations exist  between co-expression and co-methylation modules, suggesting the existence of  factors that affect expression and methylation of different modules (i.e., trans  ,  Context: Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species  according to the age and the sex of the individuals. We also found extensive  species-level divergence in patterns of DNA methylation and that hundreds of  genes exhibit significantly lower levels of promoter methylation in the human  brain than in the chimpanzee brain. Furthermore, we investigated the functional  consequences of methylation differences in humans and chimpanzees by integrating  data on gene expression generated with next-generation sequencing methods, and  we found a strong relationship between differential methylation and gene  expression. Finally, we found that differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders,  psychological disorders, and cancers. Our results demonstrate that differential  DNA methylation might be an important molecular mechanism driving gene-expression divergence between human and chimpanzee brains and might  potentially contribute to the evolution of disease vulnerabilities.

Alterations in DNA methylation are established  contributors to inter-individual phenotypic variation and have been associated  with disease susceptibility. The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA  methylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is  largely unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation across the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the  serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4/SERT) and the X-linked monoamine oxidase A  gene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs and 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n=182).

We observed that methylation probes associated  with expression in cis were more likely to be located outside CpG islands,  whereas specificity for CpG island shores was present when methylation, associated with expression, was under local genetic control.

Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking  anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of  nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and  can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted.

Cypher/ZASP is a  cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its  encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of  the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To explore the role of Cypher in myocardium and to better  understand molecular mechanisms by which mutations in cypher cause  cardiomyopathy, we utilized a conditional approach to knockout Cypher, specially in either developing or adult myocardium.

However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1.

Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia.  Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication.

Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation.

H3K79 was dimethylated in a  region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating  DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator  that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme  responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication  although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the  absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect  regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates  with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to  prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: complex containing EZH2, EED and SUZ12, but is independent of the catalytic SET  domain of EZH2. Using a heterologous reporter system, we show that transient  recruitment of the PRC2 complex to chromatin, upstream of the transcriptional  start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during  subsequent cell divisions. Thus, we suggest that once the H3K27me3 is  established, it recruits the PRC2 complex to maintain the mark at sites of DNA  replication, leading to methylation of H3K27 on the daughter strands during  incorporation of newly synthesized histones. This mechanism ensures maintenance  of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark in proliferating cells, not only during DNA replication when histones synthesized de novo are incorporated, but also outside  S phase, thereby preserving chromatin structure and transcriptional programs.  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.

The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence.

However, it is mentioned that all 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were"," Context: due to complete loss of wild type allele. MASI was a frequent event in mutant  EGFR (75%) and was due mainly to CNGs, while MASI, also frequent in mutant KRAS  (58%), was mainly due to UPD. Mutant: wild type allelic ratios at the genomic  level were precisely maintained after transcription. KRAS mutations or CNGs were  significantly associated with increased ras GTPase activity, as measured by  ELISA, and the two molecular changes were synergistic. Of 237 lung  adenocarcinoma tumors, the small number with both KRAS mutation and CNG were  associated with shortened survival. CONCLUSIONS: MASI is frequently present in mutant EGFR and KRAS tumor cells, and is associated with increased mutant allele transcription and gene activity. The  frequent finding of mutations, CNGs and MASI occurring together in tumor cells  indicates that these three genetic alterations, acting together, may have a greater role in the development or maintenance of the malignant phenotype than  any individual alteration.  ,  Context: level were precisely maintained after transcription.

Of these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the  primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the  index tumor, indicating accumulation of de novo mutations during therapy.  Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the 3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of  the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2, and NUFIP1) had high level of  expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential oncogenic driver roles of  these mutated genes. Among them, the druggable G-protein coupled receptor LPAR1  was highly expressed in all tumors. Cells expressing the LPAR1 R163W mutant  demonstrated a significantly increased motility through elevated Rho signaling, but had no effect on growth. Therefore, this study highlights the need for  multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and  combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of  expressed driver mutations.  ,  Context: METHODS: The genetic analysis was performed using high resolution melting  analysis. The Human Progranulin ELISA Kit was used in order to determine PGRN  expression levels in the plasma samples.  RESULTS: The three patients carrying the genetic variation showed three final  different clinical diagnosis, respectively behavioral frontotemporal dementia,  semantic dementia, and corticobasal syndrome, thus underlining the clinical  heterogeneity typically associated with GRN mutations. All cases shared similar  plasma PGRN levels that resulted intermediate between those measured in controls  and in GRN null mutation carriers, showing a partial reduction of the protein in plasma. Moreover, according to the bioinformatics software, the Cys139Arg  variation causes a decreased stability of the structure of the protein. CONCLUSION: We describe three new patients affected by neurological syndromes included in the clinical spectrum of FTLD carrying the Cys139Arg genetic  variant, thus suggesting a possible implication in the pathogenesis of FTLD.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes.

METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution.

The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints.

In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF (also known as PCDHGC4) causes Waardenburg Syndrome type 2 (WS2).," Context: involving crosslinked DNA at stalled replication forks. Depletion of SLX4, which  interacts with multiple nucleases and has been recently identified as a Holliday  junction resolvase, results in increased sensitivity of the cells to DNA  crosslinking agents. Here we report the identification of biallelic SLX4  mutations in two individuals with typical clinical features of Fanconi anemia  and show that the cellular defects in these individuals' cells are complemented  by wildtype SLX4, demonstrating that biallelic mutations in SLX4 (renamed here  as FANCP) cause a new subtype of Fanconi anemia, Fanconi anemia-P.  ,  Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG.

Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a  biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex contains at least nine subunits with molecular weights ranging from 33K to 200K, including CRSP33, CRSP150, CRSP p200 (also known as TRIP2/PBP), CRSP34"," Context: C/EBPbeta is an intrinsically repressed transcription factor that regulates  genes involved in differentiation, proliferation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis.  C/EBPbeta acts as a repressor that is turned into an activator by the Ras  oncoprotein through phosphorylation of a MAPK site. C/EBPbeta activation is  accompanied by a conformational change. Active and repressive C/EBPbeta  interacts with multisubunit Mediator complexes through the CRSP130/Sur2 subunit.  The CRSP130/Sur2 subunit is common to two distinct types of Mediator complexes,  characterized by CRSP70 and CDK8 proteins as transcriptionally active and  inactive Mediator, respectively. Knockdown of CRSP130/Sur2 prevents Mediator binding and transactivation through C/EBPbeta. Oncogenic Ras signaling or  activating mutations in C/EBPbeta selects the transcriptionally active Mediator  complex that also associates with RNA polymerase II. These results show that a Ras-induced structural alteration of C/EBPbeta determines differential gene  activation through selective interaction with distinct Mediator complexes.  ,  Context:  The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Using EM and single-particle  reconstruction techniques, we recently completed a structural analysis of CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  ,  Context:  Human MED26 was originally purified in the cofactor required for the Sp1  activation complex (CRSP) as a 70-kDa component named CRSP70. This polypeptide  was specific to metazoans and the “small” form of the Mediator complex. We report here that a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of MED26 similarly  interacts with other components of the core Drosophila Mediator complex but not  with the kinase module and is recruited to genes upon activation. Using a null allele of Med26, we show that Med26 is required for organismal viability but not  for cell proliferation or survival. Clones lacking Med26 in the wing disc lead  to loss of the adult wing margin and reduced expression of genes involved in  ,  Context: Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors such as Sp1 requires  TFIID, but the identity of other necessary cofactors has remained unknown. Here  we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the  TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies  a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately  700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K.  Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of  the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in  yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new  proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor  TFIIS. Immunodepletion studies confirm that these subunits have an essential cofactor function. The presence of common subunits in distinct cofactor  complexes suggests a combinatorial mechanism of co-activator assembly during  transcriptional activation.  ,  Context: The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins.

Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically AMPK-α2 isoform associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP  kinases. Although stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta, p46 SAPKgamma  (JNK1) or p38 MAP kinases is abolished upon co-transfection with increasing  amounts of M3/6 plasmid, epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1 is remarkably  insensitive even to the highest levels of M3/6 expression obtained. In contrast  to M3/6, the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 is selective for inactivation of  ERK family MAP kinases. Low level expression of MKP-3 blocks totally epidermal  growth factor-stimulated ERK1, whereas stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta  and p38 MAP kinases is inhibited only partially under identical conditions. Selective regulation by M3/6 and MKP-3 was also observed upon chronic MAP kinase  activation by constitutive p21(ras) GTPases. Hence, although M3/6 expression  effectively blocked p54 SAPKbeta activation by p21(rac) (G12V), ERK1 activated by p21(ras) (G12V) was insensitive to this phosphatase. ERK1 activation by  oncogenic p21(ras) was, however, blocked totally by co-expression of MKP-3. This  is the first report demonstrating reciprocally selective inhibition of different  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,PAPOLA/PAP has a multifaceted post-translational regulation and is involved in polyadenylation. It also has translational regulation through two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' untranslated region (UTR," Context: Pcf11p, a new protein called Clp1p, and remarkably, the major poly(A)-binding  protein Pab1p. Extracts from strains where the PAB1 gene is mutated or deleted  are active for cleavage but generate transcripts bearing abnormally long poly(A)  tracts. Complementation with recombinant Pab1p not only restores the length of  the poly(A) tails to normal, but also triggers a poly(A) shortening activity. In  addition, a monoclonal Pab1p antibody prevents the formation of poly(A) tails in  extracts or in a reconstituted system. Our data support the notion that Pab1p is  involved in the length control of the poly(A) tails of yeast mRNAs and define a  new essential function for Pab1p in the formation of mature mRNAs.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is known to exist in  five different isoforms. PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the  nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus,  PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively  studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly  defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa  and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect  on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and  ,  Context:  Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated  mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted  post-translational regulation. The possibility of translational regulation of this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  ,  Context: PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail.

Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect  on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as  observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In  addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected  cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated  p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Whether routine screening for depression among nonpregnant women  of reproductive age improves identification and treatment of the disorder  remains unclear.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"No specific organ is mentioned in the provided text as being constructed using 3D printing technology. However, it does mention that the ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for clinical implant"," Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the  C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group P3(2) with unit-cell parameters a = 67.2, b = 67.2, c = 257.5 Å. The Matthews  coefficient was determined to be 3.41 Å(3) Da(-1) with two molecules in the  asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by the single-anomalous  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: A genome must locate its coding genes on the chromosomes in a meaningful manner  with the help of natural selection, but the mechanism of gene order evolution is  poorly understood. To explore the role of selection in shaping the current order  of coding genes and their cis-regulatory elements, a comparative genomic  approach was applied to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close  relatives. S. cerevisiae have experienced a whole-genome duplication followed by an extensive reorganization process of gene order, during which a number of new  adjacent gene pairs appeared. We found that the proportion of new adjacent gene  pairs in divergent orientation is significantly reduced, suggesting that such new divergent gene pairs may be disfavored most likely because their  coregulation may be deleterious. It is also found that such new divergent gene  pairs have particularly long intergenic regions. These observations suggest that  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data  indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism.

The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal cancer origin.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The fungicide agents are a key component in the fruits and vegetables  production. The Iprodione residues are one of the pesticide more frequently  found in food products. The available data about the cytotoxicity of iprodione  and its metabolites are scarce and do not allow characterization of its  genotoxic potential and define the risk assessment.The human larynx epidermoid  carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) has been shown to be sensitive to the toxic effects of xenobiotics of different origin and have been often used in citotoxicity and  genotoxicity studies. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the induction of  genotoxicity and the role of oxidative stress in HEp-2cell line by exposure to the IP. The MTT test for viability resulted in CL50 85.86 (77.05-95.68) μg/mL of  Iprodione. On the basis of this result, we proceeded to expose the cells to the  sublethal concentrations (below the CL50) during 24 h to analyze the mitotic  ,  Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation. However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we  investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs  via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal  xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal  cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and  matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were subcultured, purified, and verified by immunofluorescence. Migration, invasion,  and proliferation potentials were compared between the CAFs and NFs. A  co-culture of CAFs with HEp-2 cells and a co-injection of CAFs with HEp-2 cells in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted.

Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation.

In the case of  heart failure they are used for the treatment of swellings and shortness of  breath. The most frequently prescribed group of diuretics is thiazides and  similar products. In patients with renal insufficiency, loop diuretics are  administered. In the case of hypertension, diuretics are mainly used in the  combination treatment. The most frequently used diuretic in combination is again  hydrochlorothiazide, which is combined with reninangiotensin system blockers. It is mainly the combination of an ACE inhibitor + indapamide that seems to be  modern and promising, and it is, on the basis of large clinical trials,  recommended also for diabetics (ADVANCE) or for secondary prevention following a cerebrovascular accident (PROGRESS) or for the elderly (HYVET).

Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors.

Efficient dynamic-programming algorithms exist for solving this  problem; however, current solutions still require significant scan times. These  scan time requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid  growth in the size of these databases. This paper shows how reconfigurable  architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of  the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to  significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard  off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).

Describe OligoSTORM,"Oligopaint probes can be used for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation."," Context: analysis. Using this method, we can identify weakly stable regions in the TM  domain, which are found to be important structural determinants for beta-barrel  membrane proteins. By calculating the melting temperatures of the TM strands,  our method can also assess the stability of beta-barrel membrane proteins.  Predictions on membrane enzyme PagP are consistent with recent experimental NMR  and mutant studies. We have also discovered that out-clamps, in-plugs, and  oligomerization are 3 general mechanisms for stabilizing weakly stable TM  regions. In addition, we have found that extended and contiguous weakly stable  regions often signal the existence of an oligomer and that strands located in the interfaces of protein-protein interactions are considerably less stable.  Based on these observations, we can predict oligomerization states and can  identify the interfaces of protein-protein interactions for beta-barrel membrane proteins by using either structure or sequence information. In a set of 25  nonhomologous proteins with known structures, our method successfully predicted  whether a protein forms a monomer or an oligomer with 91% accuracy; in addition,  ,  Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: The use of medicinal plants concomitantly with conventional drugs can result in  herb-drug interactions that cause fluctuations in drug bioavailability and  consequent therapeutic failure and/or toxic effects. The CYP superfamily of  enzymes plays an important role in herb-drug interactions. Among CYP enzymes,  CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant since they metabolize about 50% and 30%  of the drugs on the market, respectively. Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of in vitro interactions between medicinal plant  extracts and drug substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Standardized extracts  from nine medicinal plants (Bauhinia forficata, Cecropia glaziovii, Cimicifuga racemosa, Cynara scolymus, Echinacea sp., Ginkgo biloba, Glycine max, Ilex  paraguariensis, and Matricaria recutita) were evaluated for their potential  interactions mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Among the extracts tested,  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the effect of pharmacogenetics on the  antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. BACKGROUND: Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by  polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP]  family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug  (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12). METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention  in the randomized PRINC (Plavix Response in Coronary Intervention) trial had  platelet function measured using the VerifyNow P2Y12 analyzer after a 600-mg or split 1,200-mg loading dose and after a 75- or 150-mg daily maintenance dosage.  Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the  CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of an organism, specifically in budding yeast."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome.

We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around a histone protein core to constitute the  fundamental repeating units of chromatin, the nucleosomes. The affinity of the  histone core for DNA depends on the nucleotide sequence; however, it is unclear  to what extent DNA sequence determines nucleosome positioning in vivo, and if  the same rules of sequence-directed positioning apply to genomes of varying  complexity. Using the data generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have identified positions of nucleosomes  containing the H2A.Z histone variant and histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 in  human CD4(+) T-cells. We find that the 10-bp periodicity observed in nucleosomal sequences in yeast and other organisms is not pronounced in human nucleosomal  sequences.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome in humans.," Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7  ,  Context: with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs,  monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B  cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven  functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent  autoimmune syndromes.  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage  with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum. Specifically, congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome type II have been linked to disruptions in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, leading to"," Context:  BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well  described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated  with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare. METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in  ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic  testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed. RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: of translation initiation (M1V), in isoform 3 (only in the cytosol) the  replacement occurs at Met91 (M91V) and is predicted benign. Another heterozygous  transition (c.-248G/A; -predicted to affect translation efficiency-) in the  5'-untranslated region of EDN3 (EDNRB ligand) was detected in all affected  individuals but not in healthy carriers of the EDNRB mutation. Also, a de novo  CNVs encompassing DACH1 was identified in the patient with heterochromia iridum  and HSCR Since the EDNRB and EDN3 variants only coexist in affected individuals,  HSCR could be due to the joint effect of mutations in genes of the same pathway.  Iris heterochromia could be due to an independent genetic event and would account for the additional phenotype within the family.  ,  Context:  The purpose of this study is to report a new and promising method for changing  iris color in a sectorial heterochromia iridis patient. A 22-year-old man with a  complaint of innate color disparity between his eyes presented to our clinic to seek medical advice. He underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination,  including visual acuity, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  measurements, endothelial cell count, and evaluation of iridocorneal angle. The causes of acquired heterochromia were excluded. After a detailed explanation of  the procedure and probable side effects, the patient underwent an application  with a laser device that produces a frequency-doubled 532 nm wavelength Nd:YAG  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone receptors TRα is most important in fat, but there is no explicit mention of thyronamines having an effect on fat tissue. However, it is mentioned that rodent studies suggest similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues ("," Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize how thyroid hormones exert their effects on  lipid metabolism through specific interaction with their nuclear receptors, to  review studies of the effects of new and selective thyromimetic drugs in animals and humans and to identify important questions for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid  hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRβ is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol  and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TRα is most important in fat, muscle, and  heart. Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics, tiromes) have been developed that  ,  Context:  The concept of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs that retain the beneficial effects  of TH excess on lipid lowering and fat metabolism, while avoiding any harmful  effects on the heart, muscle, bone and other tissues, has interested scientists and physicians for several decades. While there have been many attempts to  develop selective TH receptor (TR) modulators (STRMs) for safe lipid lowering,  these approaches have failed consistently. This review details recent advances in the development of TRβ subtype- and liver-selective STRM analogs, and  presents the results of preliminary clinical trials with one of these compounds,  eprotirome (KB-2115; Karo Bio AB).  ,  Context: Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to  those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature. Since  the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2)  release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial  ,  Context:  Thyronamines (TAMs) are a newly identified class of endogenous signaling  compounds. Their structure is identical to that of thyroid hormone and  deiodinated thyroid hormone derivatives, except that TAMs do not possess a carboxylate group. Despite some initial publications dating back to the 1950s,  TAMs did not develop into an independent area of research until 2004, when they  were rediscovered as potential ligands to a class of G protein-coupled receptors called trace-amine associated receptors. Since this discovery, two  representatives of TAMs, namely 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and thyronamine  (T(0)AM), have been detected in vivo.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines.

Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free  thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality  of life estimation. Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases.

Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody  ,  Context: in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter  modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: CONTEXT: The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is  incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed  the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally  been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed.  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease.

Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.  ,  Context: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.  ,  Context: recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of  postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed  successfully.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

By analyzing the distribution of  histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we  found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20  monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a  DCC-dependent manner. Depletion of H4K16ac also requires the conserved histone  deacetylase SIR-2.1, while enrichment of H4K20me1 requires the activities of the  histone methyltransferases SET-1 and SET-4.

Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Gene expression is mediated by specialized cis-regulatory modules  (CRMs), the most prominent of which are called enhancers. Early experiments  indicated that enhancers located far from the gene promoters are often  responsible for mediating gene transcription. Knowing their properties,  regulatory activity, and genomic targets is crucial to the functional  understanding of cellular events, ranging from cellular homeostasis to differentiation. Recent genome-wide investigation of epigenomic marks has  indicated that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain epigenomic marks,  such as, combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. METHODS: Our efforts in this paper are motivated by these recent advances in  epigenomic profiling methods, which have uncovered enhancer-associated chromatin  features in different cell types and organisms. Specifically, in this paper, we  ,  Context:  The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates  transcription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is  essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate  computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of  methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new  method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in Homo  sapiens and Mus musculus, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes  ,  Context: Long-range chromatin interactions play critical roles in genome organization and  regulation of transcription.

However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard  ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of  chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive  connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN  appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the  efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is  known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other  factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex  mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways  within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes.

Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: norfloxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, ciprofloxacin), 15 beta-lactam or  cephalosporin antibiotics (cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam,  cefdinir, cefoperazone, cefpiramide, cefamandole, cefixime, ceftibuten,  cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against UPEC strain UTI89.

CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of  Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira  guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus  callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are  presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of  microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our  knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.  ,  Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in  the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the  possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported.

This  article reviews causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The  incidence of antibiotic-associated colitis is increasing worldwide as a consequence of widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for various  illnesses. The pathogenic organism, Clostridium difficile, produces two  enterotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal inflammation. C. difficile infection presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from  asymptomatic carriers to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis.
