What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. Focal amplifications and homozygous deletions in genes targeting"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation.  PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the two-color multiplexing technique. RESULTS: We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were  associated with significantly decreased patient survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). Significant differences between gender were found,  with a higher expression level of the PCGF2 gene observed among females  (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.  ,  Context:  Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a major factor contributing  to pathogenesis of cancer including glioblastoma, the most common and most  malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Enzymatic modifications of histone proteins regulating gene expression are being exploited for therapeutic drug  targeting. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shown promising results  with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in various malignancies. This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of  HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in  glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as  ","19270706, 14688019, 20717685, 23179372, 23184418, 24838514","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"STAG1/STAG2 proteins maintain sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis and meiosis. In the developing nervous system, they are involved in several stages of meiosis, cooperating with a STAG3-specific complex to maintain sister chromatid cohesion"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context:  T-STAG (tissue-specific transcripts and genes) is a resource and web-interface,  designated to analyze tissue/tumor-specific expression patterns in human and  mouse transcriptomes. It integrates our refined prediction of specific expression patterns both in genes as well as in individual isoforms with  man-mouse orthology data. In combination with the features for  combining/contrasting the genes expressed in different tissues, T-STAG implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of  differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with  significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: pertaining chromatin structure and dynamics is available (i.e., human and  mouse). However, detailed chromatin knowledge is almost absent in most  organisms, specially protostome animals. Molluscs (which represent sentinel  organisms for the study of pollution) are not an exception to this lack of  knowledge. In the present work we first identified the existence of functionally  differentiated histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis (MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z), a marine organism widely used in  biomonitoring programs. Our results support the functional specialization of  these variants based on: a) their active expression in different tissues, as revealed by the isolation of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in gonad and  hepatopancreas; b) the evolutionary conservation of different residues  encompassing functional relevance; and c) their ability to confer specialization to nucleosomes, as revealed by nucleosome reconstitution experiments using  recombinant MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z histones. Given the seminal role of these  variants in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, their  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are  found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member,  STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,There is a case study of a 60-year-old woman who presented with intermittent utilization behavior (UB) of her mobile phone as the main clinical manifestation of partial complex status epilepticus due to a glioblastoma located in the right frontal region," Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: CI=0.9-1.6. The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for  astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1.8,95% CI=1.1-3.2,  digital phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.8, cordless phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.9.  Use of a telephone on the opposite side of the brain was not associated with a  significantly increased risk for brain tumours. Regarding anatomical area of the  tumour and exposure to microwaves, the risk was increased for tumours located in  the temporal area on the same side of the brain that was used during phone  calls, significantly so for analogue cellular telephones OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.2-4.1.  For acoustic neurinoma OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.1-9.2 was calculated among analogue cellular telephone users. When duration of use was analysed as a continuous  variable in the total material, the risk increased per year for analogue phones  with OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.08. For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend was for analogue phones OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.02-1.19, digital phones OR=1.11, 95%  CI=1.01-1.22, and cordless phones OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.19. There was a  tendency of a shorter tumour induction period for ipsilateral exposure to  ,  Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: electron-transport chain. It is interesting to notice that p53 antagonistically  regulates the inter-dependent glycolytic and OXPHOS cycles. It is important to  understand whether the p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of TIGAR and SCO2  is temporally segregated in cancer cells and what is the relation between these  paradoxical regulations of glycolytic pathway with the tumor suppressor activity  of p53. In this review we will elucidate the importance of p53-mediated  regulation of glycolysis and OXPHOS and its relation with the tumor suppressor  function of p53. Further since cellular metabolism shares great relation with  the process of aging we will also try and establish the role of p53 in regulation of aging via its transcriptional control of cellular metabolism.  ,  Context:  Utilization behavior (UB) consists of reaching out and using objects in the  environment in an automatic manner and out of context. This behavior has been  correlated to frontal lobe dysfunction, especially of the right hemisphere. We describe a 60-year-old woman, affected by a glioblastoma located in the right  frontal region, who presented with intermittent UB of the mobile phone as the  main clinical manifestation of partial complex status epilepticus. Video/EEG studies showed a striking correlation between mobile phone utilization and ictal  epileptic activity. Clinical and EEG findings were markedly reduced after the  introduction of antiepileptic drugs. This case study suggests that UB may be  ","23095687, 12527940, 24064953, 17851009, 22248668, 19126439","The association between cell phone use and incident glioblastoma remains unclear.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is applicable for characterizing diverse promoter architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide transcription start sites (TSSs), without relying on known promoter elements. It can be used to identify novel architectures"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone also at https://github.com/computationalBiology/NPLB/ (Mac OSX/Linux). CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context:  Currently DNA profiling methods only compare a suspect's DNA with DNA left at  the crime scene. When there is no suspect, it would be useful for the police to  be able to predict what the person of interest looks like by analysing the DNA left behind in a crime scene. Determination of the age of the suspect is an  important factor in creating an identikit. Human somatic cells gradually lose  telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual  from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged  between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR.  ,  Context: Microsatellites are genomic sequences comprised of tandem repeats of short  nucleotide motifs widely used as molecular markers in population genetics.  FullSSR is a new bioinformatic tool for microsatellite (SSR) loci detection and  primer design using genomic data from NGS assay. The software was tested with  2000 sequences of Oryza sativa shotgun sequencing project from the National  Center of Biotechnology Information Trace Archive and with partial genome  sequencing with ROCHE 454® from Caiman latirostris, Salvator merianae, Aegla  platensis, and Zilchiopsis collastinensis. FullSSR performance was compared  against other similar SSR search programs. The results of the use of this kind of approach depend on the parameters set by the user. In addition, results can  be affected by the analyzed sequences because of differences among the genomes.  FullSSR simplifies the detection of SSRs and primer design on a big data set. The command line interface of FullSSR was intended to be used as part of genomic  analysis tools pipeline; however, it can be used as a stand-alone program  because the results are easily interpreted for a nonexpert user.  ,  Context: analytical methods for future studies. For example, we estimated the effect of  number of mosquitoes dissected on variability of % inhibition, and simulated the  relationship between % inhibition in oocyst intensity and % inhibition of  prevalence of infected mosquitos at different mean oocysts in the control. SMFA  is one of the few biological assays used in preclinical and early clinical  development of transmission-blocking vaccines, and this study strongly supports  its further development and application.  ,  Context: produced by the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation characteristic of acute  promyelocytic leukemia. Yet, the physiological role of these nuclear bodies  remains unknown. Here, we show that SP100 binds to members of the  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) families of non-histone chromosomal proteins.  Further, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring splice variant of SP100, here  called SP100-HMG, is a member of the high mobility group-1 (HMG-1) protein  family and may thus possess DNA-binding potential. Both HP1 and SP100-HMG  concentrate in the PML/SP100 NBs, and overexpression of SP100 leads to enhanced  accumulation of endogenous HP1 in these structures. When bound to a promoter, SP100, SP100-HMG and HP1 behave as transcriptional repressors in transfected  mammalian cells. These observations present molecular evidence for an  association between the PML/SP100 NBs and the chromatin nuclear compartment. They support a model in which the NBs may play a role in certain aspects of  chromatin dynamics.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease (LBD) is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy that is characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies in the central and sympathetic nervous systems.," Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context: It is well known that autonomic failure is severer in patients with dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).  According to the Braak's hypothesis, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory  bulb or peripheral autonomic nervous system. Lewy bodies in the peripheral  autonomic nervous system ascend to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerve, while  those in the olfactory bulb expand to the limbic system. Lewy bodies later  attain the substantia nigra. However, it seems that Braak staging can not  explain difference in severity of autonomic failure between DLB and PD. As a  possibility, in DLB patients with significant autonomic failure, Lewy bodies may have been localized to the peripheral autonomic nervous system in a long time  before onset of dementia or parkinsonism, and propagation of Lewy bodies into  the central nervous system may be initiated by apparition of certain promotion factor, such as ageing and amyloid-β.  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ","14502650, 24597591, 1534893, 24465140, 24291999, 2085926",Parkinson s disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for screening Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It can also be used for screening Obstructive Sleep"," Context: Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of the NoSAS score in the screening  of patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS), and to  compare the performance of the NoSAS score with other tools including Epworth  Sleepiness Scale(ESS), STOP, STOP-Bang(SBQ) and Berlin questionnaires. Methods:  A total of 444 consecutive patients(328 males and 116 females) with suspected  OSAHS who underwent an overnight polysomnography(PSG) were recruited into this  study. Five questionnaires including the NoSAS score, ESS, STOP, SBQ and Berlin  were completed. Based on the severity of OSAHS which was determined by  apnea-hypopnea index(AHI), the patients were classified into 4 groups: normal(<5 events/h), mild(5-15 events/h), moderate(15-30 events/h) and, severe (≥30  events/h) OSA.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative  predictive values and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 5 questionnaires were calculated. Results: With AHI≥5 events/h as the  standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the NoSAS score and SBQ questionnaire showed a  moderate performance, with the NoSAS score having the largest area under the ROC  ,  Context: Objective:To evaluate the value of improved Mallampati grading combined with  NoSAS questionnaire in screening for obstructive sleep apnea （OSA）. Method:A  total of 344 patients admitted to our hospital for sleep disorders were studied.  All patients were measured for their height, weight, neck circumference and  other parameters. NoSAS scores, improved Mallampati grading and polysomnography  （PSG） were performed in these patients. According to AHI in PSG monitoring results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of ≥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening.  A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.  ,  Context: developed and validated in population-based studies. AIM: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score for the screening of SDB  patients from a sleep clinic in China, and to compare the predictive value of  the NoSAS score with the STOP-Bang questionnaire. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients from a sleep clinic who had undergone  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) testing by type III portable monitor device at the  hospital and completed the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score was assessed  by reviewing medical records. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive  value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different  AHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening. RESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were diagnosed with SDB. When predicting overall (AHI ≥ 5), moderate-to-severe  (AHI ≥ 15), and severe (AHI ≥ 30) SDB, the sensitivity and specificity of the  NoSAS score were 71.2, 80.4, and 83.1% and 62.4, 49.3, and 40.7%, respectively.  ,  Context: compare its performance with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), STOP-Bang, and  Berlin questionnaires for high-risk SDB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Patients who had a  full-night PSG examination between 01.03.2017 and 01.01.2018 at the sleep center  of our hospital were included in the study. Demographic characteristics,  anthropometrics measurements, ESS, STOP-Bang, and Berlin scores were collected  from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB. RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4% for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Pufferfish, specifically the genus Takifugu, is associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX)."," Context:  Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins, tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly.

We aimed to  identify intrinsic traits that predict which Ixodes tick species are confirmed  or strongly suspected to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens.  METHODS: We focused on the well-studied tick genus Ixodes from which many  species are known to transmit zoonotic diseases to humans. We apply generalized  boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240 species of Ixodes ticks to learn what intrinsic features distinguish zoonotic vectors from  non-vector species. In addition to better understanding the biological  underpinnings of tick vectorial capacity, the model generates a per species probability of being a zoonotic vector on the basis of intrinsic biological  similarity with known Ixodes vector species.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ,  Context: particularly on the X chromosome. However, the relative importance of population  bottlenecks and selective sweeps in explaining this reduction is uncertain. We  surveyed variation at 31 microsatellites across a 330-kb section of the X  chromosome located between the white and kirre genes. Two linked clusters of  loci were observed with reduced variation and a skew toward rare alleles in both  an Ecuador and a Zimbabwe population sample. Examining Zimbabwe DNA sequence  polymorphism within one of these regions allowed us to localize a selective  sweep to a 361-bp window within the 5' regulatory region of the roughest gene,  with one nucleotide substitution representing the best candidate for the target of selection. Estimates of sweep age suggested that this fixation event occurred  prior to the expansion of D. melanogaster from sub-Saharan Africa. For both  putative sweep regions in our data set, cosmopolitan populations showed wider footprints of selection compared to those in Zimbabwe. This pattern appears  consistent with the demographic amplification of preexisting sweep signals due  to one or more population bottlenecks.  ,  Context:  Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such  as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply  of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used  ","22491190, 21076829, 25838885, 28405579, 16322515, 24075201","Selective sweep is a phenomenon in which the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles within a population reduces genetic diversity at partially linked neutral loci.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include Atg5, Atg7, Atg10, Atg12, Beclin-1, LC3, and ULK1 protein kinase. Additionally, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosph"," Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests  that impairment of lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in  alpha-synuclein clearance might play an important role. For this reason, we  sought to examine the expression levels of members of the autophagy pathway in brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in alpha-synuclein  transgenic mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By immunoblot analysis, compared to controls and AD, in DLB cases levels of mTor were elevated and Atg7 were reduced. Levels of  other components of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5, Atg10, Atg12 and  Beclin-1 were not different in DLB compared to controls. In DLB brains, mTor was  ,  Context: identified the ubiquitin-binding deacetylase, HDAC6, as a key component that  establishes QC. HDAC6 is not required for autophagy activation per se; rather,  it is recruited to ubiquitinated autophagic substrates where it stimulates  autophagosome-lysosome fusion by promoting F-actin remodeling in a  cortactin-dependent manner. Remarkably, HDAC6 and cortactin are dispensable for  starvation-induced autophagy. These findings reveal that autophagosomes  associated with QC are molecularly and biochemically distinct from those  associated with starvation autophagy, thereby providing a new molecular  framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and therapeutic potential of this unique machinery.  ,  Context: Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a dynamic process for degradation of cytosolic  components. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions,  and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system  responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence  factors for blocking autophagy, whereas others utilize some autophagy components  for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  ,  Context: Macroautophagy/autophagy is an intracellular recycling system that delivers  cytoplasmic organelles and materials to lysosomes for degradation. This process  is operated by autophagy-related (ATG) genes and tightly controlled by  stress-responsive signaling pathways. Our recent study revealed that autophagy  programs are transcriptionally suppressed by the BET family protein BRD4. This  repression is alleviated during nutrient deprivation through the AMPK-SIRT1  pathway. Our findings therefore provide new insights into the regulation of  autophagy.  ,  Context: Autophagic programmed cell death occurs during the development of diverse animal  groups, but the mechanisms that control this genetically regulated form of cell  killing are poorly understood. Genetic studies of bulk protein degradation in  yeast have provided important advances in our understanding of autophagy, and  recent investigations of Drosophila autophagic cell death suggest that some of  these mechanisms may be conserved. In Drosophila, several steroid-regulated  genes that encode transcription regulators are required for autophagic cell  death. These transcription regulators appear to activate a large number of genes  that play a more direct role in cell killing, including genes that function in apoptosis such as caspases. While caspase function is required for autophagic  cell death during Drosophila development, genes encoding proteins that are  similar to the yeast autophagy regulators are also induced in dying salivary glands. Furthermore, numerous noncaspase proteases, cytoplasmic organizing  factors, signaling molecules, and unknown factors are expressed in interesting  patterns during autophagic cell death.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation."," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost  always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to  produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding  genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic  repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional  ,  Context: the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  enrichment of genes associated with particular biological processes. Secondly,  disease associated SNPs were mapped on circRNA loci, and Argonaute (Ago)  interaction sites on circular RNAs were identified. We compiled a database of  disease-circRNA association in Circ2Traits (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/),  the first comprehensive knowledgebase of potential association of circular RNAs  with diseases in human.  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CircPro is available at  http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro. CONTACT: mchen@zju.edu.cn. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in the initiation  and progression of many tumors. Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs  (circRNAs) have been described in eukaryotic cells:;they comprise a new class of  gene regulators. Naturally occurring circular miR sponges, which induce miR  loss-of-function, can prevent endogenous onco-miRs from binding to their cognate  mRNA targets. These findings suggest that synthetic (artificial) circular RNAs could be constructed as therapeutic molecular sponges to suppress harmful  onco-miRs. Using enzymatic ligation, we designed and constructed a circular RNA  containing both miR-21 and miR-93 binding sites. The synthetic circular sponge was resistant to digestion with RNase R. Luciferase assays and functional  experiments showed that the circular multi-miR sponge was more stable than its  linear counterpart. Moreover, endogenous miR-21 and miR-93 were inhibited by the  ","32059672, 26442181, 24339831, 33650643, 29028266, 31217510","Circ-ZNF609 is associated with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.

"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?","No, there are drugs available for PrEP, such as tenofovir/emtricitabine, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration."," Context: BACKGROUND: The potential impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with overlapping and nonoverlapping  antiretrovirals (ARVs) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and  drug resistance is unknown.  METHODS: A detailed mathematical model was used to simulate the epidemiological  impact of ART alone, PrEP alone, and combined ART + PrEP in South Africa. RESULTS: ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count <200 cells/µL (80%  coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but  increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75%  effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance prevalence of 0.5%. The ratio of cumulative infections prevented to prevalent  drug-resistant cases after 10 years is 7-fold higher for PrEP than for ART.  Combined ART + PrEP with overlapping ARVs prevents 35% of infections but increases resistance prevalence to 8.2%, whereas ART + PrEP with nonoverlapping  ARVs prevents slightly more infections (37%) and reduces resistance prevalence  to 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Combined ART + PrEP is likely to prevent more HIV infections than  ,  Context: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental approach to HIV prevention  and consists of antiretroviral drugs to be taken before potential HIV exposure  in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection and continued during periods of  risk. An effective PrEP could provide an additional safety net to sexually  active persons at risk, when combined with other prevention strategies. Women  represent nearly 60% of adults infected with HIV and PrEP can be a  female-controlled prevention method for women who are unable to negotiate condom  use. Two antiretroviral nucleoside analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor  drugs are currently under trial as PrEP drugs, namely tenofovirdisoproxilfumarate (TDF) alone and TDF in combination with emricitabine  (FTC), to be taken as daily single dose oral drugs. There are 11 ongoing trials  of ARV-based prevention in different at risk populations across the world. The iPrex trial showed that daily use of oral TDF/FTC by MSM resulted in 44%  reduction in the incidence of HIV. This led to publication of interim guidance  by CDC to use of PrEP by health providers for MSM. Few other trials are Bangkok  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To outline ibalizumab (Patent: US20120121597A1) and fostemsavir  (Patent: US8871771) future applications in people living with multi-drug  resistant HIV with few remaining treatment options.  METHODS: We analysed the available literature and data from ongoing clinical  trials about ibalizumab and fostemsavir. RESULTS: Ibalizumab is a new humanized monoclonal antibody. It acts as  post-attachment inhibitor by binding CD4 2nd domain of T lymphocyte and  preventing HIV connection to CCR5 or CXCR4 and has been recently approved by  Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America as a new intravenous antiretroviral agent for heavily treated HIV adults with multi -drug  resistant infection. Fostemsavir (formerly BMS-663068), the oral prodrug of  temsavir, is another attachment inhibitor. It acts by preventing the viral connection to CD4 by binding gp120. This drug showed encouraging results in  heavily treated patients as add-on agent to current antiretroviral regimens, in  particular for subtype B virus. It is currently being investigated in a phase 3,  ,  Context: regimen of CAB and rilpivirine have demonstrated promising virological activity  in oral as well as in parenteral therapy, which are currently investigated in  phase three trials. Moreover, CAB protected macaques from experimental  simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection and showed promising tolerability  in the first trial in humans for preexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection. CAB  might, therefore, provide the basis of the new treatment paradigm of parenteral  treatment and prevention of HIV infection.  ,  Context: Drug-drug interactions are a major practical concern for physicians treating  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of the many medications that  HIV-positive patients must take. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions can occur at  different levels (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and are  difficult to predict. Of all the processes that give rise to drug interactions,  metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) is the most frequent. Moreover,  medications prescribed to HIV-positive patients may also be CYP3A inhibitors and  inducers: Tipranavir, in the absence of ritonavir, is a CYP3A inducer, and  ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor. Fortunately, the drug interactions between tipranavir coadministered with ritonavir and other antiretroviral medications or  with other medications commonly used in HIV therapy are well characterized. This  review summarizes the pharmacokinetic interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir and 11 other antiretroviral medications and between tipranavir/ritonavir and  drugs used to treat opportunistic infections such as fungal infections,  antiretroviral-treatment-related conditions such as hyperlipidemia, and side  effects such as diarrhea.  ,  Context:  Despite significant efforts, the rate of new HIV infections worldwide remains  unacceptably high, highlighting the need for new HIV prevention strategies.

The use of daily tenofovir/emtricitabine as oral PrEP was found  to be effective in multiple placebo-controlled clinical trials and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Phases I and II of the HapMap project generated genotype data across ∼3 million  SNP loci in 270 individuals representing four populations. Phase III provides  dense genotype data on ∼1.5 million SNPs, generated by Illumina and Affymetrix  platforms in a larger set of individuals. Release 3 of phase III of the HapMap contains 1397 individuals from 11 populations, including 250 of the original 270  phase I and phase II individuals and 1147 additional individuals.

Here we identify HAX-1 as a  regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity  in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium  kinetics and mechanics. Conversely, downregulation of HAX-1 enhanced calcium cycling and contractility. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon  phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling  basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the  ,  Context: The goal of the Human Proteome Project (HPP) is to fully characterize the 21,000  human protein-coding genes with respect to the estimated two million proteins  they encode. As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource  to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment. Similarly  to the Human Genome Project (HGP), the HPP chose a chromosome-centric approach,  assigning different chromosomes to different countries. Here we introduce a scoring method for chromosome ranking based on several characteristics,  including relevance to health problems, existing published knowledge, and  current transcriptome and proteome coverage. The score of each chromosome was computed as a weighted combination of indexes reflecting the aforementioned  characteristics. The approach is tailored to the chromosome-centric HPP (C-HPP),  and is advantageous in that it takes into account currently available  ,  Context: hCMG complex), coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with  viruses expressing the hCMG complex and hCtf4, and from HeLa cell chromatin  after benzonase and immunoprecipitation steps. The stability of the hCtf4-CMG  complex depends upon interactions between hCtf4 and multiple components of the  hCMG complex. The hCtf4-CMG complex, like the hCMG complex, contains DNA  helicase activity that is more salt-resistant than the helicase activity of the  hCMG complex. We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric  hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts  as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex. The role of the hCMG complex as the core of the replisome is also discussed.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context: high-risk HPVs encode two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which are essential for cellular  transformation in HPV-positive cells. The ability of high-risk HPV E6 and E7  protein to promote the degradation of p53 and pRb, respectively, has been  suggested as a mechanism by which HPV oncogenes induce cellular transformation.  E6 and E7 abrogate cell cycle checkpoints and induce genomic instability that  leads to malignant conversion.Although the prophylactic HPV vaccine has recently  become available, it will not be effective for immunosuppressed individuals or  those who are already infected. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for  HPV-associated cancers is still clinically relevant. Studies on genomic instability will shed light on mechanisms by which HPV induces cancer and hold  promise for the identification of targets for drug development.  ,  Context:  FANCJ mutations are associated with breast cancer and genetically linked to the  bone marrow disease Fanconi anemia (FA). The genomic instability of FA-J mutant  cells suggests that FANCJ helicase functions in the replicational stress response. A putative helicase with sequence similarity to FANCJ in  Caenorhabditis elegans (DOG-1) and mouse (RTEL) is required for poly(G) tract  maintenance, suggesting its involvement in the resolution of alternate DNA structures that impede replication. Under physiological conditions, guanine-rich  sequences spontaneously assemble into four-stranded structures (G quadruplexes  [G4]) that influence genomic stability. FANCJ unwound G4 DNA substrates in an  ,  Context: rates of RNA viruses are much larger (Holland et al. 1982) and can approach the  maximum tolerable deleterious mutation rate of one per genome (Eigen and  Schuster 1977; Eigen 1993). Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display  spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have  mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This  constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not  necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. Furthermore, there  need not be a constant rate for somatic mutations during development. In this  review, we consider mutations in cancer, a pathology in which there appears to be an increase in the rate of somatic mutations throughout the genome. Moreover,  within the eukaryotic genome, as in microbes, there are ""hot-spots"" that exhibit  unusually high mutation frequencies. It seems conceivable to us that many tumors contain thousands of changes in DNA sequence. The major question is: how do  these mutations arise, and how many are rate-limiting for tumor progression?  ,  Context: SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of  Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent  annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage.

In this review, we summarize the main roles of SMARCAL1 in  DNA repair, telomere maintenance and replication fork stability in response to  DNA replication stress.  ,  Context: Centrosome amplification plays a key role in the origin of chromosomal  instability (CIN) during cancer development and progression.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.  ,  Context: site. After induction, the association of these proteins with the  promoter-proximal region continues whereas RNAPII and DSIF are also found in the  downstream regions. Depletion of a subunit of NELF by RNA interference enhances  the junB mRNA level both before and after induction, indicating that DSIF- and  NELF-mediated pausing contributes to the negative regulation of junB expression,  not only by inducing RNAPII pausing before induction but also by attenuating  transcription after induction. These regulatory mechanisms appear to be  conserved in other immediate-early genes as well.  ,  Context:  Transcription of eukaryotic genes by RNA polymerase II (pol II) is a complex,  highly regulated multiphasic process. Pol II pauses in the proximity of the  promoter on a large fraction of transcribed genes. Transcription initiation and elongation of transcripts are under distinct control. Induced gene expression  can thus be due to enhanced initiation and/or stimulated elongation. Pausing and  resumption of the elongation of transcripts is under the control of transcription elongation factors. Three of them, P-TEFb, DSIF, and NELF have  been well characterized as protein complexes with multiple general but also gene  specific functions. Elongation factors execute checkpoint functions but serve  ,  Context: polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation by acting as a decoy for the  negative elongation factor (NELF) complex upon induction of immediate early  genes (IEGs) in neurons. eRNAs are synthesized prior to the culmination of  target gene transcription and interact with the NELF complex. Knockdown of eRNAs  expressed at neuronal enhancers impairs transient release of NELF from the  specific target promoters during transcriptional activation, coinciding with a  decrease in target mRNA induction. The enhancer-promoter interaction was  unaffected by eRNA knockdown. Instead, chromatin looping might enable eRNAs to  act locally at a specific promoter.

This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor.

On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context: A 46-year-old man with factor VIII deficiency presented with a rare case of  hemophilic pseudotumor in the temporal bone manifesting as severe conductive  hearing loss and external ear bleeding. The pseudotumor expanded and destroyed  the temporal bone and skin of the external ear over the course of 8 years. The  pseudotumor was surgically excised, and the patient's symptoms improved.  Histological examination of a specimen collected from inside the pseudotumor  demonstrated blood products in various stages of evolution and showed that the  outer membrane consisted of a collagen layer. Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare  complications occurring in 1-2% of patients with mild or severe hemophilia. Pseudotumors are chronic, slowly expanding, encapsulated cystic masses, and most  are located in the long bones and pelvis.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

Its presentation is characteristic in females about 40  years of age. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features and is  confirmed by electrical criteria.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is regulated by mTORC1. mTORC1 drives HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of STAT3."," Context: acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK  phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the  insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor  substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling  was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance. We conclude that the  upregulation of Notch1 expression by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is an  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in  embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively  differentiate into primitive endoderm. Although Nanog repression occurs at the  outermost layer of ES cell aggregates independent of the leukemia inhibitory  factor (LIF)/STAT3 pathway, it is largely undetermined what external cues and  intracellular signals cause the event. Of interest, addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, selectively repressed Nanog  transcription without any detectable changes in upstream transcriptional  regulators Oct3/4 and Sox2. Furthermore, sodium vanadate induced primitive endoderm differentiation, even in the inner cells of ES cell aggregates.  Expression of Gata6 and Zfp42, two putative downstream Nanog effectors, was also  increased and decreased by the addition of sodium vanadate, respectively, but  ,  Context: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent  cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of  signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine  phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear  translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal  physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many  cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates  cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis. In this paper, we first describe the mechanism of STAT3  regulation followed by how STAT3 is involved in cancer metastasis, then we  summarize the various small molecule inhibitors that inhibit STAT3 signaling.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence."," Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in  patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA  shunting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive  register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE  (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also  searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify  potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other  databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August  2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV  treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other  significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The  eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA  shunts.  ,  Context: intrafamilial clinical phenotype variability. Two patients had PSP-like  phenotypes with dystonia, vertical gaze slowness, dysexecutive syndrome,  predominant axial rigidity, and midbrain atrophy on brain magnetic resonance  imaging. The other patients manifested Perry syndrome, isolated parkinsonism, or  a predominant behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations of the DCTN1 gene have been previously  associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with Perry syndrome, a rare  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by weight loss, parkinsonism, central  hypoventilation, and psychiatric disturbances. Our study demonstrates that DCTN1 mutations should be searched for in patients with clinical PSP-like phenotypes  and a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, especially when a familial  history of dementia, psychiatric disturbances, associated parkinsonism, or an autosomal dominant disorder is present.  ,  Context: sweating and flushing in patients with apparently abnormal ocular sympathetic  innervation has been defined as harlequin sign. To date, a few reports of  excessive hemifacial sweating and flushing in structural lesion have been  documented. Herein, we report five patients with excessive hemifacial sweating  and flushing, two of whom had a syrinx. In presenting the patients, we have  attempted to distinguish harlequin syndrome from harlequin sign. With this in  mind, Case 1 can be described as harlequin syndrome resembling Ross syndrome,  Case 2 as harlequin syndrome with normal ocular sympathetic innervation, Case 3  as harlequin sign with congenital Horner syndrome, Case 4 as harlequin sign with sympathetic and parasympathetic denervation sensitivity, and Case 5 as harlequin  syndrome associated with occult sympathetic denervation sensitivity. These cases  are discussed together with a review of the literature.  ,  Context: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal bossing,  large eyebrows, medially flaring and sparse in the middle part, hypertelorism,  deep set but large eyes, large and uplifted ear lobes, with a central  depression, saddle nose with prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella,  open mouth, with M-shaped upper lip, frequent smiling, and a prominent but  narrow and triangular pointed chin), moderate-to-severe intellectual deficiency,  epilepsy and variable congenital malformations including Hirschsprung disease  (HSCR), genitourinary anomalies (in particular hypospadias in males), congenital heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and eye anomalies. The prevalence  of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It  seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger  E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1).

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental  ,  Context: to the identification of putative clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of this  gene family. By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.  ,  Context: proteins that may form high-molecular-weight (HMW) aggregates in the matrix of  fish otoliths that have aragonite and vaterite as their crystal polymorphs. By  screening a cDNA library of the trout inner ear using an antiserum raised  against whole otolith matrix, a novel protein, named otolith matrix  macromolecule-64 (OMM-64), was identified. The protein was found to have a  molecular mass of 64 kDa, and to contain two tandem repeats and a Glu-rich  region. The structure of the protein and that of its DNA are similar to those of  starmaker, a protein involved in the polymorphism control in the zebrafish  otoliths [Söllner C, Burghammer M, Busch-Nentwich E, Berger J, Schwarz H, Riekel C & Nicolson T (2003) Science302, 282-286]. (45)Ca overlay analysis revealed  that the Glu-rich region has calcium-binding activity. Combined analysis by  western blotting and deglycosylation suggested that OMM-64 is present in an HMW aggregate with heparan sulfate chains.

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,"PMP22 and LITAF are two genes that have been found to be mutated in CMT1A. The T118M mutation in PMP22 is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A (CMT1A),"," Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context: contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22. Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic  phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare  cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy. Our findings show that the CMT1A phenotype of reduced NCV is specifically associated with PMP22 gene duplications, thus providing further  support for the PMP22 gene dosage mechanism for CMT1A.  ,  Context:  The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked  ,  Context: duplication in chromosome 17p12 that includes PMP22. This study reports a woman  with a family history of CMT1A due to PMP22 duplication. However, she presented  with a more severe phenotype than her sibling or ancestors and was found to have  a PMP22 triplication instead of the duplication. This was caused by de novo  mutation on her affected mother's duplication chromosome. Her lower limb  magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe diffused atrophy and fatty  replacement. However, her affected sister with typical PMP22 duplication showed  almost intact lower limb. Triplication patient's median motor nerve conduction  velocity was far lower compared with her sister. Her onset age was faster (8 years) than her sister (42 years). CMT1A triplication might be generated by a  female-specific chromosomal rearrangement mechanism that is different from the  frequent paternal-originated CMT1A duplication. It also suggests that the wide phenotypic variation of CMT1A might be partly caused by unstable genomic  rearrangement, including PMP22 triplication.  ,  Context:  Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth  neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal  dominant centronuclear myopathy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type  B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated  with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular  atrophy (dSMA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized almost  exclusively by degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal  part of the limbs. One subtype, dHMN type V (dHMN-V), is transmitted by  autosomal dominant inheritance and predominantly involves the hands.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,Avapritinib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop mutants.," Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: of avapritinib and provide evidence-based guidance on management of  avapritinib-associated adverse events (AEs), including cognitive effects and  intracranial bleeding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a two-part,  single-arm dose escalation/expansion phase I study (NAVIGATOR; NCT02508532) in  patients with U/M GISTs treated with oral avapritinib 30-600 mg once daily. The  primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; the impact of dose modification  (interruption and/or reduction) on progression-free survival (PFS) was a  secondary endpoint. Efficacy analyses were limited to patients who started  avapritinib at 300 mg (approved dose). RESULTS: Of 250 patients enrolled in the study, 74.0% presented with KIT  mutation and 24.8% presented with PDGFRA exon 18-mutation; 66.8% started  avapritinib at 300 mg. The most common treatment-related AEs (any grade) were nausea (59.2%), fatigue (50.0%), periorbital edema (42.0%), anemia (39.2%),  diarrhea (36.0%), vomiting (36.0%), and increased lacrimation (30.8%). No  treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 167 patients starting on 300 mg  ,  Context: (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 ), or exon 9 (UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ) mutations, respectively. We  compared avapritinib (10 and 30 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle, imatinib (50  mg/kg/bid) or regorafenib (30 mg/kg/once daily; UZLX-GIST9 KIT11+17 );  avapritinib (10, 30, 100 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle or imatinib  [UZLX-GIST3 KIT11 ]; and avapritinib (10, 30, 60 mg/kg/once daily) versus  vehicle, imatinib (50, 100 mg/kg/twice daily), or sunitinib (40 mg/kg/once  daily; UZLX-GIST2B KIT9 ).  RESULTS: In all models, avapritinib resulted in reduction of tumor volume,  significant inhibition of proliferation, and reduced KIT signaling. In two  models, avapritinib led to remarkable histologic responses, increase in apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation. Avapritinib showed superior  (UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 and -GIST2B KIT 9 ) or equal (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 )  antitumor activity to the standard dose of imatinib. In UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 , the antitumor effects of avapritinib were significantly better than with  imatinib or regorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Avapritinib has significant antitumor activity in GIST PDX models  ,  Context: Avapritinib (AYVAKIT™) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of  platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop  mutants. It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNA (circRNA) acts as a microRNA sponge, regulator of alternative splicing, transcription factor, and plays an important role in regulating gene expression. It also serves as a miRNA sponge to involve in the expression regulation of various genes and"," Context: several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has  led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  the pre‑metastatic niche. Additionally, studies have revealed the mechanism by  which exosomal circRNA affects malignant progression through signal  transduction. Moreover, exosomal circRNA promotes tumor metastasis by regulating gene expression, RNA transcription and protein translation. In this review, the  biological features and clinical application of exosomal circRNA are described,  highlighting the underlying mechanisms through which they regulate tumor metastasis. The application of circRNA as clinical diagnostic biomarkers and in  the development of novel therapeutic strategies is also discussed.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that,  unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene  regulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in  splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an  increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs  are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns.  Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have  been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization.  Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential  functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to  RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the  transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and  that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation  ,  Context: Thousands of loci in the human and mouse genomes give rise to circular RNA  transcripts; at many of these loci, the predominant RNA isoform is a circle.  Using an improved computational approach for circular RNA identification, we  found widespread circular RNA expression in Drosophila melanogaster and estimate  that in humans, circular RNA may account for 1% as many molecules as poly(A)  RNA. Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for  each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each  gene were cell-type specific. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression  program.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a large class of covalently closed circRNA. As a  member of competitive endogenous RNA, it participates in the regulation of  circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and plays an important role in the regulation of  physiology and pathology. CircRNA is produced by the reverse splicing of exon,  intron or both, forming exon or intron circRNA. Studies have shown that circRNA  is a ubiquitous molecule, which exceeds the linear mRNA distributed in human  cells. Because of its covalent closed-loop structure, circRNA is resistant to  RNase R, which is more stable than linear mRNA; circRNA is highly conserved in  different species. It was found that circRNA competitively adsorbs miRNA, as a miRNA sponge, to involve in the expression regulation of a variety of genes and  plays an important role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis and other  processes. These molecules offer new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention and serve as biomarkers for diagnosis. In this paper, the origin,  characteristics and functions of circRNA and its role in tumor development,  invasion and metastasis, diagnosis and prognosis are reviewed.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray free electron lasers are used at facilities such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, and the Xray Free Electron LASER (XFEL) at Hamburg, Germany"," Context:  Matter with a high energy density (>10(5) joules per cm(3)) is prevalent  throughout the Universe, being present in all types of stars and towards the  centre of the giant planets; it is also relevant for inertial confinement fusion. Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure,  requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous  temperatures and densities. With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been  ,  Context: industrial property milestone-documents and their overall numeral trends are  presented. In 1971, J. Madey invented and developed the Free Electron LASER  (FEL), a vacuum-tube that uses a beam of relativistic electrons passing through  a periodic, transverse magnetic field (wiggler) to produce coherent radiation,  contained in an optical cavity defined by mirrors. A resonance condition that  involves the energy of the electron beam, the strength of the magnetic field,  and the periodicity of the magnet determines the wavelength of the radiation.  The FEL Coherent Light Sources like the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at  Stanford, CA, USA or the Xray Free Electron LASER (XFEL) at Hamburg, Germany, will work much like a high-speed (< 100 femtoseconds) camera, enabling  scientists to take stop-motion pictures, on the nanoscale, of atoms and  molecules in motion. The curve of FEL-related patents of the last 20 years is much smoother than the corresponding one for in vitro Diagnostics conventional  LASERS. If the diodes brought a LASER into almost everyone's pocket, the  above-mentioned super-imaging systems are huge facilities of enormous cost--the  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context:  The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  ,  Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac  Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the  United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination. With X-ray  pulse durations down to 10 fs or shorter, and up to 10(13) transversely coherent  photons per pulse in a narrow spectral bandwidth, focused irradiances of 10(18)  to 10(21) W cm(-2) or higher can be produced at X-ray energies ranging from 500 eV to 10 keV.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain, involving forebrain and facial malformations that can range from mild to severe."," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8.

However, in-spite of the similarities between neurological disorders caused by perinatal hypothyroidism and those caused by  various genetic mitochondrial defects we still do not know as to how thyroid  hormone (TH) regulates mitochondrial transcription during development and whether this regulation by TH is nuclear mediated or through mitochondrial TH  receptors? We here in rat cerebellum show that hypothyroidism causes reduction  in expression of nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis like  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly is addressed under the following headings: alobar, semilobar,  and lobar holoprosencephaly; arrhinencephaly; agenesis of the corpus callosum;  pituitary abnormalities; hindbrain abnormalities; syntelencephaly;  aprosencephaly/atelencephaly; neural tube defects; facial anomalies; median  cleft lip; minor facial anomalies; single maxillary central incisor;  holoprosencephaly-like phenotype; epidemiology; genetic causes of holoprosencephaly; teratogenic causes of holoprosencephaly; SHH mutations; ZIC2  mutations; SIX3 mutations; TGIF mutations; PTCH mutations; GLI2 mutations; FAST1  mutations; TDGF1 mutations; and DHCR7 mutations.  ,  Context: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic condition where variable and  multiple congenital anomalies including Hirschsprung's disease, intellectual  disability, and prominent facial features are present. At molecular level, MWS  is characterized by many different described mutations in the zinc finger E-box  protein 2 (ZEB2) gene, ultimately leading to loss of gene function. This report  is the first to describe the association of MWS with two different asynchronous  malignant brain tumors (medulloblastoma and glioblastoma) occurring in a child.  ,  Context:  Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the  embryonic forebrain. It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can  range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case  series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in  case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted population-based studies.

He had had hypertension for  17 years, chronic renal failure for 4 years and gouty arthritis for 3 years.  Panendoscopy was done and showed diffusely scattered small black and brown  pigmentation over the stomach and duodenum. Tissue biopsies from the black  pigmented lesions were taken for further microscopic and histochemical  evaluation. Histological finding and special histochemical stains, Fontana  stain, revealed mild chronic inflammation with accumulation of hemosiderin pigment in the lamina propria of the stomach and duodenal villi. This condition  is called Pseudomelanosis duodeni. The literature of this condition was also  reviewed.  ,  Context: Pseudomelanosis duodeni (PD) is a rare dark speckled appearance of the duodenum  associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, chronic heart failure,  chronic renal failure and consumption of different drugs. We report four cases  of PD associated with chronic renal failure admitted to the gastroenterology  outpatient unit due to epigastric pain, nausea, melena and progressive reduction  of hemoglobin index. Gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed erosions in the esophagus  and stomach, with no active bleeding at the moment. In addition, the duodenal  mucosa presented marked signs of melanosis; later confirmed by histopathological  study. Even though PD is usually regarded as a benign condition, its pathogenesis and clinical significance is yet to be defined.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare incidental finding seen on endoscopy and has  the characteristic appearance of flat, black-speckled pigmented mucosa.

The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: The profound effects of thyroid hormone (TH) on heart development and function  are mediated by the thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha(1) and beta(1). While  numerous patients with TRbeta(1) mutations have been identified, patients with  similar mutations in TRalpha(1) are yet to be discovered. Recently generated  heterozygous mice with a dominant negative mutation in TRalpha(1) (TRalpha(1)+/m  mice) have normal TH levels, which may have hampered the discovery of patients  with such mutations. We now measure intracellular Ca(2+) and contraction in  cardiomyocytes isolated from TRalpha(1)+/m mice and wildtype littermates (WT).  TRalpha(1)+/m cardiomyocytes showed a phenotype similar to that in hypothyroidism with significant slowing of voltage-activated Ca(2+) transients  and contractions. Increased stimulation frequency (from 0.5 to 3 Hz) or  beta-adrenergic stimulation reduced the differences between TRalpha(1)+/m and WT cardiomyocytes. However, in TRalpha(1)+/m cells stimulation at 3 Hz gave a  marked increase in diastolic Ca(2+) and beta-adrenergic stimulation triggered  spontaneous Ca(2+) release events during relaxation.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition  is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that  share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established at the Public Health Agency of Canada with COVID-19 literature was searched for  articles referencing MIS-C, PIMS or Kawasaki Disease in relation to COVID-19. RESULTS: : A total of 195 out of 988 articles were included in the review. The median age of MIS-C patients was between seven and 10 years of age, although  children of all ages (and adults) can be affected. Multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children disproportionately affected males (58% patients), and Black  ,  Context: Several studies demonstrated that COVID-19 in children is a relatively mild  disease. However, recently a more serious condition characterized by systemic  inflammation with clinical or microbiological evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2  has been described. This syndrome is now known as either ""Pediatric Inflammatory  Multisystem Syndrome temporally related with COVID-19"" (PIMS-TS) (1), or  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) (2) and is currently  considered a rare post-COVID-19 complication which, in a minority of cases, can  lead to death. The signs and symptoms of PIMS-TS are largely overlapping with  the for Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and are characterized, by fever, systemic inflammation, abdominal pain and cardiac  involvement. In this study, we describe clinical and immunological  characteristics shared by PIMS-TS, acute rheumatic fever and TSS, in order to provide hypotheses to direct future clinical and basic research studies.  ,  Context: Although there is still much that is not understood, experience with previous  coronavirus outbreaks and available data on COVID-19 indicate a reduced  propensity to affect children. Nonetheless, serious complications—although  rare—are being seen in pediatric patients. This review, written with the  emergency medicine clinician in mind, describes the epidemiology, clinical  features, and management implications for COVID-19 in pediatric patients. It  includes a discussion of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  associated with COVID-19, as well as other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that  are affecting children and families, such as poisonings, childhood immunizations, mental health, nonaccidental trauma, and neglect.  ,  Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context:  We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). This adolescent male  presented prior to any known association between COVID-19 and immune mediated inflammatory syndrome in children. He presented in stable condition and without  significant multisystem involvement. During hospitalization, he developed severe  left ventricular dysfunction and mixed hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic shock. Clinical features overlapped with Kawasaki disease, acute rheumatic  fever, and toxic shock syndrome. After centers in Europe began reporting a  multisystem inflammatory condition in children with COVID-19, the patient's  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction. Recommended treatments for MIS-C include intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, and inotropic or vasopressor support.

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,"No, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development at the time of implementation."," Context: long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use. Overall, there was no evidence of  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and  ,  Context: late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was  implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative  feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a  phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using  graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was presented to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory input. Following  regulatory concurrence, DBS was poised for use in further clinical studies.  Population PK modeling was used to dissect sources of variability contributing  ,  Context: Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been  submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy™) is an orally administered, small molecule,  highly-selective, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that was  developed by Allergan under license to Merck & Co. as an acute treatment for  migraine.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context:  Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with  mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%. Despite numerous efforts to  identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an  increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology. The high mortality  rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat. This  article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic  potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment  ,  Context: In 2009 a novel swine-origin Influenza A H1N1 virus was identified in Mexico and  Southern California. Since it was first recognized, neurological complications  including acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) have been globally documented  in association with this viral infection. ANE is mostly known to occur in the  paediatric population. We describe a fatal case of ANE in a previously healthy  40-year-old man infected with influenza A H1N1 virus presenting with severe  neurologic decline. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) findings were consistent with ANE. CT and MR findings typically documented  in paediatric cases of ANE - including bilateral thalamic necrosis with petechial hemorrhage - have been seldom described in adulthood.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context:  SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different  geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah  virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not  match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV),  which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an  animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the  possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused  ,  Context: Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral communicable disease transmitted by an  arbovirus of the Flavivirus genus. It is primarily a zoonotic disease,  especially the monkeys. Worldwide, an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever  occurred each year, and the case-fatality rate is ~15%. Forty-five endemic  countries in Africa and Latin America, with a population of close to 1 billion,  are at risk. Up to 50% of severely affected persons from YF die without  treatment. During 2009, 55 cases and 18 deaths were reported from Brazil,  Colombia, and Peru. Brazil reported the maximum number of cases and death, i.e.,  42 cases with 11 deaths. From January 2010 to March 2011, outbreaks of YF were reported to the WHO by Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire,  Guinea, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Uganda. Cases were also reported in three  northern districts of Abim, Agago, and Kitugun near the border with South Sudan.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last several years, novel immunologic pathways  pivotal in the development of the pathobiology of psoriasis and psoriatic  arthritis (PsA) have been revealed. These discoveries catalyzed a search for new  treatment targets resulting in many new therapies that are now available for  patients with psoriatic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Helper T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (TH17) along with  CD8+ cells, innate lymphocyte cells, and gamma delta T cells are important in  the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Recently, agents that target  interleukin-17, the interleukin-17 receptor, and interleukin-23 (antip19) have been approved or are in clinical trials. Apremilast, a new oral agent, was  approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA. SUMMARY: Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A antibody, has been approved for treatment of psoriasis and PsA in the United States. It is effective with a good  safety profile. Ixekizumab, another anti-interleukin-17A antibody, is currently  in clinical trials and brodalumab, an interleukin-17 receptor antagonist, was  ,  Context: (fenebrutinib and Lou064), a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and dupilumab.

A  multidimensional, chemical genetic screen of 7,392 small molecules was used to  discover ""tubacin,"" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian  cells. Tubacin does not affect the level of histone acetylation, gene-expression  patterns, or cell-cycle progression. We provide evidence that class II histone  deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. Only one of the two catalytic domains of HDAC6 possesses tubulin deacetylase activity, and only  this domain is bound by tubacin. Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability  of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. HDAC6 overexpression disrupted the localization of p58, a protein that mediates binding of Golgi elements to  microtubules. Our results highlight the role of alpha-tubulin acetylation in  mediating the localization of microtubule-associated proteins. They also suggest  ,  Context: Angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cell migration, which was  blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. It has been reported  that angiotensin II is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by  mechanical stretch in endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that endothelial  cells subjected to a 10% uniaxial stretch showed vertical alignment to the  direction of tension and tubulin deacetylation in the peripheral side of cells,  in comparison with control static cells. The mechanical stretch-induced changes  of microtubules were blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion.  Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that acetylated tubulin was decreased in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in the intima of  the aortic walls in mice loaded with angiotensin II, in comparison with mice  loaded with control vehicle. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in  endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced  vascular remodeling.  ,  Context: biochemically distinct steps: initiation and elongation. The length of the  glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific. Here,  we probe the significance of the glutamyl side chain length regulation in vivo  by overexpressing a potent side chain elongase enzyme, Ttll6Ap, in Tetrahymena.  Overexpression of Ttll6Ap caused hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains on the  tubulin of axonemal, cortical, and cytoplasmic microtubules. Strikingly, in the  same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilized cytoplasmic  microtubules and destabilized axonemal microtubules. Our observations suggest  that the cellular outcomes of glutamylation are mediated by spatially restricted tubulin interactors of diverse nature.  ,  Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal  relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by  using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only  pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule  stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in  MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules.  Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of  ,  Context: The fact that histones are modified by acetylation has been known for almost 30  years. The recent identification of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation  has revealed a broader use of this modification than was suspected previously.  Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including  transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation  regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein  interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the  bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling  domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to  phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate  specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation with the process of phosphorylation.

The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing  hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced  prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to  ,  Context: traditional advantages of low cost, high scalability, increased safety, and  eukaryotic protein modification. Novel transient expression vectors have been  developed that allow the production of vaccines and therapeutics at  unprecedented speed to control potential pandemics or bioterrorism attacks.  Plant-host engineering provides a method for producing proteins with unique and  uniform mammalian post-translational modifications, providing opportunities to  develop biologics with increased efficacy relative to their mammalian  cell-produced counterparts. Recent demonstrations that plant-made proteins can  function as biocontrol agents of foodborne pathogens further exemplify the potential utility of plant-based protein production. However, resolving the  technical and regulatory challenges of commercial-scale production, garnering  acceptance from large pharmaceutical companies, and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for several major classes of biologics are essential  steps to fulfilling the untapped potential of this technology.  ,  Context: Australia. hrwheeler@optusnet.com.au.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can exert dual influences on tumorigenesis by either antagonizing or enhancing antitumor responses. However, in most solid cancers, increased infiltration with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor patient"," Context: Macrophages are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and orchestrate  various aspects of immunity. Within tumors, macrophages can reversibly alter  their endotype in response to environmental cues, including hypoxia and stimuli  derived from other immune cells, as well as the extracellular matrix. Depending  on their activation status, macrophages can exert dual influences on  tumorigenesis by either antagonizing the cytotoxic activity immune cells or by  enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions. Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer  ,  Context: Cancer therapy has developed around the concept of killing, or stopping the  growth of, the cancer cells. Molecularly targeted therapy is the modern  expression of this paradigm. Increasingly, however, the realization that the  cancer has co-opted the normal cells of the stroma for its own survival has led  to the concept that the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be targeted for  effective therapy. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated  macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting  ,  Context: Tumorigenesis is not only determined by the intrinsic properties of cancer cells  but also by their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment  (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune  cells in the TME. During initial stages of tumor development, macrophages can  either directly promote antitumor responses by killing tumor cells or indirectly  recruit and activate other immune cells. As genetic changes occur within the tumor or T helper 2 (TH 2) cells begin to dominate the TME, TAMs begin to  exhibit an immunosuppressive protumor phenotype that promotes tumor progression,  metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting TAMs has emerged as a strategy for cancer therapy. To date, TAM targeting strategies have focused on  macrophage depletion and inhibition of their recruitment into the TME. However,  these strategies have shown limited therapeutic efficacy, although trials are  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context:  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune  cells in tumors. TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A high TAM infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  ,  Context: receptor function can contribute to a number of disease states, including  coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and cancer. In this  chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation,  biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In  addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in  oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human  cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for  targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are  described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is essential for hematopoiesis. It regulates the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by controlling the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. Its"," Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context: this expansion, Gfi1b(ko/ko) HSCs retain their ability to self-renew and to  initiate multilineage differentiation but are no longer quiescent and contain  elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Treatment of Gfi1b(ko/ko) mice with  N-acetyl-cystein significantly reduced HSC numbers indicating that increased  reactive oxygen species levels are at least partially responsible for the  expansion of Gfi1b-deficient HSCs. Moreover, Gfi1b(-/-) HSCs show decreased  expression of CXCR4 and Vascular cell adhesion protein-1, which are required to  retain dormant HSCs in the endosteal niche, suggesting that Gfi1b regulates HSC  dormancy and pool size without affecting their function. Finally, the additional deletion of the related Gfi1 gene in Gfi1b(ko/ko) HSCs is incompatible with the  maintenance of HSCs, suggesting that Gfi1b and Gfi1 have partially overlapping  functions but that at least one Gfi gene is essential for the generation of  HSCs.  ,  Context: Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to  ,  Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish.

Gfi1b-null embryos die at  midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice  that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid  specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full  gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to  adulthood. Both the embryonic deletion of Gfi1b by EpoR-Cre and the deletion in  ,  Context: To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B  overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA).

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"Nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility are measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology, providing a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay."," Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq.

Aberrant DNA methylation is observed in various pathologies, such as  cancer. Therefore, there is a great interest in analyzing subtle changes in DNA  methylation induced by biological processes or upon drug treatments. Here, we  developed an improved methodology based on flow cytometry to measure variations  of DNA methylation level in melanoma and leukemia cells. The accuracy of DNA  methylation quantification was validated with LC-ESI mass spectrometry analysis.  The new protocol was used to detect small variations of cytosine methylation  occurring in individual cells during their cell cycle and those induced by the  demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC). Kinetic experiments confirmed that inheritance of DNA methylation occurs efficiently in S phase and  revealed a short delay between DNA replication and completion of cytosine  methylation. In addition, this study suggests that the uncoupling of 5AzadC effects on DNA demethylation and cell proliferation might be related to the  duration of the DNA replication phase.  ,  Context: understood. Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA  methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority  do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription  silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by  5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation  occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly  lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in  vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a  single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a  nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start  site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin  configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is  methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically  ,  Context: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development and  progression of periodontal disease. Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies. We have developed a system for efficient  transposon mutagenesis of P. gingivalis using a modified mariner transposon.  Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome  junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using  Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the  library was produced. Identification of fitness of individual mutants under  specific conditions can be performed by exposing the library to selective  pressures.  ,  Context: DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental  regulation of gene expression. Alterations in DNA methylation are established  contributors to inter-individual phenotypic variation and have been associated  with disease susceptibility. The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA  methylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is  largely unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation across the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the  serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4/SERT) and the X-linked monoamine oxidase A  gene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs and 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n=182).

The variability found in functional gene pathways may  plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample.  Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome  remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in  certain gene pathways.

Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether 2D:4D measures are associated with breast  cancer risk. METHODS: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers  (2D:4D), and right minus left 2D:4D (Δ(r-l)) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants' hands collected during a recent follow-up of the  Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469  women. Of the 9044 women with available data, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a one  standard deviation difference in 2D:4D measures were obtained from Weibull  survival models, and linear regression models were used to examine potential  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current status of emerging therapies  for hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the United States. DATA SOURCES: Summary statements were obtained from each pharmaceutical company  regarding their agent.

RESULTS: Berinert P, a purified, virus-inactivated, human plasma-derived C1  inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate, is being investigated in 2 international,  multicenter, prospective trials. Experience with this agent in Europe and Canada  indicates it is effective and safe. Cinryze is a nanofiltered C1-INH replacement therapy demonstrated to be effective and safe in acute and prophylactic arms of  a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Elevated 2-HG levels are implicated in epigenetic  alterations and impaired cellular differentiation. IDH1 mutations have been  described in an array of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we  report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant  enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to  effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. Preliminary data from phase 1 clinical trials enrolling patients with cancers harboring an IDH1  mutation indicate that AG-120 has an acceptable safety profile and clinical  activity.  ,  Context: effect of these drugs will be limited in vivo by the development of drug  resistance, and pre-clinical studies of G12C inhibitors have identified evidence  of this. In this review we discuss the current evidence for G12C inhibitors, the  mechanisms of resistance to G12C inhibitors and potential approaches to overcome  them. We discuss possible targets of combination therapy, including SHP2,  receptor tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors and PD1/PDL1, and review the  ongoing clinical trials investigating these inhibitors.  ,  Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated Non-compaction Cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is connected to Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) through mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), which are associated"," Context: Cardiomyopathies are classified according to distinct morphological  characteristics. They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis. Aims Autosomal-dominant as well as X-linked inheritance for NCCM has been described and several loci have been associated with the disease.  Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.  Methods and Results We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin  heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the presentation, diagnosis and management of  isolated left ventricular non-compaction in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with progressive symptoms of heart failure. CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are  ,  Context: Accumulating data suggest a link between alterations/deficiencies in  cytoskeletal proteins and the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure,  although the molecular basis for this link remains unclear. Cypher/ZASP is a  cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its  encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of  the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To explore the role of Cypher in myocardium and to better  understand molecular mechanisms by which mutations in cypher cause  cardiomyopathy, we utilized a conditional approach to knockout Cypher, specially in either developing or adult myocardium. Cardiac-specific Cypher knockout (CKO)  mice developed a severe form of DCM with disrupted cardiomyocyte ultrastructure  and decreased cardiac function, which eventually led to death before 23 weeks of  ,  Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM). BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize  ,  Context: New research shows that DNA polymerase θ is a key player in PARP-mediated DNA  damage repair and essential for the survival of cancer cells where homologous  recombination is compromised. Polθ could be a biomarker for PARP-inhibitor  response, and is a potential therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to  these drugs.  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis. When  2-OH-dATP was present at a concentration equal to those of the four normal dNTPs  in the reaction mixture, DNA synthesis by h Poleta enhanced the frequency of  ,  Context: 3'-phosphotransferase kanamycin kinase. The kanamycin resistance gene was  expressed under the control of the promoter(s) of the putative five-gene operon.  The holB gene is essential for bacterial growth and the deletion of holB  exhibits no polar effects on the adjacent genes tmk or ycfH in terms of cell  viability. The method of the holB null construction presented in this work  allows for a simplified studying of interactions between the different subunits  of DNA polymerase III.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of FBN3 gene polymorphism with  abnormal growth pattern in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. Additionally, Rif1 controls"," Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: Normal cellular division requires that the genome be faithfully replicated to  ensure that unaltered genomic information is passed from one generation to the  next. DNA replication initiates from thousands of origins scattered throughout  the genome every cell cycle; however, not all origins initiate replication at  the same time. A vast amount of work over the years indicates that different  origins along each eukaryotic chromosome are activated in early, middle or late  S phase. This temporal control of DNA replication is referred to as the  replication-timing program. The replication-timing program represents a very  stable epigenetic feature of chromosomes. Recent evidence has indicated that the replication-timing program can influence the spatial distribution of mutagenic  events such that certain regions of the genome experience increased spontaneous  mutagenesis compared to surrounding regions. This influence has helped shape the genomes of humans and other multicellular organisms and can affect the  distribution of mutations in somatic cells. It is also becoming clear that the  replication-timing program is deregulated in many disease states, including  ,  Context: Rif1, originally recognized for its role at telomeres in budding yeast, has been  implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes in mammals, including  pluripotency of stem cells, response to double-strand breaks, and breast cancer  development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo  fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. RNA interference to human Rif1 decreases the efficiency of homology-directed repair  (HDR), and Rif1 deficiency results in aberrant aggregates of the HDR factor  Rad51. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric  heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the  repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.

Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Summarize the function of DEAH helicase DHX36 and its role in G-quadruplex-dependent processes.,DHX36 is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase that specifically unwinds DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) with high efficiency and specificity. It disrupts G4s through a conventional helicase mechanism," Context:  G-Quadruplex (G4) DNA (G4 DNA) and RNA (G4 RNA) are secondary nucleic acid  structures that have multiple roles in vital cellular processes. G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We  ,  Context:  Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing  and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two  main G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4  affinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context: results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the  function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context: extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36  loads onto the extension and translocates 3'-5' toward the G4. DHX36 unwound  dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly,  we observed that DHX36 has striking 3'-extension sequence preferences that  differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from  differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results  indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is  tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on  the 3'-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s may not track directly with G4 stability.  ,  Context: The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to  maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation  initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent  helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental  mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4  substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4  substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of  the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between  the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by  DHX36.

In this work, we  also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak  calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are  measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is  particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the  design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and  whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs  abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can  also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo  transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for  species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has  ,  Context: Data analysis in proteomics is complex and with the extra challenges involved in  the interpretation of data from N-terminomics experiments, this can be  daunting.Therefore, we have devised a rational pipeline of steps to approach  N-terminomics data analysis in a statistically based and valid manner. We have  automated these steps in CLIPPER, an add-on to the Trans-Proteomic  Pipeline(TPP). Applying CLIPPER to the analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high  confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization  and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.  ,  Context: from diverse HTS experiments: ChIP-Seq, either punctuated or broad signals,  CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. We prove the effectiveness of Pyicos to select for  significant signals and show that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes  superior to that of methods specifically designed for each particular type of  experiment. Pyicos facilitates the analysis of a variety of HTS datatypes  through its flexibility and memory efficiency, providing a useful framework for  data integration into models of regulatory genomics.

Taking the average size of DNA fragments subjected to sequencing  into account, the software calculates single-nucleotide read-enrichment values.  After normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the  ratio test or the Poisson distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the  false discovery rate are obtained through random permutations. Computational  efficiency is achieved by implementing the most time-consuming functions in C++  and integrating these in the R package. An analysis of simulated and  experimental ChIP-seq data is presented to demonstrate the robustness of our method against PCR-artefacts and its adequate control of the error rate. CONCLUSIONS: The software ChIP-seq Analysis in R (CSAR) enables fast and  accurate detection of protein-bound genomic regions through the analysis of ChIP-seq experiments. Compared to existing methods, we found that our package  shows greater robustness against PCR-artefacts and better control of the error  rate.  ,  Context: tumors and the redundancy of the genetic code. We reanalyzed sequence data for  623 candidate genes in 188 non-small cell lung tumors using the new method. We  found several important genes like PTEN, which were not deemed significant by  the previous method. At the same time, we determined that some genes previously  reported as drivers were not significant by the new analysis because mutations  in these genes occurred mainly in tumors with large background mutation rates.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho (Gro) protein is a transcriptional co-repressor that directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3 and does not bind DNA directly, but is recruited by a diverse profile"," Context: Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that  directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies  suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive  reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and  the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this  study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated  repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a  target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific lysines within the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Gro overexpression  leads to wing patterning defects and ectopic repression in the wing disc of  transcription directed by the vestigial quadrant enhancer. These effects are  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context: expedited in a more tractable model organism, such as Drosophila melanogaster.  To this end, we defined a set of 1,119 putative lincRNA genes in D. melanogaster  using modENCODE whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. A large majority (1.1 of 1.3  Mb; 85%) of these bases were not previously reported by modENCODE as being  transcribed. Significant selective constraint on the sequences of these loci  predicts that virtually all have sustained functionality across the Drosophila  clade. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles  that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation  of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. We identify lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in  male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified  whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between D. melanogaster and mouse. This study predicts that the genomes of not only  vertebrates, such as mammals, but also an invertebrate (fruit fly) harbor large  numbers of lincRNA loci. Our findings now permit exploitation of Drosophila  ,  Context: Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to  mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. We  describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE  information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and  splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main  types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins. Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits  were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for  editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts  are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely  membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological  ,  Context: The proteins termed TLE in humans, Grg in mice and Groucho in Drosophila  constitute a family of transcriptional corepressors. In mammalians there are  five different genes encoding an even larger number of proteins. Interactions  between these TLE/Grg proteins and an array of transcription factors has been  described. But is there any specificity? This review tries to make a case for a  non-redundant function of individual TLE/Grg proteins. The specificity may be brought about by a tightly controlled temporo-spatial expression pattern,  post-translational modifications, and subtle structural differences leading to  distinct preferences for interacting transcription factors. A confirmation of this concept will ultimately need to come from genetic experiments.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Antacids, catecholamines, diuretics, bisphosphonates, intravenous iron formulations, imatinib, and certain anticancer drugs such as platinum-containing drugs, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, ep"," Context: frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This  review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To provide an outline of the drugs and nutritional therapy that could  contribute to the development of hypophosphatemia in the critically ill patient. DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary  literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected. Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism.

He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating  drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context: Contemporary intravenous iron formulations allow administration of high doses of  elemental iron and enable correction of total iron deficit in one or two  infusions. An important but underappreciated complication of certain  formulations is hypophosphatemia caused by increased secretion of the  phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). The pathophysiology  of FGF23-induced hypophosphatemia due to certain intravenous iron formulations  has been recently investigated in prospective clinical trials. To reach the  correct diagnosis, clinicians must recognize the typical clinical manifestations  of intravenous iron-induced hypophosphatemia and identify a specific pattern of biochemical changes (hyperphosphaturic hypophosphatemia triggered by high FGF23  that causes low 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D, hypocalcemia and secondary  hyperparathyroidism). Physicians and patients should be aware of hypophosphatemia as a common complication of intravenous iron therapy and  monitor serum phosphate concentrations in patients receiving repeated doses of  specific intravenous iron formulations. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia are  ,  Context: abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine rates of psychotropic  medication use and identify associated child and family characteristics among  children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enrolled in an  autism registry maintained by the Autism Treatment Network (ATN).

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"No, deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. However, PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains."," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: initiation of DNA replication at particular genomic locations. Here we report  that a distinct fraction of replication initiation sites in the human genome are  associated with a high frequency of dimethylation of histone H3 lysine K79  (H3K79Me2). H3K79Me2-containing chromatin exhibited the highest genome-wide  enrichment for replication initiation events observed for any chromatin  modification examined thus far (23.39% of H3K79Me2 peaks were detected in  regions adjacent to replication initiation events). The association of H3K79Me2  with replication initiation sites was independent and not synergistic with other  chromatin modifications. H3K79 dimethylation exhibited wider distribution on chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2  were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a  region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator  that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme  responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: lysine-20 has been implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional silencing, genomic  stability and regulation of replication. We present the structure of the histone  H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide  substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals  that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain  configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product  specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and  Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously  mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product. We therefore predict that other enzymes are responsible for the  tri-methylation of histone H4K20 that marks silenced heterochromatin.  ,  Context: PR-Set7 is the sole monomethyltransferase responsible for H4K20 monomethylation  (H4K20me1) that is the substrate for further methylation by Suv4-20h1/h2.  PR-Set7 is required for proper cell cycle progression and is subject to  degradation by the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the cell  cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that PR-Set7 is an important  downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2) function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity. Aberrant rereplication correlates  with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation  (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or  cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an  artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC)  ,  Context: To determine the effect of a KMT2D deficiency on neoplastic cells, we used  homologous recombination- and nuclease-mediated gene editing approaches to  generate a panel of isogenic colorectal and medulloblastoma cancer cell lines  that differ with respect to their endogenous KMT2D status. We found that a KMT2D  deficiency resulted in attenuated cancer cell proliferation and defective cell  migration. Analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed that KMT2D was  essential for maintaining the level of global H3K4 monomethylation and that its  enzymatic SET domain was directly responsible for this function. Furthermore, we  found that a majority of KMT2D binding sites are located in regions of potential enhancer elements. Together, these findings revealed the role of KMT2D in  regulating enhancer elements in human cells and shed light on the tumorigenic  role of its deficiency. Our study supports that KMT2D has distinct roles in neoplastic cells, as opposed to normal cells, and that inhibiting KMT2D may be a  viable strategy for cancer therapeutics.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context: 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context:  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb, Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR.

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated.

CONCLUSIONS: Age of onset, tetany manifestations, absence of growth retardation,  hypermagnesuria despite, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria not improved by  furosemide favor the diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome rather than that of  Bartter syndrome initially considered.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Classic Bartter syndrome is a salt-wasting tubulopathy caused by  mutations in the CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb) gene. Although growth hormone  deficiency has been suggested as a cause for persistent growth failure in  patients with classic Bartter syndrome, in our opinion the diagnoses of growth  hormone deficiency has been unconvincing in some reports. Moreover, Gitelman  syndrome seems to have been confused with Bartter syndrome in some cases in the  literature. In the present work, we describe a new case with CLCNKB gene  mutations and review the reported cases of classic Bartter syndrome associated  with growth hormone deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a Japanese boy diagnosed as having classic  Bartter syndrome at eight months of age.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites have been found in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, indicating that RNA editing is particularly common"," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: active-controlled trial. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated  hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5%) receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg)  were recruited from 21 centers in China (from 19 November, 2009 to 15 March,  2011). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients who  reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% between Avandamet and metformin treatment. RESULTS: At week 48, 83.33% of patients reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% in  Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with  significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was reached  in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin treatment. The target of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.1 mmol/L was reached in  26.97% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 19.33% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of FPG ≤7.0 mmol/L was reached in 63.16% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 43.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. Fasting  insulin decreased 3.24 ± 0.98 μU/ml from baseline in Avandamet treatment and  0.72 ± 1.10 μU/ml in uptitrated metformin treatment. Overall adverse event (AE)  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Dosage  ,  Context: the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Andexanet alfa (r-Antidote,  PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) is a truncated form of enzymatically  inactive factor Xa, which binds and reverses the anticoagulant action of the  factor Xa inhibitors (e.g.: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban). Aripazine  (PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) is a synthetic small molecule (~500 Da)  that reverses oral dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, as well as subcutaneous  fondaparinux and LMWH in vivo. These antidotes could provide an alternative for  management of life-threatening bleeding events occurring with the  above-mentioned anticoagulants. In addition, the specific antidote anivamersen (RB007; Regado Biosciences Inc.) is an RNA aptamer in clinical development to  reverse the anticoagulant effect of the parenteral factor IXa inhibitor  pegnivacogin, which is also in development. This anticoagulant-antidote pair may provide an alternative in situations in which a fast onset and offset of  anticoagulation is needed, like in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with  extracorporeal circulation, as an alternative to the heparin/protamine pair.  ,  Context: 2), successful intercourse (SEP3) and change in score on the erectile function  domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients were randomized and 84.6% completed the study.  At baseline 16.1% were age 65 years or older and 71.5% had severe erectile  dysfunction (mean overall IIEF-EF domain score 9.2). After 12 weeks there were  significantly greater increases in SEP2 and SEP3 and change in mean IIEF-EF  domain score with 100 and 200 mg avanafil vs placebo (p <0.01). Following dosing  with avanafil 36.4% (28 of 77) of sexual attempts (SEP3) at 15 minutes or less  were successful vs 4.5% (2 of 44) for placebo (p <0.01). Avanafil was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported and fewer than 2% of  patients discontinued the study due to an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Avanafil in 100 and 200 mg doses was effective and well tolerated in improving erectile function after prostatectomy. Results suggest a rapid  onset of action and sustained duration of effect, with all 3 primary end points  being achieved at both dose levels.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by carrying antisense sequences, offering a long-term effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. This approach has been shown to have therapeutic potential for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy by inducing complete skipping"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context: U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory  elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.  We propose ExSpeU1s as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct, in several human disorders, different types of splicing mutations associated with defective exon  definition.  ,  Context: nuclear bodies including Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs). GEMs contribute to the  biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA), a component of splicing  machinery. The number of GEMs and a subset of U snRNAs decrease in spinal  muscular atrophy, a lower motor neuron disease, suggesting that alteration of U  snRNAs may also underlie the molecular pathogenesis of ALS. Here, we  investigated the number of GEMs and U11/12-type small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  (snRNP) by immunohistochemistry and the level of U snRNAs using real-time  quantitative RT-PCR in ALS tissues. GEMs decreased in both TDP-43-depleted HeLa  cells and spinal motor neurons in ALS patients. Levels of several U snRNAs decreased in TDP-43-depleted SH-SY5Y and U87-MG cells. The level of U12 snRNA  was decreased in tissues affected by ALS (spinal cord, motor cortex and  thalamus) but not in tissues unaffected by ALS (cerebellum, kidney and muscle). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the decrease in U11/12-type snRNP in  spinal motor neurons of ALS patients. These findings suggest that loss of TDP-43  function decreases the number of GEMs, which is followed by a disturbance of  ,  Context: About 70% of C. elegans mRNAs are trans-spliced to one of two 22 nucleotide  spliced leaders.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In fact, mRNA for NMBR was detected in all 14 NSCL"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.  Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context: molecule inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R and related kinases, decreases  microglial numbers by promoting microglial apoptosis in both CSF1 overexpressing  and control mice. Microglia in CSF1 overexpressing mice exhibit gene expression  profiles indicating that they are not basally M1 or M2 polarized, but they do  have defects in inducing expression of certain genes in response to the  inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that the CSF1  overexpression observed in CNS pathologies likely has pleiotropic influences on  microglia. Furthermore, small molecule inhibition of CSF1R has the potential to  reverse CSF1-driven microglial accumulation that is frequently observed in CNS pathologies, but can also promote apoptosis of normal microglia.  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: hypermutation to address the question of target strand symmetry during mutation.  Mutabilities of specific base positions within all triplets were compared  between the two strands of DNA in three divergent databases of hypermutated  sequences. Unexpectedly, we consistently observed strong correlations between  mutabilities of triplet positions on the two DNA strands only for G and T in the  first position of a triplet or for C and A in the last position. The most  straightforward interpretation of this result is that the mutation mechanism  targets either G and T or C and A on both strands of DNA with a frequency that  depends upon the adjacent dinucleotide sequence. In view of published evidence that C is targeted by the hypermutation mechanism, we can extrapolate that C and  A are specifically targeted at a frequency that depends upon the preceding 5'  dinucleotide.  ,  Context: anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes  included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting  their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally  high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D.  melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes  in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated  pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting  coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.  ,  Context:  Microsatellite instability (MSI) is present in hereditary conditions due to  mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations. Following MSI analysis, tumor samples are  classified into MSS (stable), MSI-L (low instability), and MSI-H (high instability) based on the fraction of unstable loci. Another MSI-based  classification takes into account the size difference between mutant alleles in  tumor DNA compared to wild-type alleles; two types of MSI, A and B, are recognized using this approach, type A being characterized by smaller, more  subtle allelic shifts compared to type B. Biallelic mutations of MMR genes are  associated with pediatric cancers, including glial tumors, in Turcot syndrome  ","7723058, 1556753, 8411203, 12943801, 18493055, 19156169","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1; MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, H"," Context: disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type  B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated  with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth  neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context: Inherited neuropathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. At least 28  genes and 12 loci have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)  and related inherited neuropathies. Most causes of inherited neuropathy have  been discovered by positional cloning technique and in the past two years, the  pace of CMT gene discovery has accelerated. Genetic studies have revealed the  following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating  form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal  recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for CMT2 (autosomal dominant axonal form); LMNA, GAN1, KCC3, TDP1, APTX, SETX for  AR-CMT2 (autosomal recessive axonal form); GIB1 for CMTX (X-linked CMT); DNM2  for CMT-DI (autosomal dominant CMT with intermediate nerve conduction  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) constitutes a large group of genetically  heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular  atrophy (dSMA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized almost  exclusively by degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal  part of the limbs. One subtype, dHMN type V (dHMN-V), is transmitted by  autosomal dominant inheritance and predominantly involves the hands. It is  allelic with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2D (CMT2D), in which a similar phenotype is associated with sensory signs. Missense mutations in the  glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with  either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,To provide iodine to the population for very different purposes.," Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the  interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in  existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated  release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again  recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine  thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed  systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can  be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is  negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be  considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the  replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake  is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine  release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: With the global improvement of iodine nutrition, iodine excess is  emerging as a new concern. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to illustrate the physiological effects and potential molecular mechanisms of excessive iodine intake on lipid  metabolism. METHODS: Balb/c mice were given drinking water containing different levels of  iodine for 1 month and treated with 1.2 microg/mL iodine for different periods of time, respectively. Plasma lipid parameters and serum thyroid hormones were  measured. Expressions of hepatic genes were detected by real-time polymerase  chain reactions and Western blot.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Oral iodized poppy seed oil is an appropriate measure for  controlling iodine deficiency in areas where iodized salt is not yet available.  However, a more effective and cheaper iodized oil preparation is needed.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of iodized peanut  oil with that of iodized poppy seed oil. DESIGN: Schoolchildren aged 8-10 y were supplemented with a single oral dose of  iodized peanut oil (P200, P400, or P800 mg I), iodized poppy seed oil (PS400 mg  I), or peanut oil (placebo). The concentration of urinary iodine (UI) was  measured at 0, 4, 12, 25, and 50 wk, whereas thyroid volume and serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine concentrations were measured at 0, 25, and 50 wk. RESULTS: UI was higher in all treatment groups than in the placebo group, except  at baseline. UI in the P200 group was not significantly different from that in the PS400 group at all times of measurement. In a comparison of preparations  supplying 400 mg I conducted by using a mathematical model, iodine retention  from the peanut oil preparation was 3 times that from the poppy seed oil, and  ,  Context:  Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid malignancy after  PTC. There are marked geographical variations in the relative proportions of FTC  and PTC, most likely related to dietary iodine content. In iodine-deficient areas, the relative rate of FTC tends to be increased. Other risk factors for  FTC include age over 50 years and female sex. Genetic factors may also have a  role in determining disease susceptibility but remain ill-defined. Histologically, FTC is characterized by follicle formation and the absence of  any papillary elements in the tumor. Differential diagnosis from a benign  adenoma can be difficult. The degree of vascular invasiveness seems to correlate  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Metastatic thyroid cancers that are refractory to radioiodine  (iodine-131) are associated with a poor prognosis. In mouse models of thyroid  cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists  increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine.  Their effects in humans are not known. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness  to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.

This paper  describes and summarizes the five key questions of human performance modeling:  1) Why we build models of human performance; 2) What the expectations of a good  human performance model are; 3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are; 4) How we integrate a human  performance model with system design; and 5) What the possible future directions  of human performance modeling research are. Recent and classic HPM findings are addressed in the five questions to provide new thinking in HPM's motivations,  expectations, procedures, system integration and future directions.  ,  Context: The ability to achieve site-specific manipulation of the mammalian genome has  widespread implications for basic and applied research. Gene targeting is a  process in which a DNA molecule introduced into a cell replaces the  corresponding chromosomal segment by homologous recombination, and thus presents  a precise way to manipulate the genome. In the past, the application of gene  targeting to mammalian cells has been limited by its low efficiency. Zinc finger  nucleases (ZFNs) show promise in improving the efficiency of gene targeting by  introducing DNA double-strand breaks in target genes, which then stimulate the  cell's endogenous homologous recombination machinery. Recent results have shown that ZFNs can be used to create targeting frequencies of up to 20% in a human  disease-causing gene. Future work will be needed to translate these in vitro  findings to in vivo applications and to determine whether zinc finger nucleases create undesired genomic instability.  ,  Context: by the compartmentalization of medical costs, pharmacy costs, behavioral health  costs, and productivity measures. This situation can be rectified by ""busting""  these silos and promoting a reintegration of prospective costs and parties.  Health risk assessments enable employers to identify illnesses that are suitable  targets for integrated health and productivity management programs. In the case  of depression, employers can act proactively to identify employees at risk,  working to minimize risk factors such as stress before these individuals become  heavy utilizers of company resources. For employees who are currently depressed,  recent research evidence has demonstrated that pharmacotherapy can have a dramatic and positive effect on lost productivity, absenteeism, and  presenteeism. The selection of antidepressants and subsequent follow-up must be  improved, however, if the benefits of pharmacotherapy are to be optimized. CONCLUSION: Understanding the linkage of disease management and productivity in  the workplace can result in dramatic decreases in absenteeism and presenteeism  and increased cost savings to the employers.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: With the resurgence of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and  the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens such as Powassan virus, understanding  what distinguishes vectors from non-vectors, and predicting undiscovered tick  vectors is a crucial step towards mitigating disease risk in humans. We aimed to  identify intrinsic traits that predict which Ixodes tick species are confirmed  or strongly suspected to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens.  METHODS: We focused on the well-studied tick genus Ixodes from which many  species are known to transmit zoonotic diseases to humans. We apply generalized  boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240 species of Ixodes ticks to learn what intrinsic features distinguish zoonotic vectors from  non-vector species. In addition to better understanding the biological  underpinnings of tick vectorial capacity, the model generates a per species probability of being a zoonotic vector on the basis of intrinsic biological  similarity with known Ixodes vector species. RESULTS: Our model predicted vector status with over 91% accuracy, and  ,  Context: of HSCR than those in controls, and the increased NRG1 protein levels in HSCR  were consistent with the mRNA levels. However, no methylation pattern change was  observed in exon 1 of the gene among different groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the aberrant expression of NRG1 may  play an important role in the pathology of HSCR. DNA methylation of the gene  seems not to be involved in the mechanism of such aberrant expression, and other  factors should be explored.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Most cancer patients treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy endure  long-lasting side effects including decrease in concentration, forgetfulness and  slower thinking, which are globally termed ""chemobrain.""

Locomotor activity and depressive-like behavior were assessed using the rotarod and Porsolt's tests, respectively. Changes in cognitive  abilities were determined using the novel place recognition test. RESULTS: Female rats treated with cotinine after chemotherapy, recovered weight faster, showed superior cognitive abilities and lower levels of depressive-like  behavior than chemotherapy, vehicle-treated rats.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Survival of the malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical  Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is dependent on constitutive activation of the nuclear  factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD  is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and known to function as a tumor  suppressor. To determine whether CYLD mutations play a role in cHL pathogenesis,  we sequenced the gene in cHL cell lines and microdissected HRS cells obtained  from lymph-node biopsies. A biallelic inactivation by mutations was found in the  cHL cell-line KM-H2. However, the other seven cHL cell lines analyzed and HRS  cells of 10 primary cHL cases did not show any mutations. By interphase cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase  cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating  decreased CYLD copy numbers were observed in a total of 10 of 29 primary cases. Our results suggest that biallelic CYLD mutations are rarely involved in cHL  pathogenesis. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that KM-H2 cells, besides the CYLD  mutations, also carry inactivating mutations in the genes of two other NF-kappaB  ,  Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an inherited condition characterised by congenital and  developmental abnormalities and a strong cancer predisposition. In around 3-5%  of cases FA is caused by biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Individuals  heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of inherited breast and  ovarian cancer. We reviewed the mutation spectrum in BRCA2-associated FA, and  the spectrum and frequency of BRCA2 mutations in distinct populations. The  rarity of FA due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations supports a fundamental role of  BRCA2 for prevention of malignant transformation during development. The  spectrum of malignancies seen associated with FA support the concept of a tissue selectivity of BRCA2 mutations for development of FA-associated cancers. This  specificity is illustrated by the distinct FA-associated BRCA2 mutations that  appear to predispose to specific brain or haematological malignancies. For some populations, the number of FA-patients with biallelic BRCA2 disruption is  smaller than that expected from the carrier frequency, and this implies that  some pregnancies with biallelic BRCA2 mutations do not go to term. The apparent  ,  Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the  ,  Context: In this work we analyze splicing mutations identified in propionic acidemia  patients to clarify their functional effects and their involvement in the  disease phenotype. Two mutations in the PCCA gene detected in homozygous  patients and involving consensus splice sequences (IVS21+3del4 and IVS22-2A>G)  were shown to produce some normal splicing in patients' cells, at very low  levels, which were quantitated by real-time PCR methods, and which presumably  are sufficient to moderate the phenotype. We have also analysed the effect of  mutations c.653A>G and IVS10-11del6 in the PCCB gene present in heterozygous  patients with mild phenotype. The c.653A>G mutation is located in the last codon of exon 6 and interferes with the correct spliceosomal assembly activating a  cryptic splice site within exon 6, which leads to an in-frame six-nucleotide  deletion (delV217-K218). Minigene analysis and sequence-specific hybridization probes using real-time PCR methods showed that no normally spliced transcript is  detectable in the patients' fibroblasts. The IVS10-11del6 mutation shortens the  polypyrimidine tract of the 3'-splice site of exon 11, resulting in exon  ","20607853, 25186273, 24259538, 22499950, 15235904","Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with progressive microcephaly, seizures, and joint anomalies.",34244665
List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,Med220 and Med70 subunits are part of the CRSP/Med complex.," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: transcription with biochemically separated ARC-L and CRSP reveals differential  cofactor functions. The ARC-L complex is transcriptionally inactive, whereas the  CRSP complex is highly active. Structural determination by electron microscopy  (EM) and three-dimensional reconstruction indicate substantial differences in  size and shape between ARC-L and CRSP. Moreover, EM analysis of independently  derived CRSP complexes reveals distinct conformations induced by different  activators. These results suggest that CRSP may potentiate transcription via  specific activator-induced conformational changes.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate upper urinary tract stone composition rates in  Australia To investigate changes in stone composition in Australia over the past  30 years PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research  (ICPMR) database was used to obtain - stone composition statistics from  2009-2011 Historical comparisons of stone composition rates were obtained from  previous Australian studies; Rofe; 1981, and Baker; 1993 for epidemiological data from the 1970s and 1980s respectively. Stone composition data was separated  into gender and age-groups RESULTS: From the 791 stones analysed between 2009 and 2011, calcium oxalate remains the dominant type accounting for 64% of stones in our dataset, which  compares to 68% from both the 1970s and 1980s. Uric acid stones contributed 16%  of contemporary stone compositions, comparable to 16% in the 1970s and 17% in  ,  Context: coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of  RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and  functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator  complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex  failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference  between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence.  Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals  a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP  or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16 activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator  functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA  Pol II via the CTD.  ,  Context: Intellectual disability (ID) is estimated to affect 1-3% of the general  population and is a common reason for referrals to pediatric and adult  geneticists, as well as neurologists. There are many genetic and non-genetic  causes of ID; X-linked forms are identifiable through their characteristic  inheritance pattern. Current testing methods have been able to identify over 100  genes on the X chromosome responsible for X-linked intellectual disability  (XLID) syndromes. MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations  have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and  MED12 is included in many XLID panels. MED12 is located at Xq13.1 and its product has roles in transcriptional activation and repression.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro."," Context:  Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of  ,  Context: CONCLUSIONS: The rate of SSI following fusion or spinal laminectomy/laminoplasty  was higher during the summer in this network of community hospitals. The  increase appears to be related to increases in SSIs caused by gram-positive  cocci and, more specifically, S. aureus. Given the nonteaching nature of these  hospitals, the findings demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the  summer are more likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than  the July effect.  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to  5,000 nm in size, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. They  are released under physiological conditions, but also upon cellular activation, senescence, and apoptosis. They play an important role in intercellular  communication. Their release may also maintain cellular integrity by ridding the  cell of damaging substances. This review describes the biogenesis, uptake, and detection of extracellular vesicles in addition to the impact that they have on  recipient cells, focusing on mechanisms important in the pathophysiology of  kidney diseases, such as thrombosis, angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, immune  ,  Context: modified in circumscription by adding the Discicristata, a new infrakingdom  comprising the phyla Percolozoa and Euglenozoa). These changes are discussed in  relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as systematics that  concentrates on the higher levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These  principles also make it desirable to rank Archaebacteria as an infrakingdom of  the kingdom Bacteria, not as a separate kingdom. Archaebacteria are grouped with  the infrakingdom Posibacteria to form a new subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising  all bacteria bounded by a single membrane. The bacterial subkingdom  Negibacteria, with separate cytoplasmic and outer membranes, is subdivided into two infrakingdoms: Lipobacteria, which lack lipopolysaccharide and have only  phospholipids in the outer membrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolysaccharides  in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and phospholipids in its inner leaflet. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)  ,  Context:  Cells are able to produce and release different types of vesicles, such as  microvesicles and exosomes, in the extracellular microenvironment. According to  the scientific community, both microvesicles and exosomes are able to take on and transfer different macromolecules from and to other cells, and in this way,  they can influence the recipient cell function. Among the different  macromolecule cargos, the most studied are microRNAs. MicroRNAs are a large family of non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically through its α2 isoform, which associates with stress granules in response to several stressors."," Context: fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique  functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK  activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, overexpression of mutant α-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG  parameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-α2  binding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in SGs. Collectively, our data define the master metabolic regulator AMPK as a  novel SG constituent that also controls their biogenesis.  ,  Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: is an aggregation-prone protein and, given the role of toxic protein aggregates  in neurodegeneration, a toxic gain-of-function mechanism is another rational  hypothesis. Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43  to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that  cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress  granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs  in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in  neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus,  understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the  role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. We propose two models of TDP-43 aggregate  formation. The ""independent model"" stipulates that TDP-43 aggregation is independent of stress granule formation, in contrast to the ""precursor model""  which presents the idea that stress granule formation contributes to a TDP-43  aggregate ""seed"" and that chronic stress leads to concentration-dependent TDP-43  ,  Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of  ,  Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance  ,  Context:  The simultaneous detection of all the post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs)  that decorate cellular RNA can provide comprehensive information on the effects  of changing environmental conditions on the entire epitranscriptome. To capture this type of information, we performed the analysis of ribonucleotide mixtures  produced by hydrolysis of total RNA extracts from S. cerevisiae that was grown  under hyperosmotic and heat shock conditions. Their global PTM profiles clearly indicated that the cellular responses to these types of stresses involved  profound changes in the production of specific PTMs. The observed changes  involved not only up-/down-regulation of typical PTMs, but also the outright  ","25840010, 18775331, 22405725, 25437551, 29298433, 26733207",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA (Poly(A)polymerase-alpha) is a mammalian polyadenylating enzyme that adds poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs, promoting their stability, export to the cytoplasm, and translation"," Context:  Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated  mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted  post-translational regulation. The possibility of translational regulation of this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  ,  Context: random coil form to the α-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase  K-resistant α-synuclein protein. In contrast with the dogma described above, our  recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also  various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by  DGK isozymes. DG species supplied from distinct pathways may be utilized by DGK  isozymes based on different stimuli present in different types of cells, and  individual PA molecular species would have specific targets and exert their own  physiological functions.  ,  Context: factor 1 (CF1) 3' end processing complex subunit Rna15. Here, employing affinity  chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation, we show that TFIIB  associates with poly(A) polymerase and the entire CF1 complex in yeast cells.  The factors required for general transcription such as TATA-binding protein, RNA  polymerase II, and TFIIH are not a component of the TFIIB complex. This  holo-TFIIB complex was resistant to MNase digestion. The complex was observed  only in the looping-competent strains, but not in the looping-defective sua7-1  strain. The requirement of Rna15 in gene looping has been demonstrated earlier.  Here we provide evidence that poly(A) polymerase (Pap1) as well as CF1 subunits Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes.  Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the  mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is  altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1  exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  ,  Context: The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their  stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation. Subsequently, the balance  between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of  translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is  essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to  neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A)  polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to  RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the  turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other small RNAs to modulate their stability or biological functions.  ,  Context: Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a  crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  Recently, new roles for succinate outside metabolism have emerged. Succinate  stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in  specific tumors and in activated macrophages, and stimulates dendritic cells via  its receptor succinate receptor 1. Furthermore, succinate has been shown to post-translationally modify proteins. This expanding repertoire of functions for  succinate suggests a broader role in cellular activation. We review the new  roles of succinate and draw parallels to other metabolites such as NAD(+) and citrate whose roles have expanded beyond metabolism and into signaling.  ,  Context: genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of  developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.

CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: levels. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced  single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and  further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to  structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated  with other R-loops. These observations introduce a new molecular feature of the  FMR1 gene that is directly affected by CGG-repeat expansion and is likely to be  involved in the associated cellular dysfunction.  ,  Context: Pre-mRNA editing involving the conversion of adenosine to inosine is mediated by  adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2). ADARs contain multiple  double-stranded RNA(dsRNA)-binding domains in addition to an adenosine deaminase  domain. An adenosine deaminase acting on tRNAs, scTad1p (also known as scADAT1),  cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a deaminase domain related to the ADARs  but lacks dsRNA-binding domains. We have identified a gene homologous to scADAT1 in the region of Drosophila melanogaster Adh chromosome II. Recombinant  Drosophila ADAT1 (dADAT1) has been expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and  purified. The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater  similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of  a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are  ","25639508, 34565721, 32346735, 19625506, 24743386, 10629039",Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.,25639508
What is etarfolatide used for?,"Etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment."," Context: FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout  treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion  diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized  medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FRα and FRβ in complex with folates  and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and  implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and  inflammatory disorders.  ,  Context: METHODS: We used data from the Queensland Pancreatic Cancer Study, a  population-based case-control study. In total, 704 cases and 711 age- and  sex-matched controls were recruited. Participants completed an interview in  which they were asked about history of NSAID and statin use. We included 522  cases and 653 controls who had completed the medication section of the interview  in this analysis. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to  estimate associations between medication use and pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: We found no consistent evidence of an association between use of NSAIDs  or statins and risk of pancreatic cancer. There was some suggestion of a protective effect in infrequent users of selective COX-2 inhibitors, but no  association in more frequent users. We did not find evidence of protective  effects in analyses stratified by sex, smoking status, time between diagnosis and interview, or presence/absence of metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results do support the hypothesis that use of NSAIDs  or statins may reduce the odds of developing pancreatic cancer.  ,  Context: third-line chemotherapy after disease progression on second-line monotherapy;  and 5) third-line chemotherapy after disease progression on second-line  combination therapy. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all pertinent  uncertainties.  RESULTS: Using costs alone, BSC was the only definitive cost-effective treatment  for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients, and second-line  monotherapy was a reasonable cost-effective strategy with an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 64,104 dollars. The cost-effectiveness ranged  from 4,065 dollars per month of overall survival (OS) for BSC to 12,927 dollars  for third-line previous combination therapy. Compared with BSC, second-line monotherapy gained an additional 3 months of OS, with a cost-effectiveness of  4,703 dollars per month of OS. Second-line combination therapy and third-line  therapies exhibited unfavorable ICER.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies. Diffuse  high-grade gliomas represent approximately 10% of pediatric brain tumors. Exon  sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be  seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse  high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. We performed a pyrosequencing-based analysis for the identification of H3F3A codon  27 and codon 34 mutations in 338 pediatric brain tumors. The K27M mutation  occurred in 35 of 129 glioblastomas (27.1%) and in 5 of 28 (17.9%) anaplastic  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the sensibility of each  imaging tool in identifying focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in children and  adolescents with epilepsy and to define the prognostic factors of pediatric and  adolescent epilepsy surgery. METHODS: We identified 48 children with FCD who underwent resective surgery and  analyzed their preoperative data. The results of various anatomic and functional  neuroimaging studies were compared for accuracy in locating the lesion. We also  investigated clinical factors that affected the outcome of surgical treatment. KEY FINDINGS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was able to localize FCD in 30 patients and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and/or  subtraction ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)  coregistered with MRI provided additional information that helped to define the lesion in 13 patients. When comparing the pathologic results between a mild  malformation of cortical development (MCD) and FCD type I and II, we noted a  strong tendency for patients with FCD to have MRI abnormalities (p = 0.005). In  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Global scale brain research collaborations such as the ENIGMA  (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) consortium are  beginning to collect data in large quantity and to conduct meta-analyses using  uniformed protocols. It becomes strategically important that the results can be  communicated among brain scientists effectively. Traditional graphs and charts  failed to convey the complex shapes of brain structures which are essential to  the understanding of the result statistics from the analyses. These problems  could be addressed using interactive visualization strategies that can link  those statistics with brain structures in order to provide a better interface to understand brain research results. RESULTS: We present ENIGMA-Viewer, an interactive web-based visualization tool  for brain scientists to compare statistics such as effect sizes from meta-analysis results on standardized ROIs (regions-of-interest) across multiple  studies.

CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an  enzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes progressive dementia in children. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of  intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was  initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received  the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a  ,  Context: was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: Rat-bite fever is an uncommon bacterial illness resulting from infection with  Streptobacillus moniliformis that is often transmitted by the bite of a rat. The  cutaneous findings in rat-bite fever are nonspecific but have been described as  maculopapular or petechial. We describe a 9-year-old girl with acrally  distributed hemorrhagic pustules, fever, and arthralgias. Diagnosis was delayed  because of difficulty in identifying the pathologic organism. She was  successfully treated with 10 days of ceftriaxone.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Cerebrolysin is a neuroprotective drug used in the treatment of  acute ischemic stroke. To our knowledge, this drug has never been evaluated in  patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study  was to evaluate the effect of Cerebrolysin in patients with aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: Aneurysmal SAH patients who had their aneurysm obliterated at our  institution from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively studied. Patients received  Cerebrolysin treatment or standard care only (control group). Subgroup analyses  were performed according to Hunt and Hess grade (good grade ≤ 2, N = 216; poor  grade ≥ 3, N = 246) and treatment procedure (clip or coil). RESULTS: In good-grade patients (N = 216), clinical outcomes and mortality did  not differ significantly between the control and Cerebrolysin groups. In  poor-grade patients (N = 246), the mortality rate was significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (8.7%) than in the control group (25.4%, p = 0.006). In  patients who received microsurgical clipping (N = 328), the mortality rate was  significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (7.3%) than in the control group  (18.5%, p = 0.016).  ,  Context: viral infections. Valacyclovir is also compared with acyclovir and famciclovir. METHODS: All published literature containing the word ""valacyclovir"" was  reviewed and summarized.  RESULTS: Valacyclovir is the only oral antiviral agent approved for therapy of  herpes labialis, the only antiviral drug approved for a 3-day course in the  episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral  drug approved for once daily dosing for suppressive therapy. In herpes zoster,  valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir and equally effective as  famciclovir at hastening the healing of zoster-associated pain and PHN. CONCLUSION: Valacyclovir is safe and effective in the therapy of patients with  herpes simplex and herpes zoster and may be useful in other viral infections.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been tested for the construction of several organs, including bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves, skin, heart tissue, and tracheal splints. Additionally, it has been used to generate multilayered skin"," Context: Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is  driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing,  art, education and medicine. Recent advances have enabled 3D printing of  biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures. Other applications include developing  ,  Context: printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on  a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In  this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the production process is demonstrated by producing a set of eyeglass frames from 3D  blueprints.  ,  Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the  regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves  ","25093879, 24288392, 12679063, 12740943, 18154465, 25866560","Nose, ear and meniscus prototypes/constructs have been produced with 3D (3-dimesional) printing.","25641220, 19901446, 24288392, 23822094, 12679063, 24942232, 23635097, 24805923, 25159591, 25197745, 22436025, 23172542, 25387454, 25866560, 12740943, 25281749, 18154465, 25492194, 2087655, 25691496, 25839977, 25093879"
Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2  must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to  take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells  lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs.  Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections.  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important  regulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans.  To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location  profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple  hemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a  gain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202  bound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose  promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol  biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context: factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively  control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12  becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in  increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in  combination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the  transition to filamentous growth.  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are derived from the oropharyngeal carcinoma.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: derived from the oropharyngeal carcinoma (HEp-2). Cytotoxicity tests revealed  that the concentrations of Artepillin C required to reduce cell viability by 50%  (CC50) are dependent on the incubation time, decreasing from 40.7 × 10-5 mol/L  to 15.7 × 10-5 mol/L and 9.05 × 10-5 mol/L considering 12, 24 and 48 h,  respectively. Hydrophobic interactions on neutral species of Artepillin C induce  aggregation over the HEp-2 plasma membrane, given the acid conditions of the  cellular culture. Indeed, Langmuir monolayers mimicking cellular membranes of  tumor cells revealed Artepillin C affinity to interact with  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) containing 20 mol% of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glychero-3-phosphoserine (DPPS), leading aggregation on giant  unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) at pH 3.2. Moreover, leakage experiments on GUVs  have shown that the presence of DPPS enhances the efflux of the fluorescent probe signaling the membrane permeabilization, which is the origin of the  necrotic pathway triggered in HEp-2 cells, as observed by flow cytometry assays.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients  with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have  refractory disease. This study aims at investigating the antitumor,  antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic activities of dovitinib in preclinical  models of HCC. METHODS: 21-0208 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the antitumor effect of dovitinib. Changes of biomarkers  relevant to FGFR/VEGFR/PDGFR pathways were determined by Western blotting.  Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by  immunohistochemistry.

Dovitinib inhibited basal expression and FGF-induced  ,  Context: after the amino acid residues were identified by comparing the sequence of  prestin to those of its paralogs and orthologs. Frog prestin is the only  representative in amphibian lineage and the studies of it were quite rare with  only one species identified. RESULTS: Here we report a new coding sequence of SLC26A5 for a frog species,  Rana catesbeiana (the American bullfrog). In our study, the SLC26A5 gene of Rana  has been mapped, sequenced and cloned successively using RNA-Seq. We measured  the nonlinear capacitance (NLC) of prestin both in the hair cells of Rana's  inner ear and HEK293T cells transfected with this new coding gene. HEK293T cells expressing Rana prestin showed electrophysiological features similar to that of  hair cells from its inner ear. Comparative studies of zebrafish, chick, Rana and  an ancient frog species showed that chick and zebrafish prestin lacked NLC. Ancient frog's prestin was functionally different from Rana.

One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N.

CONCLUSION: The overall survival rate of the implants into the sinus cavity was  95.6%, without statistical differences according to the level of penetration.  The clinical and radiological complications were 3.4% and 14.8% respectively.  The most frequent clinical complication was the epistaxis, and the radiological  complication was thickening of the Schneiderian membrane, without reaching  statistical significant difference according to the level of implant penetration  inside the sinus.  ,  Context: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome or Broad Thumb-Hallux syndrome is a genetic disorder  characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, and mental deficiency.  A seven-year-old girl had come to the Department of Pedodontics, Istanbul  Medipol University, Faculty of Dentistry, Turkey, with a complaint of caries and  bleeding of gingivae. The patient was mentally retarded. Extraoral features  revealed distinctive facial appearance with a broad fore head, hypertelorism,  broad nasal bridge, and beaked nose. Intraoral features observed were talons  cusps in the upper lateral incisors, carious teeth, and plaque accumulation.  Since the patient was mentally retarded, the dental treatment was done under GA. The treatment plan and dental management of this patient are discussed in this  case report.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth,  accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small  percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, there is no indication in the provided text that AGY can be used as an antidiuretic replacement therapy. The text only mentions AGY in relation to a study on celiac disease and its potential benefits for patients with this condition,"," Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD.

Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.  ,  Context: Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare  congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features:  midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary  endocrine dysfunction. We report 5 children with SOD, originally referred to be  evaluated due to short stature, who also presented bilateral optic nerve  hypoplasia, nystagmus and development delay. In 4 of the patients, we identified  neuroimaging abnormalities of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis such as anterior  pituitary hypoplasia (3/5), ectopic posterior pituitary (4/5), thin or absent  stalk (3/5) and empty sella (1/5). We also encountered diverse pituitary deficiencies: growth hormone (3/5), adrenocorticotropic hormone (3/5),  thyroid-stimulating hormone (2/5) and antidiuretic hormone (1/5). Only one child  presented intact pituitary function and anatomy. Although rare, SOD is an important cause of congenital hypopituitarism and it should be considered in  children with optic nerve hypoplasia or midline brain abnormalities for early  diagnosis and treatment.  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context: II and Ang II receptors were examined by immunohistochemistry staining (IHCS) in  72 CKD patients. Their correlations with urinary AGT were also analyzed. We  found that the urinary AGT level was positively correlated with hypertension (ρ  = 0.28, P < 0.01), urinary protein (r = 0.38, P < 0.01), urinary Ang II (r =  0.29, P < 0.05), urinary type IV collagen (Col IV) (r = 0.56, P < 0.01), and was  negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r =  -0.28, P < 0.01), urinary sodium (r = -0.22, P < 0.05) and serum AGT (r = -0.27,  P < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis indicated low serum AGT (P < 0.01), high  urinary protein (P < 0.01), high urinary Ang II (P < 0.05) and high urinary Col IV (P < 0.01) were correlated significantly with high urinary AGT. Urinary AGT  level was positively correlated with intrarenal expression level of AGT (ρ =  0.46, P < 0.01), Ang II (ρ = 0.56, P < 0.01) and Ang II type 1 receptor (ρ = 0.32, P < 0.01), as detected by IHCS. Together, these data suggest that urinary  AGT might be a potential biomarker of intrarenal RAS and Ang II activities in  CKD patients.  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat uterine fibroids (UF), endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer."," Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean  testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per  deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide  group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular  events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard  ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer,  relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was  superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. (Funded by Myovant Sciences; HERO ClinicalTrials.gov  number, NCT03085095.).  ,  Context: relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds,  respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During  treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three  months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin  (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and  increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was  associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin  (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7%  [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and  pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI:  19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin  median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were  similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with  relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated  noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign tumors common in premenopausal  women, with strong impact on the health-care systems. For many years, surgery  represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are  observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical  treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and  in ameliorating patient conditions.  AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment.

For the processing of the resulting short  read data, various tools are utilized. Some of these tools were specifically developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of  RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the  available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed  and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard  dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and  ,  Context: scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of  biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult.  To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and  software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there  is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this  review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from  preprocessing to downstream analysis, along with an up-to-date list of published  studies that involved the application of this method. We expect this review will  provide a guideline for successful data generation and analysis methods using appropriate software tools and databases for the study of chromatin  accessibility at single-cell resolution.  ,  Context:  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care  analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications. Breath analysis  with FT-IR was fast and easy, and no sample preparation was needed. The analyzer was adequately sensitive and accurate in detecting and quantitating clinically  relevant amounts of ethanol and methanol in the breath of seriously ill  patients. FT-IR spectrometry was also suitable for nearly on-line monitoring of the exhaled ethanol and methanol during hemodialysis. The breath analysis  results correlated well with blood samples. The FT-IR method used also has a  traceable calibration to physical properties of the analyte, and the measured  ,  Context: causative mutations and pharmacogenomic marker allele frequencies in various  populations around the globe.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate RNAalifold algorithm for sequence alignment, achieving a speedup of 12.2 over software implementation. Additionally, an FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP, was"," Context: Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP,  Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.  ,  Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context: millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's  computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context: the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  RESULTS: This bit-split organization of the Aho-Corasick implementation enables  efficient utilization of the limited random access memory (RAM) resources  available in typical FPGAs. The use of on-chip RAM as opposed to FPGA logic  resources for FSM implementation also enables rapid reconfiguration of the FPGA  without the place and routing delays associated with complex digital designs. CONCLUSION: Experimental results show storage efficiencies of over 80% for several data sets. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation executing at 100 MHz is  nearly 20 times faster than an implementation of the traditional Aho-Corasick  algorithm executing on a 2.67 GHz workstation.  ,  Context: computers exhibit parallel efficiency of no more than 50%. Field Programmable  Gate-Array (FPGA) chips provide a new approach to accelerate RNAalifold by  exploiting fine-grained custom design.  RESULTS: RNAalifold shows complicated data dependences, in which the dependence  distance is variable, and the dependence direction is also across two  dimensions. We propose a systolic array structure including one master  Processing Element (PE) and multiple slave PEs for fine grain hardware  implementation on FPGA. We exploit data reuse schemes to reduce the need to load  energy matrices from external memory. We also propose several methods to reduce energy table parameter size by 80%. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our implementation with 16 PEs is the only FPGA  accelerator implementing the complete RNAalifold algorithm. The experimental results show a factor of 12.2 speedup over the RNAalifold (ViennaPackage -  1.6.5) software for a group of aligned RNA sequences with 2981-residue running  on a Personal Computer (PC) platform with Pentium 4 2.6 GHz CPU.  ,  Context: levels of triglycerides (TGs) due to failure of chylomicron clearance. It causes  repeated episodes of severe abdominal pain, fatigue and attacks of acute  pancreatitis. There are few current options for its long-term management. The  only universal long-term therapy is restriction of total dietary fat intake to  <10-15% of daily calories (15 to 20g per day). Many patients have been treated  with fibrates and statins with a variable response, but many remain susceptible  to pancreatitis. Other genetic syndromes associated with hypertriglyceridaemia  include familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). Targeting apolipoprotein C3  (apoC3) offers the ability to increase clearance of chylomicrons and other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is as it has not been mentioned in the provided context.," Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroinflammation is an important mediator of the  pathogenesis of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic  mutations such as C9orf72 have begun to define the numerous cell autonomous  pathways that initiate motor neuron injury. Yet, it is the signalling to  surrounding glia and peripherally derived immune cells that initiates the  noncell autonomous inflammatory process and promotes self-propagating motor  neuron cell death. The purpose of this review is to explore the systemic  immune/inflammatory contributions to the pathogenesis of ALS: what are the  peripheral pro-inflammatory signatures, what initiates their presence and do they represent potential therapeutic targets. RECENT FINDINGS: In ALS, motor neuron cell death is initiated by multiple cell  autonomous pathways leading to misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, altered mitochondria, impaired autophagy and altered RNA metabolism, which collectively  promote noncell autonomous inflammatory reactivity. The resulting disease is  characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as peripherally  ,  Context: The field of metabolomics continues to grow rapidly over the last decade and has  been proven to be a powerful technology in predicting and explaining complex  phenotypes in diverse biological systems. Metabolomics complements other omics,  such as transcriptomics and proteomics and since it is a 'downstream' result of  gene expression, changes in the metabolome is considered to best reflect the  activities of the cell at a functional level. Thus far, metabolomics might be  the sole technology capable of detecting complex, biologically essential  changes. As one of the omics technology, metabolomics has exciting applications  in varied fields, including medical science, synthetic biology, medicine, and predictive modeling of plant, animal and microbial systems. In addition,  integrated applications with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics provide  greater understanding of global system biology. In this review, we discuss recent applications of metabolomics in microbiology, plant, animal, food, and  medical science.  ,  Context: between meiotic recombination rate and amino acid composition of certain  residues, which probably reflects the structural and functional dissimilarity  between the hot and cold groups.  CONCLUSION: We have introduced a SVM-based novel method to discriminate hot ORFs  from cold ones.

We describe two brothers from a  non-consanguineous family who have classical features of Goldberg-Shprintzen  syndrome. The novel findings in this instance are of foot anomalies including  camptodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd to 4th toes, which have not been  previously described in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.  ,  Context: Importantly, the combination treatments were effective against BRAF wild type  cancer cells potentially expanding the clinical reach of BRAFi's. In this study,  we identify the antifolate methotrexate (MTX) as a sensitizer of acquired- and  intrinsically-resistant MM cells to BRAFi's dabrafenib and encorafenib. We  identify a novel, positive correlation between dabrafenib treatments and repair  delay of MTX induced single-strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks. Cells arrest in G1 phase  following simultaneous MTX + dabrafenib treatments and eventually die via  apoptosis. Importantly, we identify RAS codon 12 activating mutations as  prognostic markers for MTX + BRAFi treatment efficacy. We describe a method of killing drug-resistant MM cells that if translated has the potential to improve  MM patient survival.  ,  Context: that even the most basic interpretations of this complex microbial assemblage  (species composition, ratio of prokaryotic to eukaryotic proteins, predominant  functions) varied with little overlap based on the protein extraction method  employed.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6," Context: P-gp. The efficacy of desvenlafaxine in treating major depressive disorder has  been established. Adverse events are characteristic of the SNRI class. Notably,  the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events with the 50 mg/day recommended  therapeutic dose is comparable to that seen with placebo. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: incremental benefits with desvenlafaxine, derived from  straight-forward dosing, a simple metabolic profile and lack of interaction with  active transporter P-gp and CYP enzymes may contribute to more consistent  response, good tolerability and lower incidence of drug-drug interactions with  concomitant medications.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: racemosa, Cynara scolymus, Echinacea sp., Ginkgo biloba, Glycine max, Ilex  paraguariensis, and Matricaria recutita) were evaluated for their potential  interactions mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Among the extracts tested,  C. glaziovii (red embaúba) showed the most relevant inhibitory effects of CYP3A4  and CYP2D6 activity, while I. paraguariensis (yerba mate) inhibited CYP3A4  activity. Both extracts were chemically analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS, and these  inhibitory effects could lead to clinically potential and relevant interactions  with the drug substrates of these isoenzymes.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of  delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2  months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug  regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group,  the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid  twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion  (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture  conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in  severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was  reported significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture conversion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for  multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. (Funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development  ,  Context: involving the skin).

The review discusses the most important  interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atemoya (Annona atemoya) is increasingly being  consumed worldwide because of its pleasant taste. However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR (ELAVL1) regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. It also influences cellular behavior, particularly in posttranscriptional RNA regulation, affecting the plasticity of cellular phen"," Context: Posttranscriptional RNA regulation is important in determining the plasticity of  cellular phenotypes. However, mechanisms of how RNA binding proteins (RBPs)  influence cellular behavior are poorly understood. We show here that the RBP  embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1, also know as HuR) regulates the  alternative splicing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear  import factor 1 (Eif4enif1), which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation  factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped  mRNAs. In the absence of ELAVL1, skipping of exon 11 of Eif4enif1 forms the  stable, short isoform, 4E-Ts. This alternative splicing event results in the formation of RNA processing bodies (PBs), enhanced turnover of angiogenic mRNAs,  and suppressed sprouting behavior of vascular endothelial cells. Further,  endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization after hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis in oncogene-induced mammary  cancer, resulting in attenuated blood flow and tumor growth, respectively.  ELAVL1-regulated alternative splicing of Eif4enif1 leading to enhanced formation  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context: down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the  hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.  ,  Context: Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules:  proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical applications, through answering three main questions: (a) What are bacterial  EVs? (b) What are EV impacts on skin inflammatory disease physiopathology? (iii)  What are the possible and expected clinical applications of EVs to treat  ,  Context: patients with FOP and controls and discovered dysregulation of BMP signaling and  rapid osteoblast differentiation in FOP cells compared with control cells. INTRODUCTION: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), the most disabling  condition of progressive heterotopic ossification in humans, is caused by a  recurrent heterozygous missense mutation in activin receptor IA (ACVR1), a bone  morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, in all classically affected  individuals. A comprehensive understanding of FOP has been limited, in part, by  a lack of readily available connective tissue progenitor cells in which to study  the molecular pathology of this disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We derived connective tissue progenitor cells from  discarded primary teeth (SHED cells) of patients with FOP and controls and  examined BMP signaling and osteogenic differentiation in these cells. RESULTS: SHED cells transmitted BMP signals through both the SMAD and p38  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and responded to BMP4 treatment  by inducing BMP responsive genes.

However, their roles in mammalian embryonic development and stem  cell maintenance remained largely uncharacterized. Here we report an essential  requirement of the Pum gene family in early embryonic development. A loss of  both Pum1 and Pum2 genes led to gastrulation failure, resulting in embryo  lethality at E8.5. Pum-deficient blastocysts, however, appeared morphologically  normal, from which embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could be established. Both mutant ESCs and embryos exhibited reduced growth and increased expression of endoderm  markers Gata6 and Lama1, making defects in growth and differentiation the likely  causes of gastrulation failure. Furthermore, ESC Gata6 transcripts could be pulled down via PUM1 immunoprecipitation and mutation of conserved PUM-binding  element on 3'UTR (untranslated region) of Gata6 enhanced the expression of  luciferase reporter, implicating PUM-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of  ","25422430, 19884656, 9763509, 31633842, 17967130, 30256721","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of an organism, specifically in budding yeast."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: constitutive and alternative splicing events, indicating the stronger nucleosome  occupation potential of exon regions. In addition, NOScore valleys present at  approximately 25 bp upstream of the acceptor site in all splicing events. By  defining folding diversity-to-energy ratio to describe RNA structural  flexibility, we demonstrated that primary RNA transcripts from nucleosome  occupancy regions are relatively rigid and those from nucleosome depleted  regions are relatively flexible. The negative correlation between nucleosome  occupation/depletion of DNA sequence and structural flexibility/rigidity of its  primary transcript around splice junctions may provide clues to the deeper understanding of the unexpected role for nucleosome organization in the  regulation of RNA splicing.  ,  Context:  Recent studies indicate that precursor mRNA splicing occurs cotranscriptionally  and that nucleosome positioning may influence inclusion of internal exon  sequences. In eukaryotic genomes, most genes are subject to alternative splicing. Nucleosome occupancy in sequences of different types of alternative  events was investigated by analyzing genome-wide nucleosome positioning data  sets from human. Nucleosomes were found to be preferentially positioned within constitutive exons and/or constitutive portions of alternative exons, which was  not associated with gene expression or states of cells but was based on sequence  and positively related with the sequence conservation of splicing sites. In  ,  Context: A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.

In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in  diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm  filaments and protofilarnents. The periodic repeat is one of the fundamental  characteristic of all intermediate filaments, and demonstrates the half  staggered arrangement of keratin molecules within the filaments.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy  (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. METHODS: Cardiovascular examination was performed in three affected and five  at-risk members of a family from Poland, histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy was done in a single patient, and functional analysis of mutant  desmin protein was carried out in cultured cells.

One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: homeostasis, and the maintenance and controlled transformation of membrane  shapes are coordinated by a large number of different protein assemblies. The  orchestration of spatial elements over distances orders of magnitudes larger  than protein molecules, as required for cell division, is a particularly  challenging task, requiring large-scale ordered protein filaments and networks.  The structure and function of these networks, particularly of cytoskeletal  elements, have been characterized extensively in cells and reconstituted  systems. However, their co-reconstitution with membranes from the bottom-up  under defined conditions, to elucidate their mode of action in detail, is still a relatively new field of research. In this short review, we discuss recent  approaches and achievements with regard to the study of cytoskeletal protein  assemblies on model membranes, with specific focus on contractile elements as those based on the bacterial division FtsZ protein and eukaryotic actomyosin  structures.  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial regulatory roles in  diverse biologic processes, but knowledge of lncRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) is  limited. The aim of this study was to identify lncRNA expression in articular  cartilage and to explore the function of cartilage injury-related lncRNAs  (lncRNA-CIR) in OA. METHODS: To identify lncRNAs specifically expressed in OA cartilage, we compared  the expression of lncRNAs in OA cartilage with that in normal cartilage using  microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. In OA  cartilage, lncRNA-CIR was specifically, differentially, and highly expressed.  The function of lncRNA-CIR was determined by silencing and overexpression in vitro. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-related molecules were detected by qPCR,  Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: Up to 152 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (>8-fold) in OA and normal cartilage (82 lncRNAs more highly expressed and 70 less highly  expressed in OA cartilage than in normal cartilage).

Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known  lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each  lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions  are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets.

Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA  field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological  functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

It is a  minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in the given sequence. In  this article, we review the concept of minimal absent words, which includes the  notion of shortest absent words but is much stronger. We present an efficient  method for computing the minimal absent words of bounded length for DNA sequence using a Trie of bounded depth, representing bounded length factors. This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions. We also present an approach to distinguish sequences of different organisms  using their minimal absent words. Our solution applies a length-weighted index  to discriminate sequences and the results show that we can build phylogenetic  ,  Context: open-source code of our implementation is freely available at  http://github.com/solonas13/maw . CONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being  replaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences  in terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent  words. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm  for the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The problem of finding the shortest absent words in DNA data has  been recently addressed, and algorithms for its solution have been described. It  has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the  existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time.

We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose live oral suspension vaccine.," Context: trials published in English since 2010. ClinicalTrials.gov was used as a source  for unpublished data. Additional data sources were obtained through  bibliographic review of selected articles.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that addressed the safety and  efficacy of Vaxchora, the reformulated, single-dose oral CVD 103-HgR cholera  vaccine, were selected for analysis.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Approval of Vaxchora, was based on efficacy of the vaccine in  human trials demonstrating 90.3% protection among those challenged with V  cholerae 10 days after vaccination and in immunogenicity studies with 90% systemic vibriocidal antibody conversion at 6 months after a single-dose of  vaccine. Tolerability was acceptable, with the most common adverse effects  reported to be fatigue, headache, and abdominal pain. CONCLUSION: Vaxchora is the only FDA-approved, single-dose oral vaccine for the  prevention of cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1 in adult travelers from  the United States going to cholera-affected areas. Safety and efficacy has not  ,  Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost  unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the  end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need.  ,  Context: The half-life is around 8 to 12 hours, with a peak activity 2 to 4 hours after  ingestion. Dabigatran is mainly eliminated via the kidney, hence requiring  dose-adjustment in case of moderate renal insufficiency, and contra-indicated in  case of severe renal insufficiency. Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and  liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are  available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few  interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short  half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote  in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase  their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an  approval has been granted by health authorities.  ,  Context:  Treprostinil is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue with antiplatelet and  vasodilatory properties. It is the only prostacyclin analogue with different  options of delivery, i.e. subcutaneous, intravenous, inhaled or oral. Subcutaneous treprostinil has been shown in short- and long-term studies to  improve exercise capacity, functional class, haemodynamics and survival in  patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pain at the infusion site has been a major drawback of subcutaneous treprostinil, hampering dose  titration, and ultimately leading to increased discontinuation rates.

The Shigella flexneri Invaplex 50 is a macromolecular complex  containing IpaB, IpaC, and LPS, formulated from an aqueous extract of virulent  Shigella delivered via nasal administration. Preclinical vaccine testing  demonstrated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. An open-label dose-escalating  phase 1 study evaluated a 3-dose (2-week intervals) regimen via nasal pipette  delivery. Thirty-two subjects were enrolled into one of four vaccine dose groups  (10, 50, 240, or 480 microg). The vaccine was well tolerated with minor  short-lived nasal symptoms without evidence of dose effect. Antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses were elicited at doses > or =50 microg with the highest IgG  ASC, Invaplex 50 (100%) and S. flexneri 2a LPS (71%), as well as, serologic  responses (43%) occurring with the 240 microg dose. Fecal IgA responses, Invaplex 50 (38.5%) and LPS (30.8%), were observed at doses > or =240 microg.  The Invaplex 50 nasal vaccine was safe with encouraging mucosal immune  responses.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and  we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  ,  Context: TLR7-mediated IFN-α production by human pDCs, which expressed both ESR1 and ESR2  genes. Interestingly, we also found that X chromosome dosage contributed to this  sex bias as female pDCs have an enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α response as  compared with male ones, irrespective of the sex of the recipient mice.  Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X  chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated  IFN-α response of pDCs in women.  ,  Context: translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the  genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In  male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the  translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X  chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate  gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To  confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed  a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our  results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is  responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the cellular abnormalities of B, T and myeloid cells. The up-regulation of TLR7 was  also responsible for driving the infiltration and activation of leukocytes in  the kidney, in which activated T cells were a primary component.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"Slit proteins and NELL1/2 are ligands for Robo family of receptors. Specifically, Slit proteins signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline, while NELL1/2 binds to the first fib"," Context: structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell  surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies provide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a  combinatorial manner required during neuronal development. While a mechanistic  understanding of Slit mediated Robo signaling has advanced significantly further structural studies on larger assemblies are required for the design of new  experiments to elucidate their role in cell surface receptor complexes. These  will be necessary to understand the role of Slit -Robo signaling in  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2.  ,  Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM  ,  Context: metastasis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. The molecular mechanisms  involve signal transduction via mitogen-activated protein kinase and  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, differential expression of multiple genes related  to the listed cell processes, and regulation of activities of other cell surface  proteins, such as vascular growth factor receptors. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid  (tetrac) is derived from T4 and competes with binding of T4 to the integrin. In  the absence of T4, tetrac and chemically modified tetrac also have anticancer  effects that culminate in altered gene transcription. Tumor xenografts are  arrested by unmodified and chemically modified tetrac. The receptor requires further characterization in terms of contributions to nonmalignant cells, such  as platelets and phagocytes. The integrin αvβ3 receptor for thyroid hormone  offers a large panel of cellular actions that are relevant to cancer biology and that may be regulated by tetrac derivatives.  ,  Context: atherosclerotic lesion formation. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) analog, used in  pulmonary hypertension, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory functions.  However, little is known about its role in the MIP-1α production in human  monocytes.  METHODS: We investigated the effects of 3 conventional (iloprost, beraprost, and  treprostinil) and 1 new (ONO-1301) PGI2 analogs, on the expression of MIP-1α  expression in human monocytes. Human primary monocytes from control subjects and  THP-1 cell line were treated with PGI2 analogs, with or without  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Supernatants were harvested to measure  MIP-1α levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To explore which receptors involved the effects of PGI2 analogs on the expression of MIP-1α expression, I  prostanoid (IP) and E prostanoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-r receptor antagonists were used to pretreat THP-1 cells. Forskolin, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activator, was also used to  further confirm the cAMP involvement on the effect of PGI2 analogs in MIP-1α  production.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells, inducing G(1) arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, it inhibits the growth and migration"," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Src has a critical role in tumor cell migration and invasion.  Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase  inhibitor. METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had received one prior  treatment and had measurable disease were enrolled in this phase 2 study. Saracatinib was administered at 175 mg by mouth daily for 28 day cycles until  dose-limiting toxicity or progression as determined by staging every 2 cycles.  The primary endpoint was improvement in 4 month progression-free survival. Design of Thall, Simon, and Estey was used to monitor proportion of patients  that were progression free at 4 months.

This leads to a reduction in and"," Context: demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side  effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to  abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including castration sensitive, biochemically recurrent, or localized disease, and the  rationale for combinatorial treatment strategies of abiraterone with  enzalutamide and other targeted agents are also discussed.  ,  Context: Androgen and the androgen receptor (AR) pathway remain the key targets for  emerging new therapies against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Adrenal androgens and intratumoral testosterone production appear to be  sufficient to activate AR in the castration-resistant setting. This process  re-engages AR and allows it to continue to be the primary target responsible for  prostate cancer progression. Adrenal androgen production can be blocked by  inhibiting cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme for  androgen synthesis in adrenal glands and peripheral tissues. Therapeutic CYP17  inhibition by ketoconazole or by the recently approved adrenal inhibitor abiraterone acetate is the only available choice to target this pathway in CRPC.  A new CYP17 inhibitor, with more selective inhibition of 17,20-lyase over  17α-hydroxylase, orteronel (TAK-700), is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in pre- and postchemotherapy CRPC. In a completed phase II trial in CRPC  patients, orteronel demonstrated its efficacy by lowering the levels of  circulating androgens, reducing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and  ,  Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a syndrome in which patients have raised  serum thyroid hormone (TH) levels and raised or inappropriately normal  thyrotropin (TSH) levels. In general, patients exhibit TH resistance in the pituitary and peripheral tissues. Novel techniques and genetically engineered  mouse model systems have increased our understanding of thyroid hormone receptor  (TR) action, and shed new light on the underlying molecular mechanisms for RTH. In particular, we are learning how mutant TRs from RTH patients can block  wild-type TR function, with consequent effects in various tissues and cells.  This dominant-negative activity has important implications for other  ,  Context: CASE SUMMARY: Our patient was taking warfarin for deep vein thrombosis. The  international normalized ratio (INR) was stable (1.65 to 2.0); however, it  increased to 4.63 after administering favipiravir. The patient had no other  factors justifying this change. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Favipiravir and warfarin might have previously  unidentified drug interactions that elevated the INR. Therefore, INR must be  closely monitored when they are concomitantly administered in COVID-19 patients.  ,  Context: therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis  inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain in the optimization and further understanding of the therapy.  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  The purpose of this study is to report a new and promising method for changing  iris color in a sectorial heterochromia iridis patient. A 22-year-old man with a  complaint of innate color disparity between his eyes presented to our clinic to seek medical advice. He underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination,  including visual acuity, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  measurements, endothelial cell count, and evaluation of iridocorneal angle. The causes of acquired heterochromia were excluded. After a detailed explanation of  the procedure and probable side effects, the patient underwent an application  with a laser device that produces a frequency-doubled 532 nm wavelength Nd:YAG  ,  Context: exhibit an iris disease resembling exfoliation syndrome, a common cause of  glaucoma in humans. Here, Lyst-mutant iris phenotypes were used in a search for  genes that influence Lyst pathways. In a candidate gene-driven approach, albino  Lyst-mutant mice homozygous for a mutation in Tyr, whose product is key to  melanin synthesis within melanosomes, exhibited complete rescue of Lyst-mutant  iris phenotypes. In a genetic background-driven approach using a DBA/2J strain  of congenic mice, an interval containing Tyrp1 enhanced Lyst-dependent iris  phenotypes. Thus, both experimental approaches implicated the melanosome, an  organelle that is a potential source of oxidative stress, as contributing to the disease phenotype. Confirming an association with oxidative damage, Lyst  mutation resulted in genetic context-sensitive changes in iris lipid  hydroperoxide levels, being lowest in albino and highest in DBA/2J mice. Surprisingly, the DBA/2J genetic background also exposed a late-onset  neurodegenerative phenotype involving cerebellar Purkinje-cell degeneration.  These results identify an association between oxidative damage to lipid  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To present a case of iatrogenic Horner's syndrome seen together with  the heterochromia in the post-thyroidectomy period. METHODS: A 23-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints  of low vision in the eye and difference in eye color that developed over the  past two years. In the left eye, myosis and minimal ptosis (∼1 mm) was detected,  and the color of the iris was lighter than the right eye.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,Thyroid hormone regulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. A study found that mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) gene had a 4.4-fold increase," Context:  Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates  ,  Context:  Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to  those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature. Since the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate  and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid  ,  Context: A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on  metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action. A recent study  has discovered that thyronamines can inhibit neuronal reuptake of  neurotransmitters and prevent the intracellular transport of monoamines for  release. This discovery presents a third signaling pathway for thyroid hormone,  expands the role that thyroid plays in the central nervous system, and suggests  mechanisms of action for the effects of thyronamine-derived neuromodulators.  ,  Context: The relation between thyrotoxicosis, the clinical syndrome resulting from  exposure to excessive thyroid hormone concentrations, and the sympathetic  nervous system remains enigmatic. Nevertheless, beta-adrenergic blockers are  widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize how thyroid hormones exert their effects on  lipid metabolism through specific interaction with their nuclear receptors, to  review studies of the effects of new and selective thyromimetic drugs in animals and humans and to identify important questions for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid  hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRβ is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol  and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TRα is most important in fat, muscle, and  heart.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1  ,  Context: suppressor of myogenesis, TIEG1 is also likely to be involved in myogenesis.  Therefore, we investigated the function of TIEG1 during myogenic differentiation  in vitro using the murine myoblasts cell line, C2C12. TIEG1 expression increased  during differentiation of C2C12 cells. Constitutive expression of TIEG1 reduced  survival and decreased myotube formation. Conversely, knocking down TIEG1  expression increased the number of viable cells during differentiation, and  accelerated myoblast fusion into multinucleated myotubes. However, expression of  the myogenic differentiation marker, myogenin, remained unaffected by TIEG1  knockdown. The mechanism underlying these events was investigated by focusing on the regulation of myoblast numbers after induction of differentiation. The  knockdown of TIEG1 led to changes in cell cycle status and inhibition of  apoptosis during the initial stages of differentiation. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses showed that the regulators of cell cycle progression were highly  expressed in TIEG1 knockdown cells. Therefore, TIEG1 is a negative regulator of  the myoblast pool that causes inhibition of myotube formation during myogenic  differentiation.  ,  Context:  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is mainly caused by mutations in the KRT5  and KRT14 genes. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents the second most  frequent skin neoplasia with complex aetiology. The molecular events disrupting the orchestrated interplay between the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules and  signalling proteins are ill understood in SCC. We describe the molecular  background and the unusual course of the disease in a patient with EBS Dowling-Meara, severe keratoderma and a massive verrucous carcinoma. Skin and  tumour samples from the patient were analysed using light microscopy,  immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence mapping. Mutation analysis of the  ,  Context: The impressive selectivity and efficacy of BH3 mimetics for treating cancer has  largely been limited to BCL-2 dependent hematological malignancies. Most solid  tumors depend on other anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, for survival.  The recent description of S63845 as the first specific and potent MCL-1  inhibitor represents an important therapeutic advance, since MCL-1 is not  targeted by the currently available BH3 mimetics, Navitoclax or Venetoclax, and  is commonly associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we confirm a high  binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in  MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and  solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell  lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of  these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated  further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3  ,  Context: Star-PAP is a nuclear non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (PAP) that shows  specificity toward mRNA targets. Star-PAP activity is stimulated by lipid  messenger phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphoshate (PI4,5P2) and is regulated by  the associated Type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that synthesizes  PI4,5P2 as well as protein kinases. These associated kinases act as coactivators  of Star-PAP that regulates its activity and specificity toward mRNAs, yet the  mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a  phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the  domain required for PIPKIα interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by CKIα within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and  interaction with PIPKIα. Unlike the CKIα mediated phosphorylation at the  catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKIα activity.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) include mTOR, rictor, mLST8, sin1, protor-1, and protor-2."," Context: the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of  cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably  associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We  demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional  complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP  activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7  is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of  TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the  localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy,  and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are suppressors of mechanistic  target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is the major component of two protein  complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Inactive mutation of either TSC1  or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor  syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of  αB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts,  Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant  Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis  nodules. αB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling cascade. The augmented  αB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance  of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of αB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced αB-crystallin has an  essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and  inhibition of αB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC.  ,  Context:  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1.

Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts.

Many men undergo opportunistic screening, but the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing as a screen for prostate cancer is contentious. A study found that 81% of general practitioners"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: To review evidence regarding the potential introduction of prostate  cancer screening programmes and highlight issues pertinent to the management of  screen-detected prostate cancer. METHODS: Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial health care issue in  general and urological practice. A PubMed database search was performed,  followed by a systematic review of the literature, to examine the evidence base underlying prostate cancer screening. RESULTS: A prostate cancer screening programme should satisfy several key  postulates prior to its introduction. To date, several of these postulates have  ,  Context: CONCLUSION: This study indicates that PSA testing in asymptomatic men is a  regular occurrence in the UK, and that there is general support from GPs for the  current policy of making PSA tests available to 'informed' men who are concerned  about prostate cancer. While most GPs indicated they would discuss the benefits  and limitations prior to PSA testing, and most GPs favoured a shared approach to  decision making, it is not known to what extent men are actually being informed.  Research is needed to evaluate the most effective approach to assisting men in  making an informed decision about whether or not to have a PSA test.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen  (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated  ,  Context:  National guidance (executive letter) EL(97)12 stated that population screening  should not be provided by the NHS, or be offered to the public until there is  effective screening technology for prostate cancer. The study set out to determine the views of general practitioners and, indirectly, their practice  staff on prostate cancer screening in primary care upon receiving EL(97)12. This  postal questionnaire survey reveals that 81% (95% CI 75% to 87%) of responding general practitioners in North Staffordshire agreed with EL(97)12 and one in ten  said that the executive letter changed their views, suggesting that such  national guidance has an effect.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a  screen for prostate cancer is contentious. Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study  investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values.  RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents) are--3.5 ng/ml for 50 - 59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60 - 69 year olds and 6.5  ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58%, 200/346) of respondents were aware  of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20% (n = 69/346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68%, n = 234/346) used higher PSA cut-offs than  recommended by the DoH.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is involved in autoimmune thyroid disease. It aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease, and even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."," Context: It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest  ,  Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context: specific alleles--aside from a few common human leukocyte antigen class II  genes--had been identified that clearly associate with multiple different  autoimmune diseases. In this study, we describe a unique collection of 265  multiplex families assembled by the Multiple Autoimmune Disease Genetics  Consortium (MADGC). At least two of nine ""core"" autoimmune diseases are present  in each of these families. These core diseases include rheumatoid arthritis  (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple  sclerosis (MS), autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto thyroiditis or Graves  disease), juvenile RA, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, and primary Sjogren syndrome. We report that a recently  described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W)  in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto  thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele. These  findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all,  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and  deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive  span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking,  radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a  role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain  drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the  development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland. Further research is  warranted into the importance of fetal microchimerism and of viral infections  capable of mounting an endogenous interferon-alpha response.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Yes, ospemifene is effective for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. In a 12-week study, ospemifene was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing"," Context: moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective  estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term  studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal  women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing  symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the  effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient  preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not  available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide  sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus  and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However,  endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There  ,  Context: vaginal epithelium. This review focuses on ospemifene including its  pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy and safety. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The paper provides information on the  phamacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ospemifene. It also contains an  overview of its preclinical and clinical efficacy as well as its clinical  safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: From this paper, the reader will gain an appreciation  for a new non-hormonal estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, ospemifene. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The pharmacologic properties of ospemifene make it a logical  candidate for the treatment of women with moderate to severe symptoms of VVA associated with menopause. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are  well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index  and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including  dyspareunia.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel  selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal  atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and  physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo. A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years  who self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis  of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of ospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy  of ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells,  vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of  parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent  ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also  called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for  the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women. METHODS: Two open-label, Phase 1 studies were conducted to determine the  pharmacokinetics of ospemifene in healthy postmenopausal women. In the single-dose study, 60 mg of [3H]-ospemifene was orally administered to 6  subjects. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected predose and serially up  to 240 hours postdose. In the multiple-dose study, 12 subjects received 60 mg of ospemifene once daily for 9 days.

QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The drug is approved  in the USA, and application for EU regulatory approval is underway. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first  approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  ,  Context: were having 5% or less superficial cells on the vaginal smear (maturation  index), vaginal pH greater than 5.0, and at least one moderate or severe symptom  of vulvovaginal atrophy. The four coprimary endpoints were the change from  baseline to 12 weeks in the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells on the  vaginal smear, change in vaginal pH, and change in severity of most bothersome  symptom (vaginal dryness or dyspareunia) compared with placebo. All participants  were given a nonhormonal vaginal lubricant for use as needed. RESULTS: Ospemifene was statistically significantly superior to placebo in each  of the coprimary endpoints at the 60-mg dose. Statistically significant results were achieved for all coprimary endpoints with the 30-mg dose except for  dyspareunia. Ospemifene was well tolerated at both doses and demonstrated a  favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with  vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the  upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and  hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation  significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased  egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of  sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3- and 9.6-fold  increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these  findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C.  elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals.  Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively  regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns  using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that  these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that  MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different  subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different  functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and  localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires  VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also  function as positive regulators of biological processes.  ,  Context: RNA editing increases transcriptome diversity through post-transcriptional  modifications of RNA. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the  adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in  higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but  their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans  at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a new computational pipeline with a ""bisulfite-seq-mapping-like"" step and achieved  a threefold increase in identification sensitivity. A total of 99.5% of the  47,660 A-to-I editing sites were found in clusters. Of the 3080 editing clusters, 65.7% overlapped with DNA transposons in noncoding regions and 73.7%  could form hairpin structures.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Calcium (Ca2+) handling proteins are known to play a pivotal role in  the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy. However little is known about early  changes in the diabetic heart and the impact of insulin treatment (Ins). METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats treated with or without insulin (ZDF ± Ins,  n = 13) and lean littermates (controls, n = 7) were sacrificed at the age of  19 weeks. ZDF + Ins (n = 6) were treated with insulin for the last 6 weeks of life. Gene expression of Ca2+ ATPase in the cardiac sarcoplasmatic reticulum  (SERCA2a, further abbreviated as SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) were determined  by northern blotting. Ca2+ transport of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) was  ,  Context: 10(-5) M Ca2+) and was accompanied by changes in the protein composition and  phospholipid contents of the microsomal fraction. The defect in calcium  transport in microsomal vesicles was not evident until 28 days after  streptozotocin (65 mg/kg iv) injection, whereas increases in plasma glucose  levels due to insulin-deficiency occurred within 3 days. All changes in function  and composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum were reversed by insulin  administration to the diabetic rats. Although the plasma level of thyroid  hormone was decreased in the diabetic rat, thyroid hormone treatment did not  restore microsomal calcium transport in the diabetic animals. The results of this study provide some evidence that the depression in cardiac sarcoplasmic  reticular calcium accumulation during diabetes is a consequence of insulin  deficiency and associated chronic metabolic changes but the hypothyroid condition that accompanies experimental diabetes does not appear to play any  role in this defect.  ,  Context: Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into  focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular  tachyarrhythmias. Calcium overload and spontaneous calcium release from the  sarcoplasmatic reticulum are regarded as possible initiations of early and  delayed afterdepolarization thereby triggering ventricular arrhythmias. In  chronic heart failure, calcium overload is more likely to occur compared with healthy hearts, which is one explantation for the increased vulnerability in  this condition. L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX), and  ryanodine receptor are crucial for calcium homeostasis and therefore represent potential targets for antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Experimental studies have  proven beneficial effects for all these three mechanisms in prevention and  suppression of tachyarrhythmias. However, clinical data is mainly available for  ","3850773, 18570267, 22590623, 22621761, 6134470, 22673935",Yes.,"8864644, 8761317, 3384188, 22402252, 3850773, 10359740"
What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.," Context: FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These  functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems,  ,  Context: of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase  (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN expression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.  ,  Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents. Both  preclinical and clinical studies of this drug provide the significant protection  of hematopoietic progentitors from a broad range of cytotoxic agents such as  cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vinblastine, carboplatin, mitomycin-C, fotemustine,  doxorubicin, daunorubicin and radiation as well. Moreover, this drug can protect  other normal organs or tissues including kidney, salivary gland, liver, heart,  lung and small intestine. Amifostine is quite safe, the two major side effects  are vomiting and hypotension, and the minor effects are flushing, sneezing,  dizziness, chills, metallic taste etc. The drug was approved by the FDA of U.S.A. for use as a cytoprotectant in cyclophosphamide and cisplatin treatment  for advanced ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer.  ,  Context: On May 23, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a treatment  for cancer patients with positive microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)  markers or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) markers. This approach is the first  approved tumor treatment using a common biomarker rather than specified tumor  locations in the body. FDA previously approved Keytruda for treatment of several  types of malignancies, such as metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory Hodgkin  lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma, all of which carry positive programmed  death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 biomarkers. Therefore, indications of Keytruda significantly expanded. Several types of malignancies are disclosed by MSI-H  status due to dMMR and characterized by increased neoantigen load, which elicits  intense host immune response in tumor microenvironment, including portions of  ,  Context: experience both fewer side effects and drug-drug interactions.

Recently approved FDCs, such as atazanavir (ATV)/COBI  (Evotaz; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), darunavir (DRV)/COBI (Prezcobix;  Janssen Products, Titusville NJ), and FTC/TAF (Descovy; Gilead), are also now available. The Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for  HIV recommend many of these integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) STRs as  a preferred choice for initiation of treatment in both ART-naive and -experienced patients because they offer comparably faster rates of virologic  suppression, reduced rates of resistance development (especially with DTG), and  overall better adherence than protease inhibitors or NNRTIs.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and its high binding density defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes. It transduces signals from transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery at"," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: Cohesin is a DNA-binding protein complex that is essential for sister chromatid  cohesion and facilitates the repair of damaged DNA. In addition, cohesin has  important roles in regulating gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms of  this function are poorly understood. Recent experiments have revealed that  cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger  transcription factor CTCF. At a few loci CTCF has been shown to function as an  enhancer-blocking transcriptional insulator, and recent observations indicate  that this function depends on cohesin. Here we review what is known about the  roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF.  ,  Context: cell cycle, the physiologic significance of YY1 activity has recently been  applied to models of tumor biology. The majority of the data are consistent with  the hypothesis that YY1 overexpression and/or activation is associated with  unchecked cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, tumorigenesis  and metastatic potential. Studies involving hematopoetic tumors,  epithelial-based tumors, endocrine organ malignancies, hepatocellular carcinoma,  and retinoblastoma support this hypothesis. Molecular mechanisms that have been  investigated include YY1-mediated downregulation of p53 activity, interference  with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, alteration in c-myc and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression, regulation of death genes and gene products, and  differential YY1 binding in the presence of inflammatory mediators. Further,  recent findings implicate YY1 in the regulation of tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutics and immune-mediated apoptotic stimuli. Taken together, these  findings provide strong support of the hypothesis that YY1, in addition to its  regulatory roles in normal biologic processes, may possess the potential to act  ","24998386, 27773677, 29209056, 31209209, 19308701, 16314846","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.","29209056, 26240385, 24824069, 27773677, 28575439, 27742736, 24998386, 33176147, 31209209, 31211995, 29157917"
Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Yes, colistin is mentioned as a broad spectrum antibiotic in the text, specifically in relation to its use against ESKAPE pathogens and its potential toxicity."," Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics. It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: Biosimilars, which are copy versions of currently licensed biological agents,  will be soon available. The biosimilar of infliximab is as effective and as safe  as its originator in rheumatologic conditions, while a new anti-TNF agent,  namely golimumab, has been recently approved for refractory ulcerative colitis.  Beyond TNF blockers, anti-adhesion molecules appear to be a potent drug class  for IBD. Vedolizumab was recently approved for both Crohn's disease and  ulcerative colitis. Numerous other compounds are in the pipeline. Ustekinumab  looks very promising for Crohn's disease. Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide might  enrich our armamentarium if preliminary data are confirmed in upcoming clinical trials. Herein, we review the efficacy and safety of new and emerging biological  agents that are currently investigated in IBD clinical trials.  ,  Context: bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of  Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira  guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus  callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are  presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of  microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our  knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.  ,  Context:  Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon,  characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation and blood-mixed diarrhea. The main  treatment has been 5-aminosalicylic acid, steroid, thiopurine, and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antibodies including infliximab, adalimumab, and  golimumab. Golimumab, a new anti-TNF-α agent has been recently approved for  patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in line with infliximab and adalimumab in preclinical and  clinical studies. This review will focus on golimumab therapy in ulcerative  colitis.
