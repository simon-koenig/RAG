Elephant ears are made of a very thin layer of skin stretched over cartilage and a rich network of blood vessels . On hot days, elephants will flap their ears constantly, creating a slight breeze.

Differences in the ear sizes of African and Asian elephants can be explained, in part, by their geographical distribution, Context:  The ears are also used in certain displays of aggression and during the males' mating period.

Mayr 2005) think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three, Context: Taxonomy: Clarke et al.
