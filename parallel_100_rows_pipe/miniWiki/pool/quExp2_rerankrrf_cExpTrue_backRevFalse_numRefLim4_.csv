Some of the beetles found within dung and carrion are in fact predatory, such as the clown beetles, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects, Context:  The larva is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle life cycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources . Examples of internal feeders are most Buprestidae and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles) .

In 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with Fermat on the subject, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities  .

From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the PensÃ©es) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life .

This contrasts dramatically with the pattern seen in attacks by rabid wolves, where up to 40 people could be bitten in the same attack.

Research in a conservation area in Kenya shows similar territory sizes and sex differential: 32.8 kmÂ² ranges for males, on average, and 14 kmÂ² for females  .    In Nepal, somewhat larger male ranges have been found at about 48 kmÂ², while female ranges are in-keeping with other research, at 17 kmÂ²; female home territories were seen to decrease to just five to seven kmÂ² when young cubs were present, while the sexual difference in range size seemed to be in positive proportion to overall increase  .     However, significant variations in size of home territories have been suggested across the leopard's range . In Namibia, for instance, research that focussed on spatial ecology in farmlands outside of protected areas found ranges that were consistently above 100 kmÂ², with some more than 300 kmÂ²; admitting that their data were at odds with others', the researchers also suggested little or no sexual variation in the size of territories .  Virtually all sources suggest that males do have larger ranges, Context:  A male may follow a female who catches his attention. Eventually fighting for reproductive rights can take place. Depending on the region, leopards may mate all year round (Asia and Africa) or seasonally during January to February (Manchuria and Siberia) .

Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver  . Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with brine into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The electric pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine .
