Today, however, the pressures humans have put on the wild elephant populations, from poaching to habitat destruction, mean that the elderly often die at a younger age, leaving fewer teachers for the young., Context:  The harvest of elephants, both legal and illegal, has had some unexpected consequences on elephant anatomy as well . African ivory hunters, by killing only tusked elephants, have given a much larger chance of mating to elephants with small tusks or no tusks at all .

Elephant ears are made of a very thin layer of skin stretched over cartilage and a rich network of blood vessels . On hot days, elephants will flap their ears constantly, creating a slight breeze. This breeze cools the surface blood vessels, and then the cooler blood gets circulated to the rest of the animal's body . The hot blood entering the ears can be cooled as much as ten degrees Fahrenheit before returning to the body.
