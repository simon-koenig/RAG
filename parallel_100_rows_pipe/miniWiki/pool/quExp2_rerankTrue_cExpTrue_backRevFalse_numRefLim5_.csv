Wood (2006) has maintained that Adams had become intellectually irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified . By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous and searching debate as well as shaping experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical conception of politics which understood government as a mirror of social estates, Context:  At that time several Congressmen turned to Adams for advice about framing new governments .  Adams tired of repeating the same thing, and published the pamphlet Thoughts on Government (1776), which was subsequently influential in the writing of many state constitutions . Many historians argue that Thoughts on Government should be read as an articulation of the classical theory of mixed government.
