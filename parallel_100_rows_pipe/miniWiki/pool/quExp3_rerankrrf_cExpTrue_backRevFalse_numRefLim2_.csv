Why do wolves howl?,"Yes, wolves howl for communication. They often howl more frequently during the breeding season and when rearing pups. Young pups start howling soon after emerging from their dens to communicate with pack members. As wolves grow older","Context: . Wolves also growl at other wolves while being aggressively dominant. Wolves bark when nervous or when they want to warn other wolves of danger  . Wolves bark very discreetly, and will not generally bark loudly or repeatedly as dogs do; rather, they use a low-key, breathy ""whuf"" sound to immediately get attention from other wolves. Wolves also ""bark-howl"" by adding a brief howl to the end of a bark  . Wolves bark-howl for the same reasons they normally bark. Generally, pups bark and bark-howl much more frequently than adults, using these vocalizations to cry for attention, care, or food. A lesser known sound is the rally . Wolves will gather as a group and, amidst much tail-wagging and muzzle licking, emit a high-pitched wailing noise interspersed with something similar (but not the same as) a bark. Rallying is often a display of submission to an alpha by the other wolves .  Rally to Seneca + important information about Norwegian wolves, Wolfpaper Picture Archive (February 7, 2001)  Wolves also whimper, usually when submitting to other wolves, Context: . Studies also show that wolves howl more frequently during the breeding season and subsequent rearing process  . The pups themselves begin howling soon after emerging from their dens and can be provoked into howling sessions easily over the following two months  . Such indiscriminate howling usually is intended for communication, and does not harm the wolf so early in its life.  Howling becomes less indiscriminate as wolves learn to distinguish howling pack members from rival wolves","1069, 1067","Howling helps pack members keep in touch, allowing them to communicate effectively in thickly forested areas or over great distances. Howling also helps to call pack members to a specific location. Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory, as shown in a dominant wolf&apos;s tendency to respond to a human imitation of a ""rival"" wolf in an area the wolf considers its own. ",
Why is it beneficial for alpha males and females to forcefully prevent other wolves from mating?,"Yes, it's beneficial because a pack can typically only support one litter per year. By preventing other wolves from mating, the alphas ensure that the pack's resources aren't stretched too thin, which helps increase the chances of","Context: Generally, mating occurs between January and April â the higher the latitude, the later it occurs.  A pack usually produces a single litter unless the alpha male mates with one or more subordinate females  . During the mating season, breeding wolves become very affectionate with one another in anticipation of the female's ovulation cycle. The pack tension rises as each mature wolf feels urged to mate  . During this time, in fact, the alpha male and alpha female may be forced to prevent other wolves from mating with one another .     Under normal circumstances, a pack can only support one litter per year, so this dominance behavior is beneficial in the long run, Context: After the alpha pair, there may also, especially in larger packs, be a beta wolf or wolves, a ""second-in-command"" to the alphas  . Betas typically assume a more prominent role in assisting with the upbringing of the alpha pair's litter, often serving as surrogate mothers or fathers while the alpha pair is away  . Beta wolves are the most likely to challenge their superiors for the role of the alpha, though some betas seem content with being second, and will sometimes even let lower ranking wolves leapfrog them for the position of alpha should circumstances necessitate such a happening, such as the death of the alpha . More ambitious beta wolves, however, will only wait so long before contending for alpha position unless they choose to disperse and create their own pack instead","1039, 1083",A pack can only suppport one littler per year,
