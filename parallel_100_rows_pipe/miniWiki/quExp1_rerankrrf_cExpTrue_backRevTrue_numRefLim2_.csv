Which defense mechanism uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies?,"Mimicry. It involves using colour or shape to deceive potential enemies, such as some longhorn beetles resembling wasps to fool predators into keeping their distance."," Context: Another defence that often uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry  . A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to wasps, which fools predators into keeping their distance even though the beetles are in fact harmless  . This defence can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their colour mimicry with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble.  ,  Context: Camouflage involves the use of colouration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment  . Among those that exhibit this defensive strategy are some of the leaf beetles (family Chysomelidae), having green colouring very similar to their habitat on plant leaves . More complex camouflage also occurs, as with some weevils, where various coloured scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung.  ","2409, 2408",mimicry,
Which type of beetle is a pest of potato plants?,The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is a notorious pest of potato plants.," Context: * The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a notorious pest of potato plants. Crops are destroyed and the beetle can only be treated by employing expensive pesticides, many of which it has begun to develop resistance to  . As well as potatoes, suitable hosts can be a number of plants from the potato family (Solanaceae), such as nightshade, tomato, aubergine and capsicum.  ,  Context:  Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways . They often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are prey of various animals including birds and mammals . Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the boll weevil Anthonomus grandis, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, and the mungbean or cowpea beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests  ","2426, 2378",Colorado potato beetle,
How can beetle larvae be differentiated from other insect larvae?,"Beetle larvae can be differentiated by their varied appearance, particularly between beetle families. They can be campodeiform (flattened and highly mobile), elateriform (resembling hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs), or scarab"," Context: . Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families  . Beetles whose larvae are somewhat flattened and are highly mobile are the ground beetles, some rove beetles, and others; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs  . These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms . Beetles in the families of the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, but more commonly known as grubs.  ,  Context: The larva is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle life cycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources  . Examples of internal feeders are most Buprestidae and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles) .

What do beetles eat?,"Beetles eat a variety of food sources including dung, dead animals, plants, other arthropods, earthworms, snails, and even other insects' larvae.

Some are generalists, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialised in their diet  . Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host specific, feeding on only a single species of plant . Ground beetles and rove beetles (family Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and will catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey such as earthworms and snails . While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.  ,  Context: Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species  . This can range from dung, which is consumed by coprophagous species such as certain scarab beetles (family Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species such as the carrion beetles (family Silphidae)  . Some of the beetles found within dung and carrion are in fact predatory, such as the clown beetles, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects.

What are the similarities between beetles and grasshoppers?,Beetles and grasshoppers have similar mouthparts.," Context: Beetles have mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the mandibles, which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles  . The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below)  . Two pairs of finger-like appendages are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. These are the maxillary and labial palpi.  ,  Context: Another defence that often uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry  .

Is a beetle's general anatomy uniform?,"Yes, a beetle's general anatomy is quite uniform."," Context: The general anatomy of beetles is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order  . Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise . The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax . When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle ""section"" is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings  ,  Context:  Beetles are generally characterised by a particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra). The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites, separated by thin sutures . This design creates the armoured defences of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. The elytra are not used for flight, but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings (alae) . The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and are stored below the elytra.  ","2383, 2384",Yes,

They can also spend much of their lives on dry land  . Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections . These projections, called ""papillae"", have a rich blood supply, and serve to increase the surface area of the cloaca.
