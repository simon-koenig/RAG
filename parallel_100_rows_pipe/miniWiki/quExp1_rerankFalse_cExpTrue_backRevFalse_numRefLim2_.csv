The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths . At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them upâfirst principles, therefore, cannot be reached . Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.  ","738, 226",1821,

A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to wasps, which fools predators into keeping their distance even though the beetles are in fact harmless . This defence can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their colour mimicry with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble.  ,  Context:  Camouflage involves the use of colouration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment . Among those that exhibit this defensive strategy are some of the leaf beetles (family Chysomelidae), having green colouring very similar to their habitat on plant leaves .

What are the similarities between beetles and grasshoppers?,Beetles have mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers.," Context: Beetles have mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the mandibles, which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles  . The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below) . Two pairs of finger-like appendages are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. These are the maxillary and labial palpi.  ,  Context: Another defence that often uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry  . A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to wasps, which fools predators into keeping their distance even though the beetles are in fact harmless  . This defence can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their colour mimicry with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble.  ","2386, 2409",mouthparts,

Is a beetle's general anatomy uniform?,"Yes, a beetle's general anatomy is quite uniform."," Context: The general anatomy of beetles is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order  . Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise . The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax . When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle ""section"" is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings  ,  Context:  Beetles are generally characterised by a particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra). The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites, separated by thin sutures . This design creates the armoured defences of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. The elytra are not used for flight, but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings (alae) . The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and are stored below the elytra.  ","2383, 2384",Yes,

What was given by Aristotle for the hardened shield like forewings?,"The name ""Coleoptera""."," Context:  The name ""Coleoptera"" was given by Aristotle for the hardened shield like forewings (coleo = shield + ptera = wing).  ,  Context: . Having replicated an experiment which involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube  . At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and this substance was forever in motion  . Furthermore, ""Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,"" Aristotle declared. Aristotle,Physics,VII,1.

Oxygen is what?,"Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system in some organisms, while others breathe air and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs."," Context:  Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibres. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system.  ,  Context:  Even though many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air, and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. They can also spend much of their lives on dry land . Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections . These projections, called ""papillae"", have a rich blood supply, and serve to increase the surface area of the cloaca.
