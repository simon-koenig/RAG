A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae.

Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","19948482, 24462468, 22279046, 23809990, 24634216, 24879017, 24532715, 22850673, 22850674, 24685139, 24656819, 15342490"

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

Previous work suggests  regulatory roles for Tail and CKM, but an integrated model for these activities ","21948239, 24998386, 24998386, 31209209, 31209209, 27773677","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.","29209056, 26240385, 24824069, 27773677, 28575439, 27742736, 24998386, 33176147, 31209209, 31211995, 29157917"
Is colistin an antibiotic?,"No, it is uncertain whether colistin is an antibiotic based on the given information. However, it is mentioned that chloramphenicol was used in combination with colistin against ESKAPE pathogens, suggesting a potential antimicrobial use for col"," Context: possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity. ,  Context: possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity. ,  Context: the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the ,  Context: in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was ,  Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in ,  Context: ulcerative colitis.
