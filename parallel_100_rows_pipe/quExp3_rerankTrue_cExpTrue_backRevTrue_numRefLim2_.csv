What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that STAG3, a germinal cell-specific cohesin complex subunit, is involved in meiosis and"," Context: STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are  found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member,  STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.  ,  Context: alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.  We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers with inactivating alterations of STAG2.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"There is no mention of glioblastoma in the provided context. The context only discusses the association between cell phone use and neuroma, meningioma, and glioma, but not specifically glioblastoma."," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer.  RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a disorder where inflammation occurs in different parts of the body, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19."," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are MEC-17 (acetyltransferase), SIRT2 (deacetylase), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase and also functions as a tubulin de"," Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ","12024216, 23126280","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214"

In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients.

Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 inhibits activation of prereplication complexes (pre-RCs) through two N-terminal motifs, RVxF and SILK, which recruit PP1 phosphatase (Glc7). This interaction prevents Dbf4-dependent kinase (DD"," Context: Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.  ,  Context:  The Rif1 protein, originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast,  has recently been implicated in DNA replication control from yeast to metazoans.  Here, we show that budding yeast Rif1 protein inhibits activation of prereplication complexes (pre-RCs). This inhibitory function requires two  N-terminal motifs, RVxF and SILK, associated with recruitment of PP1 phosphatase  (Glc7). In G1 phase, we show both that Glc7 interacts with Rif1 in an RVxF/SILK-dependent manner and that two proteins implicated in pre-RC  activation, Mcm4 and Sld3, display increased Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)  phosphorylation in rif1 mutants. Rif1 also interacts with Dbf4 in yeast  ","23809990, 24685139","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","19948482, 24462468, 22279046, 23809990, 24634216, 24879017, 24532715, 22850673, 22850674, 24685139, 24656819, 15342490"

Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal  angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in  pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Mutational biases between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs are introduced due to directional mutation pressure.," Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is a paralog of UPC2 in yeast.," Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases due to its modifying effects on the immune system."," Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in Caenorhabditis elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator contributes to genome organization at different scales, affecting transcription, DNA replication, and locus rearrangement, together with architectural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin."," Context: Cohesin is a large ring-shaped protein complex, conserved from yeast to human,  which participates in most DNA transactions that take place in the nucleus. It  mediates sister chromatid cohesion, which is essential for chromosome  segregation and homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. Together with  architectural proteins and transcriptional regulators, such as CTCF and  Mediator, respectively, it contributes to genome organization at different scales and thereby affects transcription, DNA replication, and locus  rearrangement. Although cohesin is essential for cell viability, partial loss of  function can affect these processes differently in distinct cell types. Mutations in genes encoding cohesin subunits and regulators of the complex have  been identified in several cancers. Understanding the functional significance of  these alterations may have relevant implications for patient classification,  ,  Context: had a strongly synergistic effect, consistent with both molecules acting in a  common pathway. In addition, three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization  revealed that Nipbl and Med12 are required to bring regions containing  long-range enhancers into close proximity with the zebrafish hoxda cluster.
