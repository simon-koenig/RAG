What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Defective control of the histone code contributes to the development of this tumor type. Restoration of expression of"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ,  Context:  Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum.

The recent studies reach very  different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone  studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the  Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the  ,  Context: radiological images.

The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score is a screening tool for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).," Context: developed and validated in population-based studies. AIM: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score for the screening of SDB  patients from a sleep clinic in China, and to compare the predictive value of  the NoSAS score with the STOP-Bang questionnaire. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients from a sleep clinic who had undergone  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) testing by type III portable monitor device at the  hospital and completed the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score was assessed  by reviewing medical records. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive  value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different  AHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening. RESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were diagnosed with SDB. When predicting overall (AHI ≥ 5), moderate-to-severe  (AHI ≥ 15), and severe (AHI ≥ 30) SDB, the sensitivity and specificity of the  NoSAS score were 71.2, 80.4, and 83.1% and 62.4, 49.3, and 40.7%, respectively.  ,  Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography.

The circRNAs are also highly enriched in the brain and  increase continuously from the embryonic to the adult stage. Although the  functional significance and mechanism of action of circRNAs are still being  actively explored, they are thought to regulate the transcription of their host  genes and sequestration of miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Some circRNAs are  also shown to have translation potential to form peptides. The expression and  abundance of circRNAs seem to be spatiotemporally maintained in a normal brain.  Altered expression of circRNAs is also thought to mediate several disorders, including brain-tumor growth, and acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders  by affecting mechanisms such as angiogenesis, neuronal plasticity, autophagy,  apoptosis, and inflammation. This review discusses the involvement of various circRNAs in brain development and CNS diseases. A better understanding of the  circRNA function will help to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat CNS  complications.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are widespread in  the eukaryotic genome. Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important  roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. However,  whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although  translation of several circRNAs was recently reported.

Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma that usually occurs in 1-2% of patients with severe coagulative disorder. It typically develops in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and sub"," Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma  usually seen in 1-2% patients with severe coagulative disorder (James et al.,  2003). It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region. We report a rare case occurring in  the mandible of a 14-year-old boy who presented with considerable expansion and displacement of teeth.  ,  Context:  The haemophilic pseudotumor is defined as an encased hematoma that increases of  volume progressively by episodes of recurrent hemorrhage. It is a rare  complication of haemophilia occurring in 1-2% of patients with moderate or severe factor VIII or IX deficiency. Its more frequent location is in the long  bones of low extremities and pelvis. We report a case of a 21-year-old man with  moderate deficiency of factor VIII (19% of normal factor VIII activity) that developed a pseudotumor in the cranium. To our knowledge, this is the third case  of the cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in medical literature.  ,  Context: INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum.  CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial  hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature.  ,  Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context:  Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief.

The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components.

TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A high TAM infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments.

In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant  leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a  protective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an immune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to  allow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional  therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit cancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also  responsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint  inhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to  ","29594035, 29594035, 32708142, 34276698, 34276698, 33050070",Therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional therapies has yielded promising results.,29594035

In this chapter, we present the application of widely used  bioinformatic methodologies to assess, trim, and filter RNA-seq reads for  quality using FastQC and Trim Galore, respectively. High-quality reads are  mapped using Bowtie2 and differentially expressed genes across different groups  were estimated using the DEseq2 R-Bioconductor package. In addition, we describe  the various steps to perform the sample-wise data quality assessment by  generating exploratory plots through the DESeq2 package. Simple steps to calculate the significant differentially expressed genes, up- and down-regulated  genes, and exporting the data and images are also included. A Venn diagram is a  useful method to compare the differentially expressed genes across various comparisons and steps to generate the Venn diagram from DESeq2 results are  provided. Finally, the output from DESeq2 is compared to published results from  EdgeR.

Our laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B promoter region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription.  By further investigating the regulation of the Gfi-1B promoter, here we report  that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negatively regulated by its own gene product, (ii) GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites in the  Gfi-1B promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses GATA-1-mediated stimulation of  Gfi-1B promoter through their protein interaction.

The combination of these approaches revealed  the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple  Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs.

TPMCalculator is a one-step software to process RNA-seq alignments in BAM format and reports TPM  values, raw read counts and feature lengths for genes, transcripts, exons and  introns. The program describes the genomic features through a model generated from the gene transfer format file used during alignments reporting of the TPM  values and the raw read counts for each feature. In this paper, we show the  correlation for 1256 samples from the TCGA-BRCA project between TPM and FPKM  ,  Context: taking experimental distributions of fragment size into consideration.  Quantitative RT-PCR based on 27 randomly selected genes in two human cell lines  and computer simulation experiments demonstrated superior accuracy of NEUMA over  other recently developed methods. NEUMA covers a large proportion of genes and  mRNA isoforms and offers a measure of consistency ('consistency coefficient')  for each gene between an independently measured gene-wise level and the sum of  the isoform levels. NEUMA is applicable to both paired-end and single-end  RNA-Seq data. We propose that NEUMA could make a standard method in quantifying  gene transcript levels from RNA-Seq data.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are  measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and  whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.

However,"," Context: Accumulating data suggest a link between alterations/deficiencies in  cytoskeletal proteins and the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure,  although the molecular basis for this link remains unclear. Cypher/ZASP is a  cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its  encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of  the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To explore the role of Cypher in myocardium and to better  understand molecular mechanisms by which mutations in cypher cause  cardiomyopathy, we utilized a conditional approach to knockout Cypher, specially in either developing or adult myocardium. Cardiac-specific Cypher knockout (CKO)  mice developed a severe form of DCM with disrupted cardiomyocyte ultrastructure  and decreased cardiac function, which eventually led to death before 23 weeks of  ,  Context:  AIMS: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is caused by mutations in multiple  genes. It is still unclear whether LVNC is the primary determinant of  cardiomyopathy or rather a secondary phenomenon with intrinsic cardiomyocyte dysfunction being the actual cause of the disease. Here, we describe a family  with LVNC due to a novel missense mutation, pE96K, in the cardiac troponin T  gene (TNNT2). METHODS AND RESULTS: The novel mutation was identified in the index patient and all affected relatives, but not in 430 healthy control individuals. Mutations in  known LVNC-associated genes were excluded. To investigate the pathophysiological  implications of the mutation, we generated transgenic mice expressing human  ,  Context:  Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a rare, morphologically distinct  primary genetic cardiomyopathy, which was first described in children, but is  becoming increasingly recognised in adults. The most common clinical manifestations include heart failure, arrhythmias and embolic events, and in  children it may be associated with facial dysmorphisms and Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome. Misdiagnosis may occur through lack of awareness of the condition, but with increased vigilance detailed cardiac imaging can reliably differentiate  isolated left ventricular non-compaction from other pathological causes of left  ventricular dysfunction. This is important because the condition may be  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the presentation, diagnosis and management of  isolated left ventricular non-compaction in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with progressive symptoms of heart failure.  CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are important as treatment and prognosis may differ significantly. Our current  understanding of isolated left ventricular non-compaction, including diagnostic  criteria, management and prognosis, is discussed.  ,  Context:  Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare congenital  cardiomyopathy that affects both children and adults. Since the clinical  manifestations are not sufficient to establish diagnosis, echocardiography is the diagnostic tool that makes it possible to document ventricular  non-compaction and establish prognostic factors. We report a 47-year-old woman  with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with unknown etiology. Echocardiography showed mild left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction (EF =  20-25%).

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by counteracting DDK-mediated phosphorylation through its interaction with PP1, a protein phosphatase.

Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in  regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","19948482, 24462468, 22279046, 23809990, 24634216, 24879017, 24532715, 22850673, 22850674, 24685139, 24656819, 15342490"

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein contains well-conserved domains at its N- and C-termini, and a poorly conserved central region that includes the GP, CcN, and SP domains."," Context:  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila corepressor required by numerous DNA-binding  repressors, many of which are distributed in gradients and provide positional  information during development. Gro contains well-conserved domains at its N- and C-termini, and a poorly conserved central region that includes the GP, CcN,  and SP domains. All lethal point mutations in gro map to the conserved regions,  leading to speculation that the unconserved central domains are dispensable. However, our sequence analysis suggests that the central domains are disordered  leading us to suspect that the lack of lethal mutations in this region reflects  a lack of order rather than an absence of essential functions. In support of  ,  Context:  The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata. The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins.  ,  Context: Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences  results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling  pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho family members is correlated with several neoplastic conditions. Here we focus  on the functions of Groucho proteins during body patterning and their  implication in tumorigenesis.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation.

Although a repressor could function by recruiting just a single  co-repressor, many can recruit more than one, with Drosophila Brinker (Brk)  recruiting the co-repressors CtBP and Groucho (Gro), in addition to possessing a  third repression domain, 3R. Previous studies indicated that Gro is sufficient for Brk to repress targets in the wing, questioning why it should need to  recruit CtBP, a short-range co-repressor, when Gro is known to be able to  function over longer distances. To resolve this we have used genomic engineering to generate a series of brk mutants that are unable to recruit Gro, CtBP and/or  have 3R deleted. These reveal that although the recruitment of Gro is necessary  and can be sufficient for Brk to make an almost morphologically wild-type fly,  ","22319573, 17624551, 17643306, 8955148, 8955148, 24086079",Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding proteins.

Hypophosphatemia, defined as serum phosphate levels below 2.5 mg/dL  (0.81 mmol/L), is frequently observed in the course of treatment with commonly  used drugs, such as diuretics, bisphosphonates, antibiotics, insulin, and  antacids. Furthermore, this undesired effect may complicate the use of several  novel medications, including teriparatide, denosumab, parenteral iron, and  antiviral and antineoplastic agents.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avandamet or uptitrated metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes  inadequately controlled with metformin alone. METHODS: This study was a 48-week, multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, active-controlled trial. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated  hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5%) receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg)  were recruited from 21 centers in China (from 19 November, 2009 to 15 March,  ,  Context: acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia.

U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases.

To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide  receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However, a few years ago a synthetic high-affinity agonist  [dTyr(6),betaAla(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]Bn-(6-14) was described but was  nonselective for BRS-3 over other Bn receptors. Based on this peptide, in  ,  Context: Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides,  has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC),  and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we  demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides,  neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung  carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined.

By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,There is no mention of PCDHGC4 in the provided context.," Context: c.2047C>T (p.Arg683Cys), and the second individual was homozygous for c.2980A>C  (p.Lys994Gln). Skin fibroblasts from the first individual confirmed the variants  as loss of function and showed significant decreases in total GDP-[3H] fucose  and [3H] fucose-1-phosphate. There was also a decrease in the incorporation of  [5,6-3H]-fucose into fucosylated glycoproteins. Lys994 has previously been shown  to be an important site for ubiquitin conjugation. Here, we show that  loss-of-function variants in FUK cause a congenital glycosylation disorder  characterized by a defective fucose-salvage pathway.  ,  Context: involving crosslinked DNA at stalled replication forks. Depletion of SLX4, which  interacts with multiple nucleases and has been recently identified as a Holliday  junction resolvase, results in increased sensitivity of the cells to DNA  crosslinking agents. Here we report the identification of biallelic SLX4  mutations in two individuals with typical clinical features of Fanconi anemia  and show that the cellular defects in these individuals' cells are complemented  by wildtype SLX4, demonstrating that biallelic mutations in SLX4 (renamed here  as FANCP) cause a new subtype of Fanconi anemia, Fanconi anemia-P.  ,  Context: The OTOF gene encodes otoferlin, a critical protein at the synapse of auditory  sensory cells, the inner hair cells (IHCs). In the absence of otoferlin, signal  transmission of IHCs fails due to impaired release of synaptic vesicles at the  IHC synapse. Biallelic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in OTOF  predominantly cause autosomal recessive profound prelingual deafness, DFNB9. Due  to the isolated defect of synaptic transmission and initially preserved otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), the clinical characteristics have been termed  ""auditory synaptopathy"". We review the broad phenotypic spectrum reported in  patients with variants in OTOF that includes milder hearing loss, as well as progressive and temperature-sensitive hearing loss. We highlight several  challenges that must be addressed for rapid clinical and genetic diagnosis.  Importantly, we call for changes in newborn hearing screening protocols, since  ,  Context:  Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of  severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and  Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients  with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can  reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR). We  studied the INSR gene in five subjects with congenital SIR and in a patient with  type A SIR. Nine biallelic INSR gene mutations (eight novels, including an  ,  Context: dominant mutations induce a gain-of-function effect on the channel. Here, we  report a consanguineous family with three siblings who showed short stature,  scoliosis, gross motor impairment, and a progressive form of contractures  involving the distal joints that is distinct from that found in patients with  dominant mutations in PIEZO2. These siblings also displayed deficits in  proprioception and touch sensation. Whole-exome sequencing performed in the  three affected siblings revealed the presence of a rare homozygous variant  (c.2708C>G; p.S903*) in PIEZO2. This variant is predicted to disrupt PIEZO2  function by abolishing the pore domain. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three siblings are homozygous whereas their parents and an unaffected sibling  are heterozygous for this variant. Recessive mutations in PIEZO2 thus appear to  cause a progressive phenotype that overlaps with, while being mostly distinct from that associated with dominant mutations in the same gene.  ,  Context: Survival of the malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical  Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is dependent on constitutive activation of the nuclear  factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD  is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and known to function as a tumor  suppressor. To determine whether CYLD mutations play a role in cHL pathogenesis,  we sequenced the gene in cHL cell lines and microdissected HRS cells obtained  from lymph-node biopsies. A biallelic inactivation by mutations was found in the  cHL cell-line KM-H2. However, the other seven cHL cell lines analyzed and HRS  cells of 10 primary cHL cases did not show any mutations. By interphase cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase  cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating  decreased CYLD copy numbers were observed in a total of 10 of 29 primary cases. Our results suggest that biallelic CYLD mutations are rarely involved in cHL  pathogenesis. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that KM-H2 cells, besides the CYLD  mutations, also carry inactivating mutations in the genes of two other NF-kappaB  ","30503518, 21240275, 33256196, 23824322, 27607563, 20607853","Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with progressive microcephaly, seizures, and joint anomalies.",34244665

It is taken up by FR," Context: diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets  FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout  treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response.

Furthermore, the recent  ,  Context: RESULTS: Our index patient had a neurologic illness defined initially by ataxia  and dysarthria, which fluctuated in relation to each subsequent infliximab  infusion and, after 6 months, culminated in areflexic flaccid quadriplegia. In  addition, 15 patients in whom Guillain-Barré syndrome developed following  TNFalpha antagonist therapy were identified from the FDA database.  Guillain-Barré syndrome developed following infliximab therapy in 9 patients,  following etanercept therapy in 5 patients, and following adalimumab therapy in  1 patient. Among the 13 patients for whom followup data were available, 1  patient experienced no resolution, 9 patients had partial resolution, and 3 patients had complete resolution of Guillain-Barré syndrome following therapy. CONCLUSION: An association of Guillain-Barré syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist  therapy is supported by the worsening of neurologic symptoms that occurred in our index patient following each infusion of infliximab, and by the temporal  association of this syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist therapy in 15 other  patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative.

A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a paralog of UPC2 in yeast, as it shares high homology with Upc2p, particularly at the carboxy terminus where 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two proteins"," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,No information is available in the given context about epistaxis or dental implant placement.," Context: however, was localized in several microfoci prior to being reorganized into  fewer larger foci. Prior to chromatin condensation, coilin redistributed to the  nucleolar compartment and was absent from nuclei where chromatin had begun to  condense. Such nuclei were positive by TUNEL staining. In contrast to the  nucleus, mitochondrial degradation in lens fibre cells was a rapid process and  involved a relatively sharp transition between positive and negative fibre cells  for two mitochondrial specific markers, BAP 37 and prohibitin. A link between  the changes in the nuclear lamina and chromatin with the initiation of  mitochondrial fragmentation was also observed. Therefore, it is possible that the signal for the initiation of denucleation could originate from the  mitochondria as proposed for apoptosis. Differences between apoptosis and lens  fibre cell denucleation were noted and included the timescale of nuclear changes as well as the persistence of a nuclear remnant. These studies suggest that  transcriptional shutdown precedes lamina reorganization and chromatin breakdown  during lens fibre cell denucleation.  ,  Context: high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk =  25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). Among the 21 malformed  infants we found a characteristic pattern of malformation involving  craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures. The  malformations included microtia/anotia (15 infants), micrognathia (6), cleft  palate (3), conotruncal heart defects and aortic-arch abnormalities (8), thymic  defects (7), retinal or optic-nerve abnormalities (4), and central nervous  system malformations (18). The pattern of malformation closely resembled that  produced in animal studies of retinoid teratogenesis. It is possible that a major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on  cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial,  cardiac, and thymic malformations.  ,  Context: Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National  Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. A number of  randomised controlled trials are under way to establish the place of routine  screening of asymptomatic men. We report the possible practice of prostate  cancer screening with reference to the appropriate age range for screening, how  to screen for prostate cancer and how often, and what constitutes an abnormal result that would merit referral to a urologist for a prostate biopsy.  ,  Context: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset disease but with an  increasingly recognized preclinical prodrome. A wide spectrum of investigative  approaches has identified loss of inhibitory function at the heart of ALS. In  developing an explanation for the onset of ALS, it remains a consideration that  ALS has its origins in neonatal derangement of the γ-aminobutyric acid  (GABA)-ergic system, with delayed conversion from excitatory to mature  inhibitory GABA and impaired excitation/inhibition balance. If this is so, the  resulting chronic excitotoxicity could marginalize cortical network functioning  very early in life, laying the path for neurodegeneration. The possibility that adult-onset neurodegenerative conditions might have their roots in early  developmental derangements is worthy of consideration, particularly in relation  to current models of disease pathogenesis. Unraveling the very early molecular events will be crucial in developing a better understanding of ALS and other  adult neurodegenerative disorders. Muscle Nerve, 2019.  ,  Context: Moreover, the diverse impacts of autophagy on a variety of signaling pathways in  HCV-infected cells suggest that the autophagic process is required for balancing  HCV-host cell interactions and involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver  diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying how HCV activates  autophagy to benefit viral growth is still enigmatic. Additionally, how the  autophagic response contributes to disease progression in HCV-infected cells  remains largely unknown. Hence, in this review, we overview the interplay  between autophagy and the HCV life cycle and propose possible mechanisms by  which autophagy may promote the pathogenesis of HCV-associated chronic liver diseases. Moreover, we outline the related studies on how autophagy interplays  with HCV replication and discuss the possible implications of autophagy and  viral replication in the progression of HCV-induced liver diseases, e.g., steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, we explore the potential  therapeutics that target autophagy to cure HCV infection and its related liver  diseases.  ,  Context: respectively. Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to  reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to  block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to  increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum  and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically  to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs  previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA  cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this  regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine. Possible mechanisms of action of molindone are discussed based on these findings.

The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.

CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated  in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH  antagonist. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and  maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in  103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and  neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.  INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms  scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and  ,  Context: months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels  within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action.

Describe OligoSTORM,Olaratumab (LY3012207/IMC-3G3) is a human mAb that exclusively binds to PDGFRα.," Context:  The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a conserved large  hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, crucial  for the maintenance of cristae morphology. MINOS has been suggested to represent the core of an extended protein network that controls mitochondrial function and  structure, and has been linked to several human diseases. The spatial  arrangement of MINOS within mitochondria is ill-defined, however. Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and immunogold  electron microscopy, we determined the distribution of three known human MINOS  subunits (mitofilin, MINOS1, and CHCHD3) in mammalian cells.

Furthermore,  ,  Context: Infantile Blount's disease is a condition that causes genu varum and internal  tibial torsion. Treatment options include observation, orthotics, corrective  osteotomy, elevation of the medial tibial plateau, resection of a physeal bar,  lateral hemi-epiphysiodesis, and guided growth of the proximal tibial physis.  Each of these treatment options has its disadvantages. Treating the coronal  deformity alone (genu varum) will result in persistence of the internal tibial  torsion (the axial deformity). In this report, we describe the combination of  lateral growth modulation and distal tibial external rotation osteotomy to  correct all the elements of the disease. This has not been described before for treatment of Blount's disease. Both coronal and axial deformities were corrected  in this patient. We propose this combination (rather than the lateral growth  modulation alone) as the method of treatment for early stages of Blount's disease as it corrects both elements of the disease and in the same time avoids  the complications of proximal tibial osteotomy.  ,  Context:  Developmental and Epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) describe heterogeneous  epilepsy syndromes, characterized by early-onset, refractory seizures and  developmental delay (DD).

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6," Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: The use of medicinal plants concomitantly with conventional drugs can result in  herb-drug interactions that cause fluctuations in drug bioavailability and  consequent therapeutic failure and/or toxic effects.

However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype.

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is a muscle-specific protein found in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles of vertebrates, but it is not mentioned to be present in plants."," Context:  Inherited mutations in the gene coding for the intermediate filament protein  desmin have been demonstrated to cause severe skeletal and cardiac myopathies.  Unexpectedly, some of the mutated desmins, in particular those carrying single amino acid alterations in the non-alpha-helical carboxy-terminal domain  (""tail""), have been demonstrated to form apparently normal filaments both in  vitro and in transfected cells. Thus, it is not clear if filament properties are affected by these mutations at all. For this reason, we performed oscillatory  shear experiments with six different desmin ""tail"" mutants in order to  characterize the mesh size of filament networks and their strain stiffening  ,  Context: but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average  diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and  average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis  indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly,  but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated  that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all  are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.  ,  Context: but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average  diameter of 10 nm.

The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are two of  the leading causes of respiratory infections in children and elderly and  immunocompromised patients worldwide. There is no approved treatment for HMPV  and only one prophylactic treatment against RSV, palivizumab, for high-risk  infants. Better understanding of the viral lifecycles in a more relevant model  system may help identify novel therapeutic targets. By utilizing three-dimensional (3-D) human airway tissues to examine viral infection in a  physiologically relevant model system, we showed that RSV infects and spreads  more efficiently than HMPV, with the latter requiring higher multiplicities of infection (MOIs) to yield similar levels of infection. Apical ciliated cells  were the target for both viruses, but RSV apical release was significantly more  efficient than HMPV. In RSV- or HMPV-infected cells, cytosolic inclusion bodies  ,  Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM.

RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue,  liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological  role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the  deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1  and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In  liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1 protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under  basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As  lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This  ","32759319, 28407038, 28407038, 28407038, 28407038, 22908270",emMAW,28407038

However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2"," Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have been found to reduce mitochondrial O2 consumption and increase H2O2 release in rat liver mitochondria, which could be related to their effects on energy metabolism. However, there is no explicit information about direct effects of thyron"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context:  Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to  those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature. Since the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines).

In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation.

Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

We  attempted to determine the expression patterns for a random sample of the annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: times--three cases of clinical diphtheria due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae  biovar. mitis and two cases of tonsillitis/pharyngitis due to Corynebacterium  ulcerans. The source of the infection was not identified in any of the cases.  The first case of diphtheria in 1968 was imported from abroad. The following two  cases in 1983 and 1985 were due to strains of the same phage type and peptide  profile as the strains isolated during the epidemic in Sweden in 1984-1986. This  indicates that the Danish cases and the Swedish epidemic derived from the same  source. The diphtheria immunity of the Danish population is decreasing, and the  level of protection is approaching the Swedish level. The impact is that a situation like that in Sweden may be anticipated with diphtheria epidemic in the  lowest socio-economical groups--the skid row dwellers, alcoholics and drug  abusers--if the immunization program against diphtheria is not intensified.  ,  Context: excess to cause haemochromatosis. As excess free iron can cause oxidative  damage, it is important that the levels of iron in the body are tightly  regulated which appears to be done only by digestive absorption, as there is no  known regulating mechanism for elimination of iron. The amount of free iron is  also kept to a minimum thanks to binding to transferrin for transport, and to  ferritin for storage. Recent research has put emphasis on the possible role of  excess iron in the brain in several degenerative diseases. Iron deficiency in  the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive  deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd  ,  Context: records. The risk of SMN was evaluated by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)  and excess absolute risk. Poisson multiple regression models were used to assess  the impact of host and therapy factors on the risk of developing SMNS: All  statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: In 298 individuals, 314 SMNs were identified (SIR = 6.38; 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 5.69 to 7.13). The largest observed excess SMNs were  bone and breast cancers (SIR = 19.14 [95% CI = 12.72 to 27.67] and SIR = 16.18  [95% CI = 12.35 to 20.83], respectively). A statistically significant excess of  SMNs followed all childhood cancers. In multivariate regression models adjusted for therapeutic radiation exposure, SMNs of any type were independently  associated with female sex (P<.001), childhood cancer at a younger age (P for  trend <.001), childhood Hodgkin's disease or soft-tissue sarcoma (P<.001 and P =.01, respectively), and exposure to alkylating agents (P for trend =.02).  Twenty years after the childhood cancer diagnosis, the cumulative estimated SMN  incidence was 3.2%.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context: cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies using  isolated dissociated cultures indicate that neural cells express S1P receptors  and respond to receptor engagement. Our objective was to assess the effects of  fingolimod on myelin-related processes within a multicellular environment that  maintains physiological cell-cell interactions, using organotypic cerebellar  slice cultures. Fingolimod treatment had no impact on myelin under basal  conditions. Fingolimod treatment subsequent to lysolecithin-induced  demyelination enhanced remyelination and process extension by OPCs and mature  oligodendrocytes, while increasing microglia numbers and immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The number of  phagocytosing microglia was not increased by fingolimod. Using S1P receptor  specific agonists and antagonists, we determined that fingolimod-induced effects on remyelination and astrogliosis were mediated primarily through S1P3 and S1P5,  whereas enhanced microgliosis was mediated through S1P1 and S1P5.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a key role in transferring signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. It occupies Pol II promoters and interacts with other complexes such as RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF"," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked.

By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked.

We  have combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator  from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator  occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically  with Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between  Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin.  These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly, mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been  shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we  have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies  ,  Context: Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 form the core of a transcription factor network that  maintains embryonic stem cells in the pluripotent state in both humans and mice.  These critical factors have been implicated as both positive and negative  regulators of transcription, varying by promoter and differentiation state of  the cell. The Mediator complex, a ubiquitous conserved complex of approximately  30 subunits, facilitates transcription by coordinating RNA polymerase II binding to target promoters via gene-specific activators and can be divided into several  functional subcomplexes. Med12 is part of a subcomplex of four proteins  associated with the core Mediator complex and has been found to function both in repressing and activating transcription when recruited to target promoters. We  identified an interaction between Med12 and Nanog and present evidence of  involvement of Med12 in regulation of Nanog function.
