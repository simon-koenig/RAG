What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,I don't know the answer. The provided context does not mention medulloblastoma or histone lysine methylation. It only discusses DNMT3B and its effects on cancer cells.,"Context: reduction of DNMT3B protein levels induces antiproliferative effects in cancer  cells that were attributed to the demethylation and reactivation of tumor  suppressor genes. However, methylation changes have not been analyzed in detail  yet. Using RNA interference we reduced DNMT3B protein levels in colon cancer  cell lines. Our results confirm that depletion of DNMT3B specifically reduced  the proliferation rate of DNMT3B-overexpressing colon cancer cell lines.  However, genome-scale DNA methylation profiling failed to reveal methylation  changes at putative DNMT3B target genes, even in the complete absence of DNMT3B.  These results show that DNMT3B is dispensable for the maintenance of aberrant DNA methylation patterns in human colon cancer cells and they have important  implications for the development of targeted DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as  epigenetic cancer drugs",22563479,"Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

Describe RIblast,RIblast is a search method that uses PSI-BLAST with a low-complexity segment filtration procedure removed. This modification aims to improve its overall search quality by eliminating potential noise in the results.,"Context: performance of different search methods. RESULTS: Experiments are performed based on the SCOP database. Popular sequence  comparison algorithms, namely Smith-Waterman (SSEARCH), FASTA, BLAST and  PSI-BLAST are evaluated. We find that (1) the low-complexity segment filtration  procedure in BLAST actually harms its overall search quality; (2) AP scores of  different search methods are approximately in proportion of the logarithm of  search time; and (3) homologs in protein families with many members tend to be  more obscure than those in small families. This measure may be helpful for  developing new search algorithms and can guide researchers in selecting most suitable search methods. AVAILABILITY: Test sets and source code of this evaluation tool are available  upon request",14668231,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942
Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,The context does not provide information about visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes. I don't know the answer.,"Context: Many debilitating diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, involve  apoptosis. Several methods have been developed for visualizing apoptotic cells  in vitro or in fixed tissues, but few tools are available for visualizing  apoptotic cells in live animals. Here we describe a genetically encoded  fluorescent reporter protein that labels apoptotic cells in live zebrafish  embryos. During apoptosis, the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed  on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The calcium-dependent protein  Annexin V (A5) binds PS with high affinity, and biochemically purified,  fluorescently labeled A5 probes have been widely used to detect apoptosis in vitro. Here we show that secreted A5 fused to yellow fluorescent protein  specifically labels apoptotic cells in living zebrafish. We use this fluorescent  probe to characterize patterns of apoptosis in living zebrafish larvae and to visualize neuronal cell death at single-cell resolution in vivo",20601526,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. Coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform, this technology could be extended to any organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. The method gives researchers precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging of chromosomal regions. It is anticipated that this technology will lead to an enhanced ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes.","24510436, 23236188"
Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,H4 Lys 20 methylation.,"Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted",12208845,Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase. Upregulation of PR-Set7 expression upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding, affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels, which in turn regulates fetal hemoglobin.","Context: Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin  (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics. Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding,  affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"No.  The context mentions BCG vaccine as the main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), but does not mention avelumab.","Context: Intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the  main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with proven  effects on reducing recurrence, progression, and death from NMIBC. However, it  is not effective in all patients, and recurrence after adequate BCG therapy can  frequently lead to progression to more life-threatening disease. This  point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient  with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease,  that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of  induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full  course of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not  likely to work; this meets the new definition of a ""BCG unresponsive"" disease.

The potential of micro RNA (miRNA) modulation for the  de-repression of survival and pro-angiogenic genes is discussed. Since gene  therapy of the target region is preferable to avoid systemic contamination,  application routes are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: miRNAs are a promising new development for successful gene  therapy, especially for acute myocardial infarction since their miRNA  antagonists are easy to apply and appear to be selectively absorbed by the  ischemic myocardial tissue. Rapid uptake and prolonged presence of known  antimirs and antagomirs support this notion.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints  in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 (refs 4-8). Here we report that  all these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the  human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression. We show that RTS results  not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 16p, but also from  point mutations in the CBP gene itself. Because the patients are heterozygous for the mutations, we propose that the loss of one functional copy of the CBP  gene underlies the developmental abnormalities in RTS and possibly the  propensity for malignancy",7630403,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. The known genetic causes are a microdeletion at 16p13.3 or mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) at 22q13 (5%). Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.","7630403, 16359492, 22269667, 14974086, 18773673, 20684013, 23432975, 22303793, 15706485, 20689175, 22991675"
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context mentions Abf1 as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and stress-dependent transcriptional modulation, but does not imply that it acts as an insulator.","Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells",27262581,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417
What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The concentrations of all CNHs and neurohormones were higher in patients with heart failure compared to normal subjects, except for free triiodothyronine (FT3), which was below normal values.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"The mutation implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome is a G-to-A mutation at position 759 of the GATA1 gene, corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.","Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers  G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but  not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a  spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose that GATA1 is an upstream regulator of the genes required for platelet  alpha-granule biogenesis",17209061,GFI1B and NBEAL2 mutations are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"23861251, 21765412, 25258341, 21765413, 24325358, 23100277"

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","No. The context only mentions modafinil and armodafinil, but does not provide any information about CEP-26401.","Context: longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect. With respect to  cognitive disturbances, animal models of cognitive deficits show clear  improvements with modafinil. In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or  more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning  with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of  modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning,  verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in  latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness  misattribution in the context of disgust recognition.
