What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression and determination of stem cell fates. In medulloblastoma, defective control of the histone code contributes to pathogenesis due to copy number aberrations of genes with","Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9).

Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development","19270706, 19747111, 19270706, 12384556","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas  depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding, Context:  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as epigenetic  regulators of gene transcription. The diversity and complexity of lncRNA genes  means that they exert their regulatory effects by a variety of mechanisms. Although there is still much to be learned about the mechanism of lncRNA  function, general principles are starting to emerge. In particular, the  application of high throughput (deep) sequencing methodologies has greatly advanced our understanding of lncRNA gene function. lncRNAs function as adaptors  that link specific chromatin loci with chromatin-remodeling complexes and  transcription factors. lncRNAs can act in cis or trans to guide, Context: Review, we summarize the current knowledge of the roles of lncRNAs in cardiac  development and ageing. After describing the definition and classification of  lncRNAs, we present an overview of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate gene  expression. We discuss the multiple roles of lncRNAs in the heart, and focus on  the regulation of embryonic stem cell differentiation, cardiac cell fate and  development, and cardiac ageing. We emphasize the importance of chromatin  remodelling in this regulation. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic and  biomarker potential of lncRNAs","29137239, 23756188, 24149621, 25855606","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
Describe RIblast,The blast cells in acute basophilic leukaemia are moderately basophilic with coarse granules. They are myeloperoxidase negative but express myeloid and monocyte markers.,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Magnaporthe oryzae, rice blast fungus, is the most devastating  pathogen of rice. It has emerged as a model phytopathogen for the study of  host-pathogen interactions. A large body of data has been generated on different aspects of biology of this fungus and on host-pathogen interactions. However,  most of the data is scattered and is not available as a single resource for  researchers in this field. DESCRIPTION: Genomic Resources of Magnaporthe oyzae (GROMO), is a specialized,  and comprehensive database for rice blast fungus, integrating information from  several resources. GROMO contains information on genomic sequence, mutants, Context: alpha satellite DNA probe revealed a single fluorescence spot in 80.5-97.5% of  interphase cells indicating monosomy 7. In contrast, 83.5-92.0% of the same  cells had two copies of chromosome 17 as two fluorescent spots were detected  using a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite DNA probe used as a positive  control. The proportion of interphase cells with monosomy 7 did not correlated  with the percentage of metaphase cells with monosomy 7 detected by conventional  karyotyping or with the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, Context:  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after distal radius fractures can present in 3  forms: acute, transient, and delayed. Acute CTS requires an emergent carpal  tunnel release. Many patients with transient CTS after distal radius fracture do not require surgical release of the carpal tunnel once the fracture is repaired.  Prophylactic carpal tunnel release in the absence of signs and symptoms of CTS  after a distal radius fracture is not indicated. For patients with delayed CTS after a distal radius fracture, all possible causes of nerve compression should  be considered and addressed in standard fashion, Context: Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased  risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and  non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia. We report a patient  with acute basophilic leukaemia with 47, XXY karyotype in both the tumour and  constitutional cells. Acute basophilic leukaemia is very rare disease comprising  less than 1% of all acute myeloid leukaemias. Morphological characteristic of  leukaemic blast cells is moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing a variable  number of coarse basophilic granules. The most characteristic cytochemical  reaction is metachromatic positivity with toluidine blue. Blast are myeloperoxidase negative. Also leukemic blasts express myeloid and monocyte  markers. There is no consistent chromosomal abnormality identified in this  leukaemia. This is the first reported case of acute basophilic leukaemia in patient with Klinefelter syndrome. In this article the medical history of the  patient is given and the possible connection between Klinefelter syndrome and  acute myeloid leukaemia is discussed","19604367, 8260718, 29169594, 20698148","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942

This unit details how Oligopaint  probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: Inherited Disease Panel. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to  amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA  fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors.  Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were  carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were  sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. Data from the PGM runs were  processed using an Ion Torrent Suite 3.2 software to generate sequence reads.  After sequence alignment and extraction of SNPs and indels, all the variants  were filtered against dbSNP137. DNA sequences were visualized with an Integrated Genomics Viewer. The most likely disease-causing variants were analyzed by  Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The PGM sequencing has yielded an output of 855.80 Mb, with a > 100 ×  median sequencing depth and a coverage of > 98% for the targeted regions in all the four samples. After data analysis and database filtering, one known missense  mutation (p.E1811K) and two novel premature termination mutations (p.E2264X and  p.L871FfsX23) in the FBN1 gene were identified in the three MFS patients.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,H3K4me is mentioned in the context as a mark produced by SET7/9 histone methyltransferase.,"Context: Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational  modifications of core histones. Here we show that the H1 linker histone plays a  key role in regulating both DNA methylation and histone H3 methylation at the  H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1 subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context:  Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational  modifications of core histones.

Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes","23302691, 21347206, 23302691, 19687145",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"I don't know the answer. The provided contexts mention TGF-beta treatment increasing fetal hemoglobin expression, but they do not provide specific details on how HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin.","Context:  Treatment of adult blood-derived stem cells with transforming growth factor  (TGF-beta) during the first 3-4 days in culture increases the proportions and  absolute numbers of erythroid cells subsequently expressing fetal hemoglobin (F+ cells). The change in F+ cell proportions may be due to globin switching or to  selective effects on the expansion of stem cell subpopulations with different  globin expression programs. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, we compared the effects of TGF-beta on proliferation and globin expression with the  effects of well-researched agents known to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in  sickle cell patients.

Transgenic K562 cell lines  and erythroid precursor cells from β(0)39-thalassemia patients were employed.  Gene therapy was performed with the lentiviral vector T9W. Induction of fetal  hemoglobin was obtained using mithramycin. Levels of mRNA and hemoglobins were  determined by qRT-PCR and HPLC. First, we analyzed the effect of mithramycin on  K562 transgenic cell lines harboring different copies of a lentiviral vector  carrying the human β-globin gene, showing that γ-globin mRNA expression and HbF  production can be induced in the presence of high levels of β-globin gene expression and HbA accumulation. We then treated erythroid progenitor cells from  β-thalassemic patients with T9W, which expresses the human β-globin gene and  mithramycin separately or in combination. When transduction with our lentiviral vector is insufficient to completely eliminate the unpaired α-globin chains,  combination of β-globin gene transfer therapy together with fetal hemoglobin  induction might be very efficacious to remove the excess of α-globin proteins in, Context:  The study of haemoglobin switching has represented a focus in haematology due in  large part to the clinical relevance of the fetal to adult haemoglobin switch  for developing targeted approaches to ameliorate the severity of the beta-haemoglobinopathies.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: eicosanoids and other lipids in exudates coincides with changes in the types of  inflammatory cells. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by an active class  switch in lipid mediators, such as classic prostaglandins and leukotrienes, to  the production of proresolution mediators.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No.   A mutation in the TR beta gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), but a mutant TR beta with an 11-carboxyl (C)-terminal amino acid truncation was found in a girl","Context:  Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear  thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are  transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in  the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating  levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This  ""inappropriate"" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism,  where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually, Context:  Although different expression patterns of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1  and beta1 have been reported, no essential distinction has been established in  their functions. Unlike the TR beta gene, a mutation in the TR alpha1 gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).  Previously we found a mutant TR beta with an 11-carboxyl (C)-terminal amino acid  truncation (betaF451X) in a girl with severe RTH. BetaF451X is a natural mutant with disruption of the transactivation domain, tau4, and it had very strong  dominant negative activities. Based on the fact that the 46 amino acid sequence  in the extreme C-terminal region is identical in TR alpha1 and TR beta, except, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context: Nuclear hormone receptors are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play  critical roles in chordate development and homeostasis. Aberrant nuclear hormone  receptors have been implicated as causal agents in a number of endocrine and  neoplastic diseases. The syndrome of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a  human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to  thyroid hormone. RTH is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta-gene. The resulting mutant receptors function as dominant  negatives, interfering with the actions of normal thyroid hormone receptors  coexpressed in the same cells.

We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT. Three MRT cell  lines, BT-12, G401, and RT-peri, were treated with the telomerase inhibitor  imetelstat. The effects of imetelstat on telomere length, DNA damage response, and cell proliferation were assessed. The efficacy of imetelstat in vivo was  evaluated in subcutaneous xenografts derived from each of the cell lines.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked, Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity  for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase,  imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths. Short-term imetelstat treatment also increased γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci staining in  the esophageal cancer cell lines indicating a possible induction of DNA double  strand breaks (DSBs). We also found that pre-treatment with imetelstat led to, Context: observed. These results suggest that NB-DNJ, in addition to the inhibitory  effect on CSG, also works as a ""chemical chaperone"", increasing the activity of  acid beta-glucosidase of wild-type and several GC mutated proteins, including  the most frequent N370S mutation. The specific location of the Miglustat binding  site in GC is unknown. Potential binding sites in the enzyme have been searched  for using computational molecular docking. The searching strategy identified  three potential GC binding sites for Miglustat, one being the substrate-binding  site of the enzyme, which was the best-ranked site by AutoDock program.  Therefore, it is possible that Miglustat exerts its chaperoning activity on acid beta-glucosidase by acting as an inhibitor bound at the active site.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,No. There is no mention of tomato juice in the provided context.,"Context: Lessons from recent end point trials of lipid-lowering drugs indicate that  patients at very high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) benefit from  treatment that lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels to  < or = 1.81 mmol/L (< or = 70 mg/dL), that patients with > or = 2 risk factors  benefit from treatment that lowers plasma LDL cholesterol to <2.59 mmol/L (<100  mg/dL), and that a significant reduction in CAD event rates is most often associated with a minimum plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of 30%. Recently, the  National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection,  Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) recommendations were amended to incorporate these lessons. To reach  these more aggressive goals and plasma LDL cholesterol reductions, more  aggressive therapies will be required. The best way to implement more aggressive, Context: more benefit. We investigated the effect of such lipid-lowering interventions on  atherosclerosis in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established model for  hyperlipidemia. Mice were fed a Western-type diet for 13 weeks and thereafter  matched into a baseline group (euthanized at 13 weeks) and five groups that  received diet alone (control) or with treatment [atorvastatin; atorvastatin and  alirocumab; atorvastatin and evinacumab; or atorvastatin, alirocumab, and  evinacumab (triple therapy)] for 25 weeks. We measured effects on cholesterol  levels, plaque composition and morphology, monocyte adherence, and macrophage  proliferation. All interventions reduced plasma total cholesterol (37% with atorvastatin to 80% with triple treatment; all P < 0.001). Triple treatment  decreased non-HDL-C to 1.0 mmol/l (91% difference from control; P < 0.001).  Atorvastatin reduced atherosclerosis progression by 28% versus control (P < 0.001); double treatment completely blocked progression and diminished lesion  severity.

PCSK9 at baseline independently  predicted the total/HDL cholesterol ratio response to treatment (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Plasma PCSK9 was elevated in proteinuria, predicted lipoprotein  responses to proteinuria reduction but remained unchanged after proteinuria  reduction. Inhibition of the PCSK9 pathway may provide a novel treatment  strategy in proteinuric subjects, Context:  AIMS: In observational studies, prolonged lower blood total cholesterol levels -  down at least to 3 mmol. l-1 - are associated with lower risks of coronary heart  disease. Cholesterol-lowering therapy may, therefore, be worthwhile for individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease events irrespective of their  presenting cholesterol levels.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension (essential hypertension).,"Context:  These are the preliminary data of an open multicenter trial of antihypertensive  treatment with isradipine as monotherapy (dose, 4.55 +/- 0.56 mg twice daily; n  = 11) or isradipine (7.5 +/- 0.63 mg twice daily) in combination with bopindolol (1.16 +/- 0.12 mg once daily; n = 30) administered for 3 years to patients with  essential hypertension (WHO classification I or II). Blood pressure was  significantly decreased in both treatment groups and there was no indication of resistance to therapy. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides were  decreased by the end of the second year of treatment, and there was a tendency  toward increase in plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL2, Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium.

In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg.

Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

GM interacts  directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic  regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating  formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and  independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and  phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex  dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance  in the β-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein  20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L)  result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.

Surprisingly, this  mutation did not result in significant read-through expression of downstream  RNA.

In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified and three of them  namely, WRN, BLM and RecQL4 have been linked to genetic diseases characterized  by genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. This helicase  family plays important roles in various DNA repair pathways including protecting  the genome from illegitimate recombination during chromosome segregation in  mitosis and assuring genome stability. This review mainly focuses on various  roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in  the development of cancer and premature aging, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively.

Although  several web servers and stand-alone tools were developed to address this problem, all these tools, however, can only handle one type of samples.  Furthermore, the number of their built-in properties is limited, and hence it is  often difficult for users to formulate the biological sequences according to their desired features or properties.

There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation, Context: AIM: To evaluate a simple, ear acupuncture treatment for the cessation of  smoking.

Moreover, colocalized  editing sites are often regulated by same loci. Similar to expression and  splicing QTL studies, the characterization of edQTLs will greatly expand our  understanding of cis-regulatory evolution of gene expression, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: Generation of cells with a loss-of-function mutation in a gene (knockout cells)  is a valuable technique for studying the function of a given gene product.  However, if the product of the target gene is essential for cell viability,  conditional knockout cell lines must be generated. Recently, as gene editing  technology using CRISPR/Cas9 has developed, it has become possible to produce  conditional knockout cell lines using this technique. However, to obtain final  conditional knockout cell lines, it is necessary to perform several experiments  with multiple complicated steps. In this paper, we introduce an easy and  efficient method to generate conditional knockout cell lines based on combining auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Our  method only requires performing a single transfection and is therefore an easy  and rapid method to obtain a conditional knockout cell line, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, LDB1, Ski.","Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: localized in the cytoplasm, where its function nevertheless is poorly  characterized. In this work we have observed that in normal skin as well as in  primary cultures of human keratinocytes, cytoplasmic localization of CycD1  correlated with the degree of differentiation of the keratinocyte.

Consistent  with this hypothesis, CycD1 overexpression increased β1 integrin recycling and  drastically reduced the ability of keratinocytes to adhere to the extracellular matrix.

A neuroblastoma cell line TGW was also immunostained  positively for p27KIP1 in the cytoplasm after differentiation induction, and  western blot analysis revealed an increase of p27KIP1 in these cells,  corroborating the in vivo observations. JAB1, which is thought to bind p27KIP1  and transport it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for  proteasome/ubiquitin-mediated degradation, was found to be localized both in the  cytoplasm and the nucleus in undifferentiated and differentiating tumors whereas  located predominantly in the nucleus of differentiated tumor cells. These data  indicate that the cytoplasmic localization of p27KIP1 in the process of differentiation is due to upregulation of p27KIP1 synthesis and subsequent  degradation and suggest a role of p27KIP1 in differentiation of neuroblastoma, Context: The photocytotoxicity characteristics of aluminium phthalocyanine chloride  (AIPc), aluminium phthalocyanine disulphonate (AlS2Pc), aluminium phthalocyanine  tetrasulphonate (AlS4PC) and haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) were compared  using primary cultures of human meningioma cells.

Using a suite of neuroinformatic resources, we showed that many of the  shared genes are implicated in the postsynaptic density (PSD), expressed in  immune tissues and co-expressed in developing human brain. Using a translational  cross-species approach, we detected two distinct genetic components that were  both shared by each of the six disorders; the 1st component is involved in CNS development, neural projections and synaptic transmission, while the 2nd is  implicated in various cytoplasmic organelles and cellular processes. Combined,  these genetic components account for 20-30% of the genetic load. The remaining risk is conferred by distinct, disorder-specific variants.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes.

We show that it is bound by  the RFX1 protein and identify thousands of conserved motif instances, suggesting  a broad role for the RFX family in gene regulation. A second group of motifs  (LM2*) does not match any previously known motif. We demonstrate by biochemical  and computational methods that it defines a binding site for the CTCF protein,  which is involved in insulator function to limit the spread of gene activation.  We identify nearly 15,000 conserved sites that likely serve as insulators, and  we show that nearby genes separated by predicted CTCF sites show markedly  reduced correlation in gene expression. These sites may thus partition the human genome into domains of expression, Context: described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains, Context: include 16 previously known regulatory elements, such as the histone 3'-UTR  motif and the neuron-restrictive silencer element, as well as striking examples  of novel functional elements.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. It has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against 3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations and rotenone-induced neuronal damage by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.,"Context: locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can  be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%.

Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.
