What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have identified recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in human diseases. Unlike genetic  mutations, however, they do not change the underlying DNA sequences. Epigenetic  phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with  many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the  methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput  screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a  miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for  methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it","23179372, 14688019, 14688019, 19270706, 23557020","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene encodes for DNA polymerase θ in humans. This is explicitly stated in the first sentence of the context.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by, Context: 3'-phosphotransferase kanamycin kinase.

Twelve paired primary  samples from un-treated RB patients (primary RB samples and corresponding  adjacent normal retinal samples) and eight recurrent RB samples from RB patients  having recurrence after treatment were collected. Ribosomal-RNA depleted  sequencing was performed in four paired primary samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to validate circRNA and mRNA expression in the  other eight paired primary samples and in eight recurrent RB samples.  Bioinformatic analysis was applied to predict the oncological signal pathways and the binding microRNA (miRNA) of circRNA. As a result, a total of 47640  circRNAs were identified by RNA-sequencing, with a lower abundance of circRNAs  in primary RB samples relative to matched normal retinal samples [22366 (47%), Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, there are four lncRNAs regulated by Sam68. They are Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. This information","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks. Seven mRNAs (ANKRD34A, FMODA, GJA3, CNTN5, BMP10, BAI2  and HS3ST6) were involved in both networks of LNC_00035 and LNC_000466. Differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling pathways, such as  ""phosphorylation"", ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"", ""endocytosis"" and  ""MHC protein complex"". LNC_000792, LNC_000215, LNC_000035 and LNC_000310, with, Context: analysis revealed that ABCG1 may be involved in the regulation between lncRNA  AL355711 and MMP3 in atherosclerotic CAD. The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD, Context: differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated  JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to  chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2  revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an  important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of  MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin  distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by  which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment","29137239, 29137239, 29228702, 34608503, 24374312","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition characterized by the subluxation of the lens due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It often results in a marked loss of visual acuity and can be associated","Context: Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that affects the spatial vision of one or  both eyes in the absence of an obvious organic cause; it is associated with a  history of abnormal visual experience during childhood. Subtypes have been  defined based on the purported etiology, namely, strabismus (misaligned eyes)  and/or anisometropia (unequal refractive error). Here we consider the usefulness  of these subclassifications, Context: To diagnose normal pupillary function, pupils need to be isocoric and react  bilaterally equally to light. Anisocoria indicates a problem of the efferent  pupillary pathway. Pupillary disorders may involve the afferent pathways  (relative afferent pupillary defect) or the efferent pathways. Physiological  anisocoria is a harmless condition that has to be distinguished from Horner's  syndrome. In this case pharmacological testing with cocaine eye-drops is  helpful. Disorders of the parasympathetic system will impair the light response.  They include dorsal midbrain syndrome, third-nerve palsy, and tonic pupil. Tonic  pupils are mainly idiopathic and do not need imaging. Disorders of the iris, including application of cholinergic agents, need also to be considered in  impaired pupillary light reaction, Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a connective tissue  disorder characterized by abnormalities of the lens of the eye, short stature,  brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and cardiovascular defects. The ocular problems,  typically recognized in childhood, include microspherophakia (small spherical  lens), myopia secondary to the abnormal shape of the lens, ectopia lentis  (abnormal position of the lens), and glaucoma, which can lead to blindness. Height of adult males is 142-169 cm; height of adult females is 130-157 cm.  Autosomal recessive WMS cannot be distinguished from autosomal dominant WMS by  clinical findings alone. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis WMS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features. Identification of biallelic pathogenic  variants in ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17, or LTBP2 or of a heterozygous pathogenic variant  in FBN1 by molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis if clinical, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: recent developments in this area of study have been described in greater detail,  in particular the discovery of AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation of RNA  synthesized by RNA polymerase III, which has not been discussed previously. Data  on AAUAAA-independent polyadenylation catalyzed by noncanonical TRAMP  poly(A)-polymerases (Trf4 and Trf5) have been presented in the third section.  These enzymes promote rapid degradation of RNAs by adding a short poly(A) tail  to them. This mechanism enables the recognition, poly(A)-marking, and  elimination of incorrectly folded noncoding transcripts (e.g. ribosomal and  transfer RNAs), Context: mRNA is subsequently degraded. In eukaryotes, Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) and Hbs1  are responsible for solving general problems of ribosomal stall in translation.  In archaea, aPelota and aEF1α, homologous to Pelota and Hbs1, respectively, are  considered to be involved in that process. In recent years, great progress has  been made in determining structures of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1α. In this  review, we focus on the functional roles of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1α in  ribosome rescue, based on recent structural studies of them.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, according to the context, piRNAs are indeed involved in gene silencing. They protect essential genes from RNA silencing by preventing them from being misrouted into the RNAi pathway. In addition, they play","Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell  proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating  RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing, Context: Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were reported in 2006 as a novel class of small  non-coding RNAs associated with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute/Piwi family.  Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles  in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in  epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In addition,  the function of this pathway in somatic cells has also been more systematically characterized. The new findings reveal the Piwi-piRNA pathway as a more general  mechanism of gene regulation, Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world, Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown. This strongly correlates with  enrichment of two histone H3 modifications (dimethylation of lysine 79 and","26279487, 26279487, 23465540, 23124062, 21764773",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

This unit details how Oligopaint  probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: This work is concerned with more complex geometric properties, i.e., the  complete shape formed by genomic regions. Our work is based on statistical shape  theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures,  e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution,  and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions. We found that geometric normalization  with respect to the nucleus shape based on non-rigid image registration has a, Context: in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results  in suboptimal staining.Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based  on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy  number changes within the same cell.

The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on what the minimal genome build is. The context discusses the concept of a minimal genome, its potential impacts, and the challenges in defining it, but it does not specify what the actual minimal gen","Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell, Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced, Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this  goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for  functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can  then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal  genome has not been discovered. This review analyzes the organisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pelagibacter ubique, Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Prochlorococcus  marinus as models of heterotrophic symbiont, heterotrophic free-living,  autotrophic symbiont and autotrophic free-living organisms respectively and compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most  closely resembles a true minimal genome.

Certain of the component parts are well known, but  the overall picture is blurred and often confusing. Small genome species have chromosomes in their interphase nuclei disposed in diffuse chromosome  territories, without any Rabl arrangement, while in large genomes the  chromosomes run string-like through the nucleus with a Rabl orientation following through the cell cycle. What happens in genomes of intermediate size  is either a bit of both, depending on the tissue being studied, or still remains  to be determined.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1). This is stated in the first sentence of the context.","Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context:  A novel histone methyltransferase, termed Set9, was isolated from human cells.  Set9 contains a SET domain, but lacks the pre- and post-SET domains. Set9  methylates specifically lysine 4 (K4) of histone H3 (H3-K4) and potentiates transcription activation. The histone H3 tail interacts specifically with the  histone deacetylase NuRD complex. Methylation of histone H3-K4 by Set9 precludes  the association of NuRD with the H3 tail. Moreover, methylation of H3-K4 impairs Suv39h1-mediated methylation at K9 of H3 (H3-K9). The interplay between the Set9  and Suv39h1 histone methyltransferases is specific, as the methylation of H3-K9  by the histone methyltransferase G9a was not affected by Set9 methylation of, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes, Context: chaperones, CAF-1 and Asf1, regulate DNA replication and chromatin assembly.  CAF-1 function is largely restricted to non-transcriptional processes in  heterochromatin, whereas Asf1 regulates transcription together with another  H3/H4 chaperone, HIR. This study examined the role of the yeast H3/H4 histone  chaperones, Asf1, HIR, and CAF-1 in chromatin dynamics during transcription.  Unexpectedly, CAF-1 was recruited to the actively transcribed region in a  similar way to HIR and Asf1. In addition, the three histone chaperones  genetically interacted with Set2-dependent H3 K36 methylation. Similar to  histone chaperones, Set2 was required for tolerance to excess histone H3 but not to excess H2A, suggesting that CAF-1, Asf1, HIR, and Set2 function in a related  pathway and target chromatin during transcription","27131378, 11850410, 21347206, 19687145, 19403047",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had to be aged 18 years, Context: The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) against epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) are widely used in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  However, EGFR T790M mutation leads to resistance to most clinically available  EGFR TKIs. Third-generation EGFR TKIs against the T790M mutation have been in  active clinical development.

Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?,"Yes, a de novo mutation in FGFR3 causes achondroplasia. The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A),","Context: common form of human dwarfism. Despite many studies, there is no consensus about  the exact mechanism underlying the pathology. To gain further understanding into  the physical basis behind the disorder, here we measure the activation of  wild-type and mutant FGFR3 in mammalian cells using Western blots, and we  analyze the activation within the frame of a physical-chemical model describing  dimerization, ligand binding, and phosphorylation probabilities within the  dimers. The data analysis presented here suggests that the mutation does not  increase FGFR3 dimerization, as proposed previously. Instead, FGFR3 activity in  achondroplasia is increased due to increased probability for phosphorylation of the unliganded mutant dimers. This finding has implications for the design of  targeted molecular treatments for achondroplasia, Context: increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals,  suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals  are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal  dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In  contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and  affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia  parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome  4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains  a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent  missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3  protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant  genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that  recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the, Context: Achondroplasia is a common form of human dwarfism with characteristically  rhizomelic shortening of extremities and relative macrocephaly. It is  transmitted as an autosomally dominant inheritance, and about 80% of affected  individuals result from sporadic mutations without positive family histories.  Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth  factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development. The most common genetic  mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in  the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380. Based on genetic information, molecular genetic testing can provide an exact diagnosis comparing  to radiological and prenatal ultrasound evaluations. Here we introduce  denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for the detection of, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth  factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA from seven sporadic cases of achondroplasia was studied by using PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes. RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene  mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid  and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of  achondroplasia, Context:  Achondroplasia is the best described and most common form of the congenital  short-limbed dwarfing conditions. Achondroplasia is apparent at birth and has a  birth prevalence of 1 in 20000-30000 live-born infants. Achondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, although 80% of cases occur  sporadically as new events in their families. Achondroplasia is caused, in  virtually all of the cases, by a G380R mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Patients with achondroplasia should be evaluated by a  multidisciplinary team of clinicians including geneticists, neurologists, and  orthopedists, since there are numerous bony and neurological complications.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"Yes, HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels by affecting regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These","Context:  Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics. Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that, Context: intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region.

Our results  further designate MYB as a target for therapeutic induction of HbF to ameliorate  sickle cell and β-thalassemia disease severity, Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is  marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin, Context:  Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) modulates the phenotype of sickle cell anemia by  inhibiting deoxy sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization. The blood concentration  of HbF, or the number of cells with detectable HbF (F-cells), does not measure the amount of HbF/F-cell. Even patients with high HbF can have severe disease  because HbF is unevenly distributed among F-cells, and some cells might have  insufficient concentrations to inhibit HbS polymerization. With mean HbF levels of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the distribution of HbF/F-cell can greatly vary, even  if the mean is constant.

Does TIMELESS-TIPIN participate in replisome disassembly?,"No, based on the provided context, TIMELESS-TIPIN is not mentioned to be involved in replisome disassembly. The context discusses various factors and mechanisms related to DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and","Context: the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a  hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister  chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial  and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be  involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion.  The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for  replication accessory proteins in this process, Context:  Blocks in replication result from impediments to the advancing replication  machinery and are lethal if not resolved. The replication fork must be  reassembled for DNA synthesis to proceed. Fork assembly outside the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) is mediated by recombination or via a  helicase-dependent pathway. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites  initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. We review evidence suggesting that R-loops are frequent during normal cell growth  and that R-loops are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. We  propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by, Context: we examined involvement of the currently known or implicated mechanisms of  endogenous chromosome breakage, including errors in replication fork restart,  premature mitotic chromosome condensation, spindle tension, anaphase, and  cytokinesis. Results revealed that chromosome breakage at RSZs is independent of  the RAD52 epistasis group genes and of TOP3, SGS1, SRS2, MMS4, or MUS81,  indicating that homologous recombination and other recombination-related  processes associated with replication fork restart are unlikely to be involved.  We also found spindle force, anaphase, or cytokinesis to be dispensable. RSZ  breakage, however, required genes encoding condensin subunits (YCG1, YSC4) and topoisomerase II (TOP2). We propose that chromosome break formation at RSZs  following Mec1 inactivation, a model for mammalian fragile site breakage, is  mediated by internal chromosomal stress generated during mitotic chromosome  condensation, Context: suppressors of the synthetic lethality between elg1 and ctf4. We describe  genetic interactions between ELG1 and genes encoding cohesin subunits and their  accessory proteins. We also show that defects in Elg1 lead to higher precocious  sister chromatid separation, and that Ctf18 and Elg1 affect cohesion via a joint  pathway. Finally, we localize both Ctf18 and Elg1 to chromatin and show that  Elg1 plays a role in the recruitment of Ctf18. Our results suggest that Elg1,  Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork  with respect to the cohesin ring, Context: The condensin complex is a key determinant of mitotic chromosome architecture.  In addition, condensin promotes resolution of sister chromatids during anaphase,  a function that is conserved from prokaryotes to human. Anaphase bridges  observed in cells lacking condensin are reminiscent of chromosome segregation  failure after inactivation of topoisomerase II (topo II), the enzyme that  removes catenanes persisting between sister chromatids following DNA  replication. Circumstantial evidence has linked condensin to sister chromatid  decatenation but, because of the difficulty of observing chromosome catenation,  this link has remained indirect. Alternative models for how condensin facilitates chromosome resolution have been put forward. Here, we follow the  catenation status of circular minichromosomes of three sizes during the  Saccharomyeces cerevisiae cell cycle. Catenanes are produced during DNA replication and are for the most part swiftly resolved during and following  S-phase, aided by sister chromatid separation. Complete resolution, however,  requires the condensin complex, a dependency that becomes more pronounced with","11287619, 15569610, 23133392, 19430531, 24062159",Yes.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"Yes, avelumab is effective for bladder cancer. The context states that avelumab has shown antitumor activity in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma (","Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma. Yet the challenge for clinicians is to  determine the optimal choice of agents as first-line or second-line therapy and  which offers the best chance for overall survival for the individual patient in this rapidly changing field, Context: unchanged for the last 20-30 years. Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and  its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown  promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and  PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could  potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical  efficacy, Context: (40 [16%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21  (8%) of 249 patients, the most common of which were fatigue (four [2%]), and  asthenia, elevated lipase, hypophosphataemia, and pneumonitis in two (1%)  patients each. 19 (8%) of 249 patients had a serious adverse event related to  treatment with avelumab, and one treatment-related death occurred (pneumonitis). INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients  with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety  profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients. These data provide the  rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis. FUNDING: Merck KGaA, and Pfizer Inc, Context: by independent review. Safety analysis was done in all patients who received at  least one dose of avelumab. Antitumour activity was assessed in post-platinum  patients who received at least one dose of avelumab. This trial is registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort of  patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma is closed and the trial is  ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2014, and March 15, 2016, 329 patients with advanced  metastatic urothelial carcinoma were screened for enrolment into this study; 249  patients were eligible and received treatment with avelumab for a median of 12  weeks (IQR 6·0-19·7) and followed up for a median of 9·9 months (4·3-12·1). Safety and antitumour activity were evaluated at data cutoff on June 9, 2016. In  161 post-platinum patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, a best overall  response of complete or partial response was recorded in 27 patients (17%; 95% CI 11-24), including nine (6%) complete responses and 18 (11%) partial  responses. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (any grade in ≥10%  patients) were infusion-related reaction (73 [29%]; all grade 1-2) and fatigue, Context: second-line setting, and only vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines  Agency (EMEA) in Europe. However, targeting the programmed cell-death 1  (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) agents  has shown encouraging results. Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 antibody that is  currently being investigated in several trials. Areas covered: In this review  article, we summarise preclinical, clinical, and safety data on avelumab for UC,  and describeongoing trials that are evaluating avelumab for local or advanced  diseases. We also compare its place in the management of UC. Expert opinion:  Avelumab has shown clinical efficacy for metastatic and advanced UC in phase I studies after the failure of platinum-based therapy with a well-tolerated safety  profile. This anti-PD-L1 targeting agent has the capacity to induce  antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated tumor cell lysis compared to other ICI.

What is the purpose of the Tokuhashi scoring system?,"Yes, the Tokuhashi scoring system is used to predict life expectancy in patients with spinal metastases. It was developed to aid in selecting surgical candidates by estimating survival time after diagnosis. The system takes into account various factors","Context: calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score  and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38,  respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system  overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system  underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS: Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict  prognosis of spinal metastases after operation. Tokuhashi scoring system can predict early death more accurately, which can be used to avoid major operation  for these patients, Context: BACKGROUND: One of the most important selection criteria for spinal metastases  surgery is life expectancy and the most important system for this prediction has  been proposed by Tokuhashi. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive  value of the Tokuhashi score for life expectancy in Iranian patients with spinal  metastases one year after diagnosis. METHODS: From February 2007 to March 2009, of 180 patients suffering spinal  metastatic tumors, 71 patients were excluded. This left a study population of  109 patients with known malignant metastases to spine (56 females and 53 males;  mean age, 57 ± 12 years). Tokuhashi revised evaluation system for the prognosis of metastatic spinal tumors was used for all patients. The survival period  predicted by this system for the prognosis and the actual survival period after  1 year follow up were evaluated. RESULTS: The predicted survival according to Tokuhashi prognostic scoring system  was less than 6 months in 38(34.9%) patients, 6-12 months in 39(35.8%) patients  and 1 year or more in 32(29.4%) patients. 39 (35.8%) patients died at first, Context: patients with high grade primary tumor of lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract,  esophagus, bladder and pancreas was 4. 7 months. The median survival time of 146  patients with low grade primary tumor of thyroid, breast and prostate was 12  months. The median survival time of 146 patients with medium grade primary tumor  of kidney, lymphoma, ovary and uterus, and unknown primary tumor was 7. 1  months. The median survival time of 211 patients with the Tokuhashi revised  score of 0 to 8 points was 4 months. The median survival time of 147 patients  with the Tokuhashi revised score of 9 to 11 points was 10 months. The median  survival time of 89 patients with the Tokuhashi revised score of 12 to 15 points was 29 months. The differences between the groups were significant (P<0. 01 or  0. 0001). The Tokuhashi revised score was positively correlated with survival  time (r=0. 833, P<0. 001). CONCLUSION: The Tokuhashi revised score could support decision making with  reliable estimation of life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases.  Surgery could be a better choice to extend life span for those patients with, Context: surgical procedure for spinal metastases. This study was to evaluate Tomita and  Tokuhashi scoring systems in selecting surgical procedure and predicting  prognosis of extradural spinal metastases.  METHODS: A total of 169 patients with spinal metastases, treated in the Spine  Unit of Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, from Jan. 2001 to Apr. 2004, were  enrolled. The life expectancy was scored according to both Tomita system and  Tokuhashi system before operation, the spinal metastases were classified  according to Tomita system, and the patients underwent surgery accordingly.  Follow-up was done 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. The precise of Tomita system and Tokuhashi system in estimating ""death within 3 months"", ""death within  6 months"", and ""death within 12 months"" was compared using Receiver Operating  Characteristic curves (ROC curves). The mean survival time of the patients was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score, Context:  Spine is the primary bone site affected by systemic metastasis. Although there  are scales that attempt to manage these patients, their real applicability is  unknown. The Tokuhashi Scoring System (TSS) is a widely used prognostic tool. At the time of treatment, the data necessary to complete TSS may be incomplete,  making its application impossible. Objective To evaluate the number of TSS  scores completed by the time the clinical therapeutic decision was made. Methods From July 2010 to January 2012, we selected patients who were diagnosed with  spinal metastases.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,"Yes, HER-2 belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor receptors. This is stated in the first sentence of the context where it says ""HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of trans","Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context: first 12 weeks of treatment. Fifteen patients received combined therapy: Seven  patients (47%) experienced disease progression, 5 patients (33%) had stable  disease, and 3 patients (20%) had a decline > or = 50% in prostate specific  antigen PSA level or in soft tissue disease. HER-2 overexpression was found in  significant proportions only in AI metastatic tissue samples (42% HER-2  positive; 95% confidence interval, 14-60%). In three of nine matched pairs, the  AD prostate biopsy was HER-2 negative, and the AI metastatic sample was HER-2  positive. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab is not effective as a single agent for the treatment of  patients with AI HER-2 negative tumors. HER-2 expression varies by clinical state in patients with prostate carcinoma: Accurate HER-2 profiling requires  sampling metastatic tissue in patients with metastatic disease. Further  development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of  sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2  positive tumors, Context: imaged breast cancer cases enriched with equivocally scored (2+) cases. Image  features are generated based on the staining profile of the positive control  tissue and pixels delineated by a newly developed Membrane Isolation Algorithm.  Evaluation of results was performed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)  analysis. RESULTS: A computer-aided diagnostic approach has been developed using a  membrane isolation algorithm and quantitative use of positive immunostaining  controls. By incorporating internal positive controls into feature analysis a  greater Area Under the Curve (AUC) in ROC analysis was achieved than feature  analysis without positive controls. Evaluation of HER2 immunostaining that utilized membrane pixels, controls, and percent area stained showed  significantly greater AUC than manual scoring, and significantly less false  positive rate when used to evaluate immunohistochemically equivocal cases. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that by incorporating both a membrane isolation  algorithm and analysis of known positive controls a computer-assisted diagnostic  algorithm was developed that can reproducibly score HER2 status in IHC stained, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of, Context: trastuzumab-like IgG. For simplification and to avoid methodological limitations  of synthesis and coupling chemistry, we herewith present a novel and optimized  approach by using adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as effective and high-density  mimotope-display system, which can be directly used for vaccination. METHODS: An AAV capsid display library was constructed by genetically  incorporating random peptides in a plasmid encoding the wild-type AAV2 capsid  protein. AAV clones, expressing peptides specifically reactive to trastuzumab,  were employed to immunize BALB/c mice. Antibody titers against human HER-2 were  determined, and the isotype composition and functional properties of these were tested. Finally, prophylactically immunized mice were challenged with human  HER-2 transfected mouse D2F2/E2 cells. RESULTS: HER-2 mimotope AAV-vaccines induced antibodies specific to human HER-2.

CGRP is believed to play a major role in the  pathophysiology of migraine. Eptinezumab, delivered by intravenous (IV)  administration, is being developed by Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals for  the prevention of migraine. In February 2020, eptinezumab was approved in the USA for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. This article summarizes  the milestones in the development of eptinezumab leading to this first approval, Context: BACKGROUND: PROMISE-2 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of repeat  intravenous (IV) doses of the calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeted  monoclonal antibody eptinezumab (ALD403) for migraine prevention in adults with  chronic migraine. This report describes the results of PROMISE-2 through  24 weeks of treatment.  METHODS: Patients received up to two 30-min IV administrations of eptinezumab  100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo separated by 12 weeks. Patients recorded migraine and  headache endpoints in a daily eDiary. Additional assessments, including patient-reported outcomes, were performed at regularly scheduled clinic visits  throughout the 32-week study period (screening, day 0, and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,  16, 20, 24, and 32). RESULTS: A total of 1072 adults received treatment: eptinezumab 100 mg, n = 356;  eptinezumab 300 mg, n = 350; placebo, n = 366. The reduction in mean monthly  migraine days observed during the first dosing interval (100 mg, - 7.7 days;, Context: from baseline compared to placebo. The ≥50% and ≥ 75% migraine responder rates  (MRRs) increased after a second dose, with more eptinezumab-treated patients  experiencing migraine response than placebo patients (≥50% MRRs weeks 13-24:  100 mg, 61.0%; 300 mg, 64.0%; placebo, 44.0%; and ≥ 75% MRRs weeks 13-24:  100 mg, 39.3%; 300 mg, 43.1%; placebo, 23.8%). The percentages of patients who  improved on patient-reported outcomes, including the Headache Impact Test and  Patient Global Impression of Change, increased following the second dose  administration at week 12, and were greater with eptinezumab than with placebo  at all time points. No new safety concerns were identified with the second dose regarding the incidence, nature, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse  events. CONCLUSION: Eptinezumab 100 mg or 300 mg administered IV at day 0 and repeated  at week 12 provided sustained migraine preventive benefit over a full 24 weeks and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in patients with chronic migraine.

We  undertook a phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of  alemtuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced stage cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of eight patients were enrolled, seven with  mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS) and one with large-cell transformation  of MF. Seven patients had disease refractory to multiple previous therapies.  Alemzumab (30 mg) was administered intravenously three times per week for 12 wk or until maximum response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 38%, with three patients achieving  partial remission, two patients with stable disease and three patients with progressive disease (PD) during treatment. The time to progression was short,  with all patients developing PD within 4 months of starting alemtuzumab.  Response duration in the three PR patients was also brief, with responses, Context: Likewise, prevention of bleeding was also observed in more than two thirds of  patients without inhibitors to FVIII. One antidrug antibody to emicizumab has  been reported in over 600 treated patients, two have developed thromboembolic  events and three thrombotic microangiopathy. These thrombotic complications have  occurred in conjunction with FVIII-bypassing agents, and none have been observed  following recommendations from the manufacturer regarding concomitant use of  bypassing agents. The median annual treated bleeding rates were decreased in  patients with as well as those without an inhibitor to FVIII. CONCLUSION: The principal advantage of emicizumab is subcutaneous administration and effectiveness irrespective of the presence of inhibitors. Emicizumab could  conceivably represent a new epoch in the treatment of people with haemophilia A","32266704, 33023473, 33023473, 12950233, 30431213",Eptinezumab is administered intravenously.,32266704
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, based on the context, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. The context states that DICO induces Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release, indicating that Bax has the ability to trigger the","Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors, Context: Cell death plays an important role in a number of physiological processes in all  complex multicellular organisms. One of the molecules that regulates this  process is BAX, an integral membrane protein, that promotes apoptosis. The  function of BAX is countered by BCL-2 and BCL-XL. The differential expression of  these proteins can influence the ability of the cell to die or survive. In this  paper, we describe the cloning, biochemical, and functional characterization of a novel splice isoform of BAX, called BAX-omega. Transient overexpression of  BAX-omega protein potentiates cell death at levels comparable to that of  BAX-alpha overexpression, Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis, Context:  A popular model of BCL-2 and BAX involvement in apoptosis suggests that upon  apoptosis induction cytosolic BAX translocates to the mitochondria, where it  displays the pro-apoptotic function, which involves its homodimerization. BCL-2 exerts anti-apoptotic function by forming heterodimers with BAX, thus  neutralizing the pro-apoptotic activity of the latter. We have shown that  irradiation of the human myeloma cell line RPMI-8226 induced apoptosis as determined by DNA degradation, cytochrome c release into cytoplasm and BCL-2  caspase-mediated cleavage. BCL-2 protein was present only in the membrane  fraction, whereas BAX was found both in cytosol and membranes isolated from, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the","23567243, 9565621, 21069436, 11340567, 23475110","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

How is Hsd17b1 associated with endometriosis?,"Yes, HSD17B1 is associated with endometriosis. The Ser312Gly polymorphism in HSD17B1 was found to have a significant association with endometriosis in a Japanese population","Context: HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype:  adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI  1.08-8.43).

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in  HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of  HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis, Context: METHODS: All participants underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, and the stage of  endometriosis was determined according to the Revised American Fertility Society  classification. Of the 138 women enrolled, 59 had no endometriosis, 21 had stage  I, 10 had stage II, 23 had stage III and 25 had stage IV. SNPs were  discriminated by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. RESULTS: Individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of  HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype:  adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI  1.08-8.43).

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of  HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis, Context: data has revealed strong candidates for the causal SNPs within these critical  regions; however, the molecular pathogenesis of these SNPs is currently unknown.  We used gene expression data collected from whole blood from 862 individuals and  endometrial tissue from 136 individuals from independent populations of European  descent to examine the mechanism underlying endometriosis susceptibility.  Association mapping results from 7,090 individuals (2,594 cases and 4,496  controls) supported rs3820282 as the SNP with the strongest association for  endometriosis risk (P = 1.84 × 10−5, OR = 1.244 (1.126-1.375)). SNP rs3820282 is  a significant eQTL in whole blood decreasing expression of LINC00339 (also known as HSPC157) and increasing expression of CDC42 (P = 2.0 ×10−54 and 4.5x10−4  respectively). The largest effects were for two LINC00339 probes (P = 2.0  ×10−54; 1.0 × 10−34). The eQTL for LINC00339 was also observed in endometrial tissue (P = 2.4 ×10−8) with the same direction of effect for both whole blood  and endometrial tissue. There was no evidence for eQTL effects for WNT4.  Chromatin conformation capture provides evidence for risk SNPs interacting with, Context: The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is by laparoscopic visual  demonstration of ectopic endometrial lesions outside the uterus, preferably  verified by biopsy and microscopical examination. Molecular markers to  facilitate the microscopical diagnosis of endometriosis and for distinguishing  endometriosis from other benign and malignant lesions are lacking. Our aim was  to test and validate an immunohistochemical antibody panel for improved  diagnostic accuracy of endometriosis. Both CD10 and HOXA11 have been implicated  in regulation of endometrial homeostasis. Here we have analyzed the expression  pattern of these two proteins using immunohistochemistry on human tissues in a tissue microarray format. CD10 and HOXA11 expression in endometriosis lesions  were compared to expression patterns in a range of normal tissues and in  primary- and metastatic lesions of endometrial-, cervical- and ovarian cancer. HOXA11 and CD10 were expressed in 98% and 91% of endometriosis lesions and the  combined double-positive expression profile of both HOXA11 and CD10 was highly  sensitive for ectopic endometrial tissue (90%).

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in various types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. This upregulation is","Context: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a long  non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and associated  with cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the, Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1, Context: METHODS: Overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches were used for the  analysis of the biological functions of MALAT-1 RNA. Tumor growth was studied in  nude mice. For prognostic analysis, MALAT-1 RNA was detected on  paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue probes (n = 352)  using in situ hybridization. RESULTS: MALAT-1 was highly expressed in several human NSCLC cell lines. MALAT-1  expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth,, Context: bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize.  SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell  migration. Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug levels,  and an increase of E-cadherin levels. We further demonstrated that MALAT-1  promoted EMT by activating Wnt signaling in vitro. These data suggest an  important role for MALAT-1 in regulating metastasis of bladder cancer and the potential application of MALAT-1 in bladder cancer therapy, Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis.

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase  chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have  been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These  models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship  between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in  genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of  three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.  Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse  genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin  interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive  structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with, Context: more precisely. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In  large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one  homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus,  while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear  membrane. A telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar  centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. In astrocytes, these three  chromosome regions were on the membrane and not necessarily associated with  nucleoli. Therefore there are different patterns of interphase chromosome  organization in functionally distinct cell types. In contrast to the above domains, a 1p36.3 telomeric sequence embedded in a large Alu-rich and early  replicating chromosome region, was always found in an interior euchromatic  nuclear compartment in both neurons and glial cells. In double hybridizations with 1q12 and 1p36.3 probes, 1p arms were clearly separated in all cells, and  arms projected radially into the interior nucleoplasm with non-Rabl  orientations.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context there is no mention of thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations being implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The first and third block of text discuss thyroid hormone receptor beta gene mutations","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

What is the drug target for Eliquis (Apixaban)?,"Yes, the drug target for Eliquis (Apixaban) is coagulation factor Xa. This is explicitly stated in the context, as Apixaban is described as a ""novel, orally active, selective, direct,","Context: indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral  anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a  promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location  in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are  small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the  active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles  vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have  been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with  favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical  trials for stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe  in terms of bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have several characteristics, such as potential interactions with other drugs  (inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein) and the inability to reverse  their anticoagulant effects, as well as concerns about poor patient compliance,, Context: Results Centre website. The direct thrombin inhibitors, and the factor Xa  inhibitors are the two major new anticoagulant drug classes under development at  present. In phase III trials, dabigatran and rivaroxaban demonstrated at least  as good performance as warfarin at reducing the rate of ischaemic stroke,  systemic embolus, and haemorrhagic ischaemic stroke, whilst maintaining a  comparable or lower rate of major bleeding events. Drug level monitoring was not  required due to stable pharmacodynamics. AZD0837, apixaban, YM-150, edoxaban and  betrixaban all showed promising results in phase II trials, as did S35972 in  animal, in vitro and ex vivo models. The future of these new anticoagulants looks encouraging, although there are still some significant challenges to  overcome. We need to consider the accumulation of long-term safety and efficacy  data, and the development of effective means of reversal of anticoagulation for the direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors, Context: desirable. Here we review the utility of currently available assays for  assessment of DOAC effect and recommend an optimal assessment strategy for each  drug, including calibrated dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays for  dabigatran and calibrated anti-Xa activity assays for the factor Xa inhibitors.  We also discuss reversal strategies, both specific and nonspecific, for each  drug, including the preferential use of idarucizumab for the reversal of  dabigatran and two agents, andexanet and ciraparantag, currently under  development for the reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, Context: BACKGROUND: apixaban (BMS-562247) (Eliquis(®)) is a novel, orally active,  selective, direct, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa). A  sensitive and reliable method was developed and validated for the measurement of  apixaban (BMS-562247) and its major circulating metabolite (BMS-730823) in human  citrated plasma for use in clinical testing. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: A 0.100 ml portion of citrated plasma sample was extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Run times were approximately 3 min. The lower limit of  quantification (LLOQ) was 1.00 ng/ml for BMS-562247 and 5.00 ng/ml for  BMS-730823. Intra- and inter-assay precision values for replicate QC control samples were within ≤5.36% for both analytes (≤7.52% at the LLOQ). The accuracy  for both analytes was within ±9.00%.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,"Yes, the molecule targeted by brodalumab is interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA). Brodalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-17","Context: siltuximab, and ramucirumab, as well as the Fc fusion proteins Factor IX-Fc and  Factor VIII-Fc; and the submission of first marketing applications for up to  five therapeutics (secukinumab, ch14.18, onartuzumab, necitumumab, gevokizumab).  Antibody therapeutics in Phase 3 studies are described, with an emphasis on  those with study completion dates in 2014, including antibodies targeting  interleukin-17a or the interleukin-17a receptor (secukinumab, ixekizumab,  brodalumab), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (alirocumab,  evolocumab, bococizumab), and programmed death 1 receptor (lambrolizumab,  nivolumab). Five antibodies with US Food and Drug Administration's Breakthrough Therapy designation (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, lambrolizumab, bimagrumab,  daratumumab) are also discussed, Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints. In light of disappointing clinical data with figitumumab and other targeted agents, it is likely that the use of  molecular markers will become important in predicting response to treatment.  This review outlines the role of IGF-1R signaling in solid tumors with a, Context: virus infection, respectively. Over the last few years, considerable efforts  have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases  to treat lymphocyte malignancies, autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity. The  rationale is that even if complete lack of BTK or ITK during development causes  severe immunodeficiency, inactivation after birth may result in a less severe  phenotype. Moreover, therapy can be transient or only partially block the  activity of BTK or ITK. Furthermore, a drug-induced B cell deficiency is  treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy. The newly developed BTK  inhibitor PCI-32765, recently renamed Ibrutinib, has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for  multiple myeloma. Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising  treatment effects also in autoimmunity. ITK inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase, but it can be expected that such drugs will also become  very useful. In this study, we present BTK and ITK with their signalling  pathways and review the development of the corresponding inhibitors, Context: Targeted therapies are widely used in cancer because of their effectiveness,  even in tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy such as kidney  or hepatocellular carcinomas. There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib. Inhibitors of KIT, a membrane receptor, are mainly represented by imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Finally, mTOR  inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are  temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus, Context: (14% [P=0.05] and 14% [P=0.05] vs. 4%). Rates of 70% improvement were not  significantly higher in the brodalumab groups. Similar degrees of improvement  were noted among patients who had received previous biologic therapy and those  who had not received such therapy. At week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the  brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups were 51% and 64%, respectively, as compared  with 44% among patients who switched from placebo to open-label brodalumab;  responses were sustained through week 52. At week 12, serious adverse events had  occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the  placebo group.

What do studies show about the effect of Induced hypothermia in premature babies?,"Yes, studies suggest that induced hypothermia could be both feasible and safe for premature babies with severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The context describes a pilot study","Context: Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with  hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or  neurodevelopmental disabilities. Little is known about applications of this  treatment to preterm newborns. Studies in animal experimental models  demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia in preterm fetuses but clinical  application to newborn infants are limited to restricted cases, as severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We present a case of therapeutic whole body  cooling in a baby at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with HIE, Context: OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with multiple organ dysfunction  syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality. There is extensive  experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in  infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety  of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a  randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants  who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at  least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress.

Infants were carefully assessed to identify adverse effects that potentially  were related to cooling and rewarming. A noncooled group (n = 10) with advanced  surgical NEC and MODS was used for comparison. Data are medians (interquartile  range), Context: Statistically significant relationships were identified between core temperature  and heart rate (P < .0001), pH (P < .0001), base excess (P = .003), and blood  clot dynamics (longer time to initial clot formation, slower rate of clot  formation, and decrease in clot strength; all P < .001) as assessed by  thromboelastography. No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted  during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no  increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who  were cooled. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC  seems both feasible and safe. Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted, Context: OBJECTIVE: To review and revise the 1987 pediatric brain death guidelines. METHODS: Relevant literature was reviewed. Recommendations were developed using  the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation)  system.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Determination of brain death in term  newborns, infants, and children is a clinical diagnosis based on the absence of  neurologic function with a known irreversible cause of coma. Because of  insufficient data in the literature, recommendations for preterm infants <37  weeks gestational age are not included in these guidelines.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, telomerase is the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat. The context states that Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor in clinical trials.","Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site, Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus  formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and  adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context:  The Escherichia coli AlkA protein is a base excision repair glycosylase that  removes a variety of alkylated bases from DNA. The 2.5 A crystal structure of  AlkA complexed to DNA shows a large distortion in the bound DNA.

The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress. These results demonstrate the  presence of important mechanisms for defense against Fol in the tomato genotype  BHRS 2,3, Context: neighbors within a few hours. The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues. On the  basis of these staining patterns, we found that many olfactory sensory neurons  in the developing mouse olfactory epithelium showed sustained caspase activity, Context: in three separate animals. Of these DEGs, 52 were overlapping DEGs. Using these  data, we determined the enriched GO terms, metabolic pathways and candidate  genes associated with meat color traits.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome. They are idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities.","Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome, Context: tumors. We report, a 14-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of  aplastic anemia (AA). Subsequent bone marrow examination and multiparametric  flowcytometric immunophenotyping revealed an evolving hypoplastic acute myeloid  leukemia. Chromosomal breakage studies using clastogenic agent mitomycin C  showed 88% stress induced chromosomal/chromatid breaks, gaps and rearrangements  revealing an underlying FA. The case emphasizes upon the role of a systematic  clinico-investigative approach in diagnosing such patients who by clinical  criteria appear to have idiopathic AA and appear phenotypically normal. A timely  and accurate diagnosis becomes vital in these cases to implement appropriate  therapy, Context: Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant  adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological  abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish.

We emphasize that the criteria essential for a  diagnosis of AES should include typical clinical presentation, longstanding clinical history and a positive skin test with the patient's blood. Because of  the rarity of AES there is a lack of awareness regarding it among many doctors, Context: OBJECTIVES: As the disease can display different clinical presentations, which  are mainly unspecific, and considering the importance of an early diagnosis and  the proper and early management of it, this study was carried out to present a  general overview of VHL.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 does have an effect on chromatin. In the context, it is described as a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression. It is also a component","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context: Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a potentially fatal bone marrow (BM) failure  syndrome. IFN-γ-producing Th1 CD4(+) T cells mediate the immune destruction of  hematopoietic cells, and they are central to the pathogenesis. However, the  molecular events that control the development of BM-destructive Th1 cells remain  largely unknown. Ezh2 is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple  cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression. We recently reported that Ezh2 is crucial for inflammatory T cell responses after allogeneic BM  transplantation. To elucidate whether Ezh2 mediates pathogenic Th1 responses in  AA and the mechanism of Ezh2 action in regulating Th1 cells, we studied the effects of Ezh2 inhibition in CD4(+) T cells using a mouse model of human AA.  Conditionally deleting Ezh2 in mature T cells dramatically reduced the  production of BM-destructive Th1 cells in vivo, decreased BM-infiltrating Th1, Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy, Context:  Ezh2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2) protein is the enzymatic component of the  Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which represses gene expression by  methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Recently, hot-spot mutations of  Ezh2 were identified in diffused large B-cell lymphomas and follicular  lymphomas. To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1,  which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the  enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine, Context: In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia  (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (Ezh2). Tumor cells show little residual H3K27 trimethylation marks compared  with controls. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 Polycomb group protein complex,  which is associated with DNA methyltransferases. Using next-generation  sequencing, we identify alteration in gene expression levels of EZH2 and acquired mutations in PRC2-associated genes (DNMT3A and JARID2) in human adult  T-ALL.

FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses.

In our material, we have, Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common autosomal dominant  muscular dystrophy caused by truncation of D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35.  Facial and shoulder-girdle muscles are preferentially affected but clinical symptoms are quite variable even within the same family. Asymmetrical muscle  involvement is also characteristic in this disease. There are no disease  specific changes on muscle pathology, and genetic diagnosis is performed by the southern blotting analysis. Recent advances provide us several ideas on possible  pathomechanisms of this complicated disease. There are several genes on  chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats. Transcription of, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advances have provided a model for understanding the  underlying molecular genetic changes in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  (FSHD). This review will highlight our current understanding and future research  directions. RECENT FINDINGS: FSHD typically results from contraction of a critical number of  D4Z4 repeats in a macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4q35. Contraction  leads to loss of DNA methylation and heterochromatin markers in the 4q35 D4Z4 region, resulting in relaxation of the chromatin structure and release of DUX4  repression. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally  epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. Stable expression of DUX4, however,","15307599, 23969240, 23196547, 22551571, 21734574",Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.,"10864616, 10487912, 21795275, 15307599, 10969520, 23143600, 7739631, 22551571, 19248726, 22525183"

Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the  pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development, Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.

At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells.

Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum.

What is ceritinib?,"Ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK inhibitor, which has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. It is used to treat","Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib, Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase, Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs, Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regulatory submissions have also been made in the EU and other countries. Phase III development is ongoing  worldwide to evaluate ceritinib both as a first- and second-line therapy for  ALK-positive NSCLC. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of, Context: Ceritinib is a highly selective inhibitor of an important cancer target,  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Because it is an investigational compound,  there is a need to develop a robust and reliable analytical method for its  quantitative determination in human plasma. Here, we report the validation of a  liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid  quantification of ceritinib in human plasma.

Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, there is a deep learning system that outperforms some dermatologists in detecting melanoma. A study trained Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture using dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. The algorithm","Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and, Context:  BACKGROUND: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate  melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger  groups of dermatologists are lacking. METHODS: Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture was trained and validated using  dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. In a comparative cross-sectional  reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were  sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating  characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean  receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71,  P = .001). LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy images with accuracy that exceeded some but not all dermatologists, Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context:  We tested the use of a deep learning algorithm to classify the clinical images  of 12 skin diseases-basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma,  intraepithelial carcinoma, actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, malignant melanoma, melanocytic nevus, lentigo, pyogenic granuloma, hemangioma,  dermatofibroma, and wart.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"No, the context does not provide information about a specific method used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions.","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: evident, especially with the discovery that about 97% of the transcriptional  output in higher organisms are represented as noncoding RNAs: rRNA, snoRNAs,  tRNA, transposable elements, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, intergenic  regions and microRNAs. MicroRNAs function by negatively regulating gene  expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs and  thus participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular  processes including: development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and  apoptosis pathways. MicroRNA expression profiles in many types of cancers have  been identified. Recent reports have revealed that the expression profiles of microRNAs change in various human cancers and appear to function as oncogenes or  tumor suppressors. Abnormal microRNA expression has increasingly become a common  feature of human cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the involvement of microRNAs in different types of cancer and their potential  use as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers in the future, Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function to control gene expression.  These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth,  differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development  and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as  cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display  altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the  mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be  addressed. Moreover, the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted. Finally, the challenges regarding the translation of  research involving microRNAs to the clinical realm will be discussed, Context: inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis  and invasion. MicroRNA targeting is mostly achieved through specific  base-pairing interactions between the 5' end ('seed' region) of the miRNA and  sites within coding and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs; target sites in  the 3' UTR diminish mRNA stability. Since miRNAs frequently target hundreds of  mRNAs, miRNA regulatory pathways are complex. Calin and Croce were the first to  demonstrate a connection between microRNAs and increased risk of developing  cancer, and meanwhile the role of microRNAs in carcinogenesis has definitively  been evidenced. It needs to be considered that the complex mechanism of gene regulation by microRNAs is profoundly influenced by variation in gene sequence  (polymorphisms) of the target sites. Thus, individual variability could cause  patients to present differential risks regarding several diseases. Aiming to provide a critical overview of miRNA dysregulation in cancer, this article  reviews the growing number of studies that have shown the importance of these  small molecules and how these microRNAs can affect or be affected by genetic and","21406606, 23407615, 20221895, 20925959, 21931505","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

These were administered to 14 patients with Ewing'","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: at the base of the bladder. No additional abnormal findings were disclosed by  other diagnostic imaging methods. The surgical specimens showed small round cell  tumor with positive staining for MIC2 gene product (CD99). EWS-FLI1 fusion  transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and  direct sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of PNET/ES. The patient developed  swollen pelvic lymph nodes as well as multiple lung metastases at 8 months  postoperatively. No effective results could be obtained even with systemic  chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide  (VIDE) based on the EUROpean Ewing tumour Working Initiative of National Groups 1999 (EURO-E.W.I.N.G. 99) multinational trial. The patient died of acute  superior mesenteric artery thrombosis at 22 months postoperatively. PNET/ES  could have been included in past cases of small cell carcinoma because of the difficulty in its differential diagnosis. Exact diagnosis is crucial for  deciding the treatment strategy for rare bladder tumors consisting of small  round cells, Context:  To apply safely an aggressive chemotherapy regimen like CESS 81 requires  intensive supportive care. Bleomycin is evaluated as part of the protocol for  treatment of primary Ewing's sarcoma. Bleomycin might cause pulmonary fibrosis at higher cumulative doses as toxic effect directly to the lungs or most likely  in addition by the formation of vascular microthrombi.

What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?,"Yes, TRH does have an effect on myocardial contractility. In rabbits following shock, TRH improved mean arterial pressure and myocardial contractility as evidenced by increased dp/dtmax, -dp","Context: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits  following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv). TRH had  no effect on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min post-treatment in rabbits pre-treated with the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 hr  before TRH treatment, iv), but the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine did  not affect these responses to TRH. Experiments in vitro show that although TRH (10(-3) to 10(-8) M) had no direct effects on the isolated heart, left atrium,  and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and  dopamine on the left atrium. These results suggest that the antishock effects of, Context: The effects of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on the contractility of  electrically stimulated and perfused isolated rat hearts were investigated. TRH  in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on  cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7 and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l, which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that,, Context: cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7  and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway, Context: TRH biosynthesis. Pro-TRH gene expression was induced in cardiac interstitial  cells after MI, and this effect was restricted to the heart, because no increase  in TRH mRNA abundance was observed in the hypothalamus, kidney, or lung.  Transcript abundance of pro-TRH can be increased in cultured cardiac fibroblasts  by several adrenergic agonists, indicating that the adrenergic axis may play a  regulatory role in cardiac TRH production. Acute intravenous administration of  TRH to rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy caused a significant increase in heart  rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac  contractility. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that TRH is specifically induced in the heart after MI and that it can increase cardiac performance in  rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thus, in addition to catecholamine and  angiotensin II, pro-TRH/TRH may be another important axis that affects hemodynamics and cardiac function in heart failure, Context:  The inotropic effect of the physiological level of TRH on isolated guinea pig  cardiac muscle was studied using a force transducer and standard microelectrode  techniques. TRH increased the contractile force of muscles dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction in normal Tyrode and a high K+  (27 mM) solution. The positive inotropic effect of TRH was associated with an  augmentation of slow action potentials in high K+ solution and was reduced in the presence of diltiazem, verapamil, and manganese. TRH potentiated the  response of contractile force to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration.  The inotropic effect of TRH was suppressed by metoclopramide, phentolamine, and","1611701, 9088928, 9088928, 15096458, 2848686",TRH improves myocardial contractility,"9088928, 9225129, 15096458, 2848686, 1611701, 1979356"
What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"Yes, the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AAUAAA. This hexamer is the most common and well-known signal for polyadenylation in eukaryotic mRNA processing. It was identified","Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation, Context:  A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in  silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants  that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation signals in the terminal sequences.

The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these  hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347  terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were, Context: hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors, Context: A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in  silico.

What is CPX-351,CPX-3,"Context: PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation.  METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a  population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome, Context: AML is highest. Therapeutic options mainly consist of hypomethylating agents,  ongoing clinical trials and, less commonly, intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.  CPX-351, a novel liposomal formulation which encapsulates cytarabine and  daunorubicin in 5:1 molar ratio, has shown promising efficacy, leading to recent  US FDA approval for front-line therapy for patients with therapy-related AML and  AML with myelodysplasia-related changes based on a large multicenter Phase III  clinical trial. This review summarizes the clinical development of CPX-351 as  induction therapy, Context: treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. In a pivotal  phase 3 study that evaluated 309 patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly  diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia, CPX-351 significantly  improved median overall survival versus conventional 7 + 3 chemotherapy  (cytarabine continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin for 3 days), with a  comparable safety profile. A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease  or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare  survival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11,  2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient was partitioned into 3 health states: TOX (time with any grade 3 or 4 toxicity  or prior to remission), TWiST (time in remission without relapse or grade 3 or 4  toxicity), and REL (time after relapse). Within each treatment arm, Q-TWiST was, Context: risk : benefit profile at least similar to biologic therapies, be more  convenient for the patient and, hopefully, be less expensive. This article  reviews the progress made in the development of these compounds over the past  year.  RECENT FINDINGS: Additional information has become available in the past year on  five oral compounds including kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, fostamatinib,  VX-509), an S1P lyase inhibitor (LX 3305) and a chemokine receptor-1 antagonist  (CCX354-C). Efficacy has been shown in phase III with tofacitinib and in phase  II with fostamatinib and VX-509; safety was the primary endpoint of the trials  of CCX354-C and LX3305. Regarding side effects, liver test elevation and neutropenia occurred with tofacitinib, VX-509 and fostamatinib; lipid elevation  with tofacitinib and VX-509; creatinine elevation and anemia with tofacitinib,  and hypertension and diarrhea with fostamatinib. SUMMARY: Compounds that inhibit tyrosine kinase pathways involved in cellular  signalling have been shown to be effective in the treatment of RA with a  reasonable risk : benefit ratio. It is too early to tell about inhibitors of  other pathways, Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrates that CPX-351 improved  quality-adjusted survival, further supporting the clinical benefit in patients  with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker. In the context, it is described as a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidylserine, whose external","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process, Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues, Context: reliability of this method. By comparing the comet assay with a flow cytometry  method that uses Annexin V binding to apoptotic cells, we have provided further  evidence for evaluating the usefulness of the comet assay for detecting  apoptosis.  METHODS: Apoptosis was induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) by ionizing radiation and measured using the comet assay and a flow  cytometry method that measures Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining.  RESULTS: The Annexin V flow cytometry assay distinguished among early apoptosis,  late apoptosis, and an apoptotic or necrotic phase in which the cells were  labeled with both Annexin V and PI. The comet assay detected only the latter two phases of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The comet assay is a useful tool for measuring the late stages of  apoptosis whereas the Annexin V assay measures higher amounts of apoptosis  because it can detect cells in an earlier stage of the apoptotic pathway, Context: The prognosis of children with high-grade glioma or high-risk neuroblastoma  remains poor. Cilengitide is a selective antagonist of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins,  which are involved in tumor growth and development of metastasis. We have  evaluated the effects of cilengitide on pediatric glioma and neuroblastoma cell  lines for the first time. Expression levels of αvβ3 and αvβ5 were determined by  flow cytometry in three neuroblastoma and five pediatric glioma cell lines  compared with adult U87-MG before and after irradiation. Cell detachment,  cytotoxicity, and cell growth under nonadhesive conditions were measured using  the MTS assay. Cell death and apoptosis were assessed by annexin-V/propidium iodide staining. The varying αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression levels were unrelated to  tumor grade. Irrespective of the αvβ5 expression level, the pediatric cells  expressing αvβ3 were dose dependently sensitive to cilengitide. UW479 cells expressed only αvβ5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting  that cilengitide's action largely depends on αvβ3 inhibition. Cell detachment  resulted in a higher cytotoxicity in pediatric glioma compared with U87-MG","16331047, 7622868, 7812008, 12116376, 23728220","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"
Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any ultraconserved elements associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context:  Embryonic stem (ES) cells offer insight into early developmental fate decisions,  and their controlled differentiation may yield vast regenerative potential. The  molecular determinants supporting ES cell self-renewal are incompletely understood. The homeodomain proteins Nanog and Oct4 are essential for mouse ES  cell self-renewal. Using a high-throughput approach, we discovered DNaseI  hypersensitive sites and potential regulatory elements along a 160-kb region of the genome that includes GDF3, Dppa3, and Nanog. We analyzed gene expression,  chromatin occupancy, and higher-order chromatin structure throughout this gene  locus and found that expression of the reprogramming factor Oct4 is required to, Context:  For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related, Context: When embryonic stem cells are allowed to aggregate, the outer layer of the  aggregated spheres (referred to as embryoid bodies) differentiates into  primitive endoderm. This initial specification of cell lineage facilitates  further differentiation of the inner mass of the embryoid bodies. These  processes are considered to recapitulate early embryonic development from the  blastocyst stage to the egg-cylinder stage. Formation of the primitive endoderm  layer in the embryoid bodies was induced solely by aggregation of embryonic stem  cells, in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor/STAT3 and serum/BMP4, which  were considered to be sufficient for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Interestingly, cell aggregation by itself induced Nanog repression at the outer  layer, which was essential for aggregation-induced primitive endoderm formation.  These data illustrate aggregation-based cell-fate specification during early embryonic development, when downregulation of Nanog plays a crucial role, Context: Heart failure is a major health problem on a global scale. Current therapies  include drug treatments, lifestyle modification, device therapy and heart  transplantation. However, the ""holy grail"" of heart failure treatment would be  to achieve widespread regeneration of diseased cardiac tissue. Examples of  regeneration of living tissue are present in nature and involve stem cells. The  two key defining properties of stem cells are their ability to renew themselves through cell division and to differentiate into various cell types. Generally,  stem cells can be classified into embryonic or adult forms. Human adult stem  cells are ethically appealing and have already been used in clinical trials in a variety of disease states. Bone marrow derived stem cells, skeletal myoblasts  and resident adult cardiac stem cells are being explored as potential cell types  for heart failure treatment. These cells can be delivered to the heart via a, Context: Testicular germ cell tumors comprise of group of pluripotent tumors including  seminomas and nonseminomas, arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia and  originate from the primordial germ cells/ gonocytes.

The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded, Context: of LACE Index for Readmission - Length of stay (days), Acute (emergent)  admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of ED visits within six months  (LACE) and Patients At Risk of Hospital Readmission (PARR) using New Zealand  hospital admissions. This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542, Context: Predictive models for hospital readmission rates are in high demand because of  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Readmission  Reduction Program (HRRP). The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States.

To study these systemic signalling pathways, we  designed and engineered a novel, highly photosensitive apparatus, dubbed  RT-Biolumicorder. This device enables us to record circadian luciferase reporter  gene expression in the liver and other organs of freely moving mice over months  in real time. Owing to the multitude of systemic signalling pathway involved in  the phase resetting of peripheral clocks the disruption of any particular one  has only minor effects on the steady state phase of circadian gene expression in organs such as the liver. Nonetheless, the implication of specific pathways in  the synchronization of clock gene expression can readily be assessed by  monitoring the phase-shifting kinetics using the RT-Biolumicorder, Context:  The mammalian circadian clock coordinates various physiological activities with  environmental cues to achieve optimal adaptation. The clock manifests  oscillations of key clock proteins, which are under dynamic control at multiple post-translational levels. As a major post-translational regulator, the  ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation system is counterbalanced by a  large group of deubiquitin proteases with distinct substrate preference.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is because recombination repair can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements, some of which may play a primary role","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis, Context:  DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki (Yorkie) are salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1. These genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis in mamm","Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five  sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein, Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan, Context: including humans, in a high-throughput manner. Here, we report, for the first  time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the  Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved  transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took  advantage of the very recently developed ""unit assembly"" strategy to assemble  two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex  chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently  injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2% of the injected F(0) fertile flies,  we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable  modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications  of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed, Context: Elav-positive neurons and the fat body of Drosophila third instar larvae.  Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a  lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly  with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Accordingly,  centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells.  As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc  domains. These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with  genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS: In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals.  Our findings support the model that peripheral heterochromatin matures enhancing  the repression of unwanted genes as cells terminally differentiate","17980593, 11528505, 10772900, 22624882, 30384843",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

It is expected that the illness will affect  about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current  Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable  of slowing down disease progression. Indeed, all currently available therapies,  such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), are  primarily considered symptomatic therapies, although recent data also suggest  possible disease-modifying effects. Gantenerumab is an investigational fully  human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and  remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.

METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective  search in PubMed, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Children and adolescents with IBD often have extensive involvement and  an aggressive course of disease. Nonetheless, infliximab and adalimumab are the  only biological agents that have been approved for this group of patients. In  Crohn's disease, exclusive enteral nutrition is the treatment of first choice for inducing a remission. Patients with (peri-)anal fistulae are treated  primarily with infliximab. Corticosteroids and aminosalicylates should be used  with caution. In contrast, children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis are treated with either aminosalicylates or prednisolone to induce a remission.

Structural and  pharmacological differences among the anti-TNF drugs are likely to result in  differences in efficacy and tolerability among the agents in the different  IMIDs, together with differences in potency, therapeutic dose ranges, dosing  regimens, administration routes, and propensity for immunogenicity. Among the  five TNF inhibitors approved for treatment of IMIDs, adalimumab has the widest  range of indications. Data from controlled clinical trials of adalimumab,  showing its excellent efficacy and tolerability in a wide range of indications,  are supported by real-world long-term data from observational studies, which confirm the value of adalimumab as a suitable choice in the management of IMIDs, Context: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic lifelong condition characterized by  alternating flare-ups and remission.

Current treatment  modalities for UC include 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,  immunosuppressants (including purine antimetabolites, cyclosporine, and  tacrolimus), and surgery. Therapeutic goals for UC are evolving. Medical  treatment aims to induce remission and prevent relapse of disease activity.  Infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α monoclonal antibody, is the first biological agent for the treatment of UC. Over the last decade, infliximab  and adalimumab (anti-TNF-α agents) have been used for moderate to severe UC, and  have been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Yes, there is a protein with HEAT repeats mentioned in the context. The Symplekin protein exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats in its structure.","Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process, Context: the use of adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the standard treatment for these  tumors, although several studies have documented that the current standard  combination chemotherapy is suboptimal. Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: organisms with complete genomic data, and all the SWISSPROT proteins obtained  from the Pfam database. All the entries in PRODOC are represented as a sequence  of functional domains, assigned using hidden Markov models, instead of as a  sequence of amino acids.

Software tools  allow the user to query the dataset with a sequence of domains and identify  proteins with the same or a jumbled or circularly permuted arrangement of  domains. As it is proposed that proteins with jumbled or the same domain  sequences have similar functions, this search tool is useful in assigning the overall function of a multi-domain protein. Unique features of PRODOC include  the generation of alignments between multi-domain proteins on the basis of the  sequence of domains and in-built information on distantly related domain families forming superfamilies.

What is protein palmitoylation?,"Yes, protein palmitoylation is the reversible attachment of a 16-carbon fatty acid (palmitate) to cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester linkage. This modification enhances","Context:  Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid  (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a  thioester linkage. Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation  site is conserved through most metazoan phlya. Although palmitoylation does not  regulate the normal forward or reverse ion transport modes of NCX1, NCX1, Context:  Protein S-palmitoylation, the covalent lipid modification of the side chain of  Cys residues with the 16‑carbon fatty acid palmitate, is the most common  acylation, and it enhances the membrane stability of ion channels. This post-translational modification (PTM) determines a functional mechanism of ion  channel life cycle from maturation and membrane trafficking to localization.  Especially, neurodevelopment is regulated by balancing the level of synaptic protein palmitoylation/depalmitoylation. Recently, we revealed the pathological  role of the transient receptor potential canonical type 5 (TRPC5) channel in  striatal neuronal loss during Huntington's disease (HD), which is abnormally, Context: Protein S-palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM)  in blood stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. S-palmitoylation  refers to reversible covalent modification of cysteine residues of proteins by  saturated fatty acids. In vivo, palmitoylation is regulated by concerted  activities of DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases (DHHC PATs) and acyl protein  thioesterases (APTs), which are enzymes responsible for protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, respectively. Here, we investigate the role of protein  palmitoylation in red blood cell (RBC) invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. We  demonstrate for the first time that free merozoites require PAT activity for microneme secretion in response to exposure to the physiologically relevant low  [K+] environment, characteristic of blood plasma.

Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth.

Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy.

We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient, Context: MAO A level and the MAOA genotype, we postulated that there are additional  regulatory mechanisms that control the MAOA expression. Given that DNA  methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that  epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression. Our underplaying  assumption was that the differences in an individual's genotype play a key role  in the epigenetic potential of the MAOA locus and, consequently, determine the  individual's level of MAO A activity in the brain. As a first step towards  experimental validation of the hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive  bioinformatic analysis aiming to interrogate genomic features and attributes of the MAOA locus that might modulate its epigenetic sensitivity. Major findings of  our analysis are the following: (1) the extended MAOA regulatory region contains  two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to  differential methylation.

In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in  transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalized following temsirolimus treatment.  In this mouse model with relatively mild disease progression, the number of  transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small.  However, the importance of these transcriptional alterations in the pathogenesis  of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 remains unclear, Context:  Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an  autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat  expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range  in Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70  clinical SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further  used in SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions.

They have the ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome, making them attractive delivery vehicles for persistent transgene expression. Initially, vectors based on simple retrov","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context: of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis  by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes.  Co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter  could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems.

Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. In fact, many tumour-associated antigens are derived from differentiation antigens that are already present in normal cells but have undergone modifications","Context: The immunohistological distribution of blood group (BG)-related antigens  including A, B, H type 2, and sialylated Lex in lung adenocarcinomas was  examined using monoclonal antibodies. BG-A, B, and H type 2 compatible with the  ABO status in tumor cells were expressed in 60% of the cases. Accumulation of H  type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of  patients with BG status other than 0. Tumor-associated antigens, Lex and sialylated Lex were detected in 36.0% and 72.0%, respectively. Modification of  carbohydrate antigens in cancer may be associated with incomplete synthesis;  accumulation of precursor antigen; and activated sialylation, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,, Context: The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune  surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides  derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules  expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now  numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated  control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the  intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of  tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to  as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma  (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting  a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to  an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with","3560450, 11599633, 28536100, 7517178, 1423320","Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the tissue of origin of the HSP.

Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex  Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with  phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four  other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of  six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31. Our case reinforces FERD3L as candidate gene for intellectual disability and  suggested that genes located in 3p21.3 can be related to hyper IgE phenotype, Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome  7p21.2.

Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears  to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as  a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome.

We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation  in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the  protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk  for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance.  Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation,  while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is  very low, Context:  BACKGROUND: Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous  phenotype. The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the  authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008). Their phenotype, need for  primary cranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperation  were recorded.

We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a  candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant  phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.

These products differ in  construct, manufacturing, clinical trial design and toxicity profile. Patient  selection for CAR T-cells, and the ideal product for a given patient, involves myriad considerations including age, fitness, prior therapies, comorbid  diseases, organ function, logistics of administration, turnaround time, and  institutional familiarity. This article reviews the proper patient and product selection for the management of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive  B-cell lymphomas, Context: April 2016, there were no licensed drugs available in the United States of  America (USA) for the treatment of PD psychosis (PDP). Pimavanserin is the first  Food and Drug Administration approved medicine for the treatment of  hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. AREAS COVERED: A MEDLINE literature search, publicly available information  provided by ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, and expert opinion were used for this  review. A review of PDP, its current treatment and limitations is followed by  the rationale for development of pimavanserin. The mechanism of action,  preclinical data, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical data supporting the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin in PDP are reviewed. We also  describe the potential benefits of pimavanserin in other contexts such as  schizophrenia and sleep disorders. EXPERT OPINION: Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of  action (5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist) and no measurable dopaminergic  activity; it has been demonstrated to be efficacious, well tolerated and safe, Context: destruction of tumor nests was seen by CGP41251 administration. In both tumor  tissues, the PKC activity of the particulate fraction was significantly  decreased by CGP41251 treatment. From these results, it is thought that the  antitumor activity of CGP41251 against human NSCLS is accompanied by the  decrease of PKC activity in the particulate fraction. Moreover, the G2/M arrest  of the cell cycle induced by CGP41251 might be important for the growth  inhibitory action of this compound, Context: The most widely prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent today in the world today is  a member of the biguanide class of drugs called metformin. Apart from its use in  diabetes, it is currently being investigated for its potential use in many  diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, obesity,  comorbidities of diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy to name a few.  Numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies as well as clinical trials have been and  are being conducted with a vast amount of literature being published every day.  Numerous mechanisms for this drug have been proposed, but they have been unable  to explain all the actions observed clinically. It is of interest that insulin has a stimulatory effect on cellular growth. Metformin sensitizes the insulin  action but believed to be beneficial in cancer. Like -wise metformin is shown to  have beneficial effects in opposite sets of pathological scenario looking from insulin sensitization point of view. This requires a comprehensive review of the  disease conditions which are claimed to be affected by metformin therapy. Such a  comprehensive review is presently lacking. In this review, we begin by examining, Context: the pivotal phase I/II trials, emerging real-world evidence and ongoing trials. RECENT FINDINGS: For decades, attempts at improvement of the poor prognosis of  patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma with new treatment regimens have been  disappointing. Since the first report of CD19-directed CAR-T-cell therapy in  2010, three constructs have been tested in large phase I/II trials and resulted  in 30-40% durable responses. This has led to Food and Drug Administration and  European Medicines Agency approval for axicabtagene ciloleucel and  tisagenlecleucel and filing of the biologics license application for  lisocabtagene maraleucel. Emerging real-world evidence seems to confirm the promising results. However, considerable toxicity, mainly cytokine release  syndrome and neurotoxicity limits their general applicability and not all  patients intended to be treated can be bridged during the manufacturing period due to kinetics of the disease. Randomized phase III clinical trials are being  conducted to test anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy in the second-line and several  phase II trials are aiming to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity","32611216, 27609312, 8822090, 27939359, 32740094","Lisocabtagene maraleucel is an autologous, CD19-directed, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product.","31099671, 32611216, 32670869, 31899702, 32888407, 31677848, 31648957, 32740094"
Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,"No, according to the context, surgical treatment of endometriomas does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management with respect to improving fertility outcomes in women undergoing IVF. In fact, laparoscopic removal of end","Context:  OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs. PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher, Context: OBJECTIVES: Endometriomas are rare in pregnancy. May be difficult to diagnose  and may cause significant complications at any stage during gestation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The author presents 2 cases of ovarian endometriomas  diagnosed and treated surgically in 14 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course, Context: recommended for women above the age of 40 and for large endometriomas. Except  for pelvic clearance, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that surgical  treatment of endometrioma is better than medical treatment with respect to the  long-term relief of symptoms and quality of life. Laparoscopic excision of  ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over  expectant management. A large, well-designed, adequately powered randomized  controlled study that compares the effects of surgical removal versus expectant  management of endometrioma on ovarian performance and pregnancy outcomes in  women undergoing IVF is warranted, Context: visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the  non-operated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients  who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower  antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with  non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present  ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and  live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF  outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of  endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins, Context: total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an  IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical  complications of laparoscopic surgery. Conversely, conservative surgical  treatment of ovarian endometriomas in symptomatic women does not impair IVF or  intracytoplasmic sperm injection success rates","15136074, 11526777, 21561807, 21679474, 15136074","Yes, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.","12419041, 15136074, 17399914, 23759693, 21561807, 8737616, 16034960, 7202738, 21679474, 18425908, 21764126, 2943896, 11526777, 22695290, 23277022, 24231199"
Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"No, evolocumab does not target an enzyme. Instead, it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9","Context: Elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with  cardiovascular diseases and statin therapy was proven to decrease LDL-C and  reduce cardiovascular death. However, in patients at high cardiovascular risk,  achievement of optimal LDL-C levels is challenging, and therefore additional  strategies for further loweing LDL-C levels are under development. Recently,  silencing of apolipoprotein B gene and MTP inhibition have been approved for the  treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and there is great  interest in the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9).  PCSK9 promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor. The inhibition of PCSK9 favors LDL catabolism and reduces plasma LDLC levels. Monoclonal antibodies  against PCSK9 represent so far the most advanced approach in clinical  development, with alirocumab, evolocumab and bococizumab under advanced clinical development. Recent data from the first phase III studies show LDL-C reduction  in monotherapy and on top of statins. Long-term studies on cardiovascular  endpoints are ongoing and the results will be crucial to translate the benefit, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies  inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it  for degradation. Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show  that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly  limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and, Context: monotherapy or on a background therapy with statins. Proprotein convertase  subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are also an excellent example of drug  development in which discovery of gene mutations and its clinical effects have  rapidly progressed into successful preclinical and clinical studies with  multiple Phases 1-3 clinical trials completed or ongoing to date. This review  summarizes the rapid evolution of the drug from genetic discovery to  identification of targets for the drugs, to animal and human testing, and to  large clinical outcomes trials, followed by discussion on foreseeable challenges  of PCSK9 inhibitors, Context: Pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted 692-amino  acid protein that binds surface low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)  and targets it toward lysosomal degradation. As a consequence, the number of  LDLRs at the cell surface is decreased, and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) clearance is  reduced, a phenomenon that is magnified by gain-of-function mutations of PCSK9.  In contrast, loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 result in increased surface  LDLR and improved LDL-C clearance. This provides the rationale for targeting  PCSK9 in hypercholesterolemic subjects as a means to lower LDL-C levels.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PCSK9 that block its interaction with the LDLR have been developed in the past decade. Two companies have recently  received the approval for their anti-PCSK9 mAbs by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Regeneron/Sanofi, with alirocumab (commercial name--PRALUENT(®)) and, Amgen with evolocumab  (commercial name--Repatha™). The introduction of anti-PCSK9 mAbs will provide an  alternative therapeutic strategy to address many of the unmet needs of current, Context: Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells.

RNA editing by adenosine  deamination (A-to-I) is widespread in humans and can lead to a variety of  biological effects depending on the RNA type or the RNA region involved in the  editing modification. Hereafter, we describe an easy and reproducible  computational protocol for the identification of candidate RNA editing sites in  human using deep transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and genome (DNA-Seq) sequencing data, Context:  BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a co-transcriptional modification that increases the  molecular diversity, alters secondary structure and protein coding sequences by  changing the sequence of transcripts. The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A→I) that is catalyzed by the members of the  Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are  identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a  method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate  RNA-seq data has not been published so far.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA-1 include FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, CTCF, Rad21, and KLF","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: The activity of hematopoietic factor GATA-1 is modulated through  p300/CBP-mediated acetylation and FOG-1 mediated indirect interaction with  HDAC1/2 containing NuRD complex. Although GATA-1 acetylation is implicated in  GATA-1 activation, the role of deacetylation is not studied. Here, we found that  the FOG-1/NuRD does not deacetylate GATA-1. However, HDAC1/2 can directly bind  and deacetylate GATA-1. Two arginine residues within the GATA-1 linker region mediates direct interaction with HDAC1. The arginine to alanine mutation (2RA)  blocks GATA-1 deacetylation and fails to induce erythroid differentiation. Gene  expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis further demonstrate the importance of GATA-1 deacetylation for gene activation and chromatin recruitment. GATA-12RA  knock-in (KI) mice suffer mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with accumulation of  immature erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen.

The relationship between  virulence and gene variation of the rgpB gene has not been investigated  extensively. However, nucleotide variations of the rgpB gene result in four  amino acid substitutions in the catalytic domain identifying five different rgpB  genotypes. They are named according to the different amino acid sequences in the  primary protein structure of RGPB and named NYPN, NSSN, NSSK, NYPK, and DYPN  (Beikler et al. 2005).

Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin, Context: with the beta-tubulin subunit facing the microtubule plus end conferring a  structural polarity. The alpha- and beta-tubulins are highly conserved. A third  member of the tubulin family, gamma-tubulin, plays a role in microtubule  nucleation and assembly. Other members of the tubulin family appear to be  involved in microtubule nucleation. Microtubule assembly is accompanied by  hydrolysis of GTP associated with beta-tubulin so that microtubules consist  principally of 'GDP-tubulin' stabilized at the plus end by a short 'cap'. An  important property of microtubules is dynamic instability characterized by  growth randomly interrupted by pauses and shrinkage. Many proteins interact with microtubules within the cell and are involved in essential functions such as  microtubule growth, stabilization, destabilization, and interactions with  chromosomes during cell division. The motor proteins kinesin and dynein use microtubules as pathways for transport and are also involved in cell division.  Crystallography and electron microscopy are providing a structural basis for  understanding the interactions of microtubules with antimitotic drugs, with, Context: simple method for peptide aptamer optimization, which can be achieved by  PCR-based random mutagenesis combined with a selection screen in yeast using a  strong selective drug. The rationale of this approach, which has proven valid  and efficient, is that stronger interaction in yeast will also lead to stronger  inhibition.

We review current evidence examining the efficacy of tranexamic acid in  improving clinical outcome after ICH. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical trial registers for  studies using search strategies incorporating the terms 'intracerebral  haemorrhage', 'tranexamic acid' and 'antifibrinolytic'. Authors of ongoing  clinical trials were contacted for further details. FINDINGS: We screened 268 publications and retrieved 17 articles after  screening. Unpublished information from three ongoing clinical trials was  obtained. We found five completed studies. Of these, two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous tranexamic acid to placebo (n = 54) reported  no significant difference in death or dependency.

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, the lectin complement pathway is activated by ficolin-3. This is stated in the context as ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway and forms complexes with serine proteases","Context: Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition  molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic  variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene  was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms  was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by  production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied  10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several  polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was  particularly interesting. In individuals heterozygous for the FCN3+1637delC  deletion lowered Ficolin-3 concentration was observed (P=0.025). SDS-PAGE and, Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators, Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has  been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of  Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common  pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause  extraintestinal, opportunistic infections, Context: (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were  all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to  SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that  Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore,  Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease  activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption  in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration","18261799, 18006063, 23142462, 25178935, 25069872",Ficolin-3 activates lectin complement pathway.,"18261799, 19939495, 21890891, 24336142, 18006063, 25069872, 25178935, 19535802, 23142462"

Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed, Context: A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the  causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012. The virus was  termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is taken  notice of important coronavirus caused severe diseases to human after the  outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. There is a lot  of unknown characterization regarding MERS-CoV because of less than one year  after finding the first case. MERS-CoV was related to the 2C betacoronavirus  clade and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and  Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Thus, bats are thought to be natural hosts of this virus. Recently, there were reports supposed to be cases of human to human  infection.

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"Yes, the transcriptional process regulating GABAergic cell fate has been studied through the analysis of alterations in schizophrenia.

Acquisition of  lineage-specific markers occurs before or during migration and/or at final  destination. What are the mechanisms that direct specification of neural crest  cells into a specific lineage and how do neural crest cells decide on a specific  migration route? Those are fascinating and complex questions that have existed  for decades and are still in the research focus of developmental biologists.  This review discusses transcriptional events and regulations occurring in neural crest cells and derived lineages, which control specification of peripheral  glia, namely Schwann cell precursors that interact with peripheral axons and  further differentiate into myelinating or nonmyelinating Schwann cells, satellite cells that remain tightly associated with neuronal cell bodies in  sensory and autonomous ganglia, and olfactory ensheathing cells that wrap  olfactory axons, both at the periphery in the olfactory mucosa and in the, Context: directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to  1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.  Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible  genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among  them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6, Context: Conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in DNA are reliable pointers to regulatory  elements controlling gene expression. Using a comparative genomics approach with  four dicotyledonous plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, papaya [Carica papaya],  poplar [Populus trichocarpa], and grape [Vitis vinifera]), we detected hundreds  of CNSs upstream of Arabidopsis genes. Distinct positioning, length, and  enrichment for transcription factor binding sites suggest these CNSs play a  functional role in transcriptional regulation. The enrichment of transcription  factors within the set of genes associated with CNS is consistent with the  hypothesis that together they form part of a conserved transcriptional network whose function is to regulate other transcription factors and control  development. We identified a set of promoters where regulatory mechanisms are  likely to be shared between the model organism Arabidopsis and other dicots, providing areas of focus for further research, Context: transcriptional process, progressively increased at GAD1 and other GABAergic  gene promoters (GAD2, NPY, SST) in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) from prenatal  to peripubertal ages and throughout adulthood. Alterations in schizophrenia  included decreased GAD1 expression and H3K4-trimethylation, predominantly in  females and in conjunction with a risk haplotype at the 5' end of GAD1.  Heterozygosity for a truncated, lacZ knock-in allele of mixed-lineage leukemia 1  (Mll1), a histone methyltransferase expressed in GABAergic and other cortical  neurons, resulted in decreased H3K4 methylation at GABAergic gene promoters. In  contrast, Gad1 H3K4 (tri)methylation and Mll1 occupancy was increased in cerebral cortex of mice after treatment with the atypical antipsychotic,  clozapine. These effects were not mimicked by haloperidol or genetic ablation of  dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, suggesting that blockade of D2-like signaling is not sufficient for clozapine-induced histone methylation.

In contrast, AS induced a transient increase of this  mark in control mice. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP)  method to isolate CA3 translating mRNAs, we found that expression of genes of  the epigenetic gene family, GABA/glutamate family, and glucocorticoid receptors  binding genes were decreased transiently in control mice by AS and showed a persistent reduction in ELS mice. In most cases, AS in ELS mice did not induce  gene expression changes. A stringent filtering of genes affected by AS in  control and ELS mice revealed a noteworthy decrease in gene expression change in ELS mice compared to control.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that ""cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules"" and describes these granules as ""cy","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist  longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular  change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state, Context: Importin-beta family members, which shuttle between the nucleus and the  cytoplasm, are essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. We  attempted to explore whether importin-beta family proteins change their cellular  localization in response to environmental change. In this report, we show that  transportin (TRN) was minimally detected in cytoplasmic processing bodies  (P-bodies) under normal cell conditions but largely translocated to stress  granules (SGs) in stressed cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  analysis indicated that TRN moves rapidly in and out of cytoplasmic granules.  Depletion of TRN greatly enhanced P-body formation but did not affect the number or size of SGs, suggesting that TRN or its cargo(es) participates in cellular  function of P-bodies. Accordingly, TRN associated with tristetraprolin (TTP) and  its AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNA substrates. Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with  knockdown of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1. Moreover, depletion of TRN retained TTP  in P-bodies and meanwhile reduced the fraction of mobile TTP to SGs.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.

AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy, Context:  Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur.

The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats, Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression","30352242, 24205431, 16964766, 24211676, 22383310",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bimagrumab on skeletal muscle mass and  function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and  reduced skeletal muscle mass. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with COPD (mean FEV1, 1.05 L [41.6% predicted];  aged 40-80 yr; body mass index < 20 kg/m2 or appendicular skeletal muscle mass  index ≤ 7.25 [men] and ≤ 5.67 [women] kg/m2), received two doses of either, Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab  is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes,  pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal functions were evaluated with basal hormone measurement and  standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests at baseline, Week 8 and at the end of study (EOS)-Week  20. RESULTS: At Week 8, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were reduced by  42.16 IU/L (P < .001) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased by 2.5, Context: increased expression associated with more aggressive cancer, as well as acquired  resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKI). MET inhibitors act via two basic mechanisms. Small molecule inhibitors  antagonize ATP in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MET, with studies  on the following agents reviewed here: tivantinib (ARQ-197), cabozantinib  (XL-184), crizotinib (PF-02341066), amuvatinib (MP470), MGCD265, foretinib  (EXEL-2880), MK2461, SGX523, PHA665752, JNJ-38877605, SU11274, and K252A. The  monoclonal monovalent antibody fragment onartuzumab (MetMAb) is also discussed  here, which binds to and prevents the extracellular activation of the receptor by ligand. MET inhibition may both overcome the negative prognostic effect of  MET tumor expression as well as antagonize MET-dependent acquired resistance to  EGFR inhibitors. Here we discuss MET inhibitors in combination with other therapies in lung cancer, Context: comorbidity. This drug has been studied in five phase 3 clinical trials, four  discussed herein: semaglutide produces roughly twice as much weight loss as we  have seen in older antiobesity medications. Semaglutide is already in use for  treatment of diabetes and, as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor analog,  is part of a class of drugs used widely in diabetes. Tirzepatide, a  glucose-insulin peptide and GLP-1 dual agonist is in phase 3 study for obesity  management, and bimagrumab is a new agent in phase 2 with a unique mechanism of  action; they are generating much interest. The purpose of this narrative review  is lay the groundwork for a discussion of the clinical impact of these new medications on the clinical practice of obesity. Further, these developments  shall be used to launch a speculation of what is likely to be their impact on  the future of obesity pharmacotherapy, Context: pre-cast levels at 12 weeks.

Characterizing reactive intermediates will provide information on  the structure of reactive species, thereby defining a potential bioactivation  mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable. However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily, Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity, Context: The decline in approval of new drugs during the past decade has led to a close  analysis of the drug discovery process. One of the main reasons for attrition is  preclinical toxicity, frequently attributed to the generation of  protein-reactive drug metabolites. In this review, we present a critique of such  reactive metabolites and evaluate the evidence linking them to observed toxic  effects. Methodology for the characterization of reactive metabolites has advanced greatly in recent years, and is summarized first. Next, we consider the  inhibition of key metabolic enzymes by electrophilic metabolites, as well as  unfavorable drug-drug interactions that may ensue. One important class of protein-reactive metabolites, not linked conclusively to a toxic event, is acyl  glucuronides. Their properties are discussed in light of the safety  characteristics of carboxylic acid containing drugs. Many adverse drug reactions, Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.

In the presence of complex axonal neuropathy, other features of this condition should  be sought, Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of, Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this  patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a  genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation, Context: The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the  syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and  molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis. In one patient with isolated achalasia, the diagnosis of triple A syndrome could only be made on the basis of  the molecular genetic analysis of the AAAS gene. We therefore suggest that the  diagnosis of triple A syndrome should be considered in patients who exhibit only one or two of the main symptoms (i.e. alacrima, achalasia or adrenal  insufficiency). These patients require careful neurological investigation, and  mutation analysis of the AAAS gene should be performed, Context: change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported","22000320, 20200814, 18551317, 12752575, 29255950","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes, according to the context, low-dose CEP-26401 had some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters in clinical trials. However, further studies are required to establish its potential in cognition enhancement.","Context: with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose  CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement, Context:  CEP-26401 is a novel orally active, brain-penetrant, high-affinity histamine H3  receptor (H3R) antagonist, with potential therapeutic utility in cognition  enhancement. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was, Context: mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: as a modulator of neurotransmitter release and its effects on cognitive  processes, as well as to provide an update on selected H3 antagonists in various  states of preclinical and clinical advancement. Blockade of centrally localized  H3 receptors by selective H3 receptor antagonists has been shown to enhance the  release of neurotransmitters such as histamine, ACh, dopamine and  norepinephrine, among others, which play important roles in cognitive processes.  The cognitive-enhancing effects of H3 antagonists across multiple cognitive  domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also bolster confidence  in this therapeutic approach for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, although  a number of clinical studies examining the efficacy of H3 receptor antagonists  for a variety of cognitive disorders are currently underway, no clinical proof of concept for an H3 receptor antagonist has been reported to date.

Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, the context provides information about the organs affected by SLE. The organs most commonly involved in SLE are the skin, blood cells, joints, and kidneys. However, it can affect any organ or system of the body","Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune  connective-tissue disease involving multiple organs and systems. Some evidence  has demonstrated that disease activity could be associated with increased risk  of organ damage. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association between  systemic lupus erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores and  subclinical cardiac involvement. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 45 SLE patients (88%  female; mean age: 31.2 ± 8.2 years) from 2011 to 2013 in Mashhad, Iran. The  patients had no clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac problems or risk factors, Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve any number of organ  systems and varies greatly in the severity and type of involvement. Cutaneous  manifestations of SLE are equally numerous and varied throughout the course of the disease within an individual, as well as varying between patients. Cutaneous  manifestations of SLE are frequently the presenting symptoms, typically noted in  the classic malar ""butterfly"" rash; however, other cutaneous patterns are frequently observed. METHODS: We present here two patients who presented with what was thought to be  acne refractory to treatment. RESULTS: These patients actually were found to have a facial eruption associated  with SLE as confirmed by skin biopsy, Context:  OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease  characterized by unpredictable flares of disease activity and irreversible  damage to multiple organ systems. An earlier study showed that SLE patients carrying an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature in blood have elevated  serum levels of IFN-regulated chemokines. These chemokines were associated with  more-severe and active disease and showed promise as SLE disease activity biomarkers. This study was designed to validate IFN-regulated chemokines as  biomarkers of SLE disease activity in 267 SLE patients followed up  longitudinally. METHODS: To validate the potential utility of serum chemokine levels as, Context: In view of documented evidence that catechol estrogen-DNA adducts serve as  epitopes for binding of anti-nuclear antibodies, genetic polymorphisms of the  xenobiotic metabolic pathway involved in estrogen metabolism might contribute  towards pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To test this  hypothesis, a case-control study was conducted.
