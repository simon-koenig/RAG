What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it plays a role in tumorigenesis, particularly in Group 3 and 4 tumors. High levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can  cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.  Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of H3K27M-driven tumorigenesis has recently  led to the identification of some potential therapeutic targets in diffuse  intrinsic pontine glioma. In this chapter, we will review and summarize recent  studies on the H3K27M-driven tumorigenic mechanisms and properties and the role  of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones in brain tumors","23179372, 23179372, 33155136","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

Describe RIblast,"The protocol for rapid, inexpensive extraction of high-molecular-weight gDNA from bacteria, plants, and animals is referred to as RIBlast. It involves a series of steps including cell lysis, DNA precipitation, and purification using a combination of commercial","Context: De novo sequencing of complex genomes is one of the main challenges for  researchers seeking high-quality reference sequences. Many de novo assemblies  are based on short reads, producing fragmented genome sequences.  Third-generation sequencing, with read lengths >10 kb, will improve the assembly  of complex genomes, but these techniques require high-molecular-weight genomic  DNA (gDNA), and gDNA extraction protocols used for obtaining smaller fragments for short-read sequencing are not suitable for this purpose. Methods of  preparing gDNA for bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries could be  adapted, but these approaches are time-consuming, and commercial kits for these methods are expensive. Here, we present a protocol for rapid, inexpensive  extraction of high-molecular-weight gDNA from bacteria, plants, and animals. Our  technique was validated using sunflower leaf samples, producing a mean read, Context:  Genome sequencing has been democratized by second-generation technologies, and  even small labs can sequence metazoan genomes now. In this article, we describe  '959 Nematode Genomes'--a community-curated semantic wiki to coordinate the sequencing efforts of individual labs to collectively sequence 959 genomes  spanning the phylum Nematoda. The main goal of the wiki is to track sequencing  projects that have been proposed, are in progress, or have been completed. Wiki pages for species and strains are linked to pages for people and organizations,  using machine- and human-readable metadata that users can query to see the  status of their favourite worm. The site is based on the same platform that runs, Context:  The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized the  study of genetic variation in the human genome. Whole-genome sequencing  currently represents the most comprehensive strategy for variant detection genome-wide but is costly for large sample sizes, and variants detected in  noncoding regions remain largely uninterpretable. By contrast, whole-exome  sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo  mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders. Since whole-exome sequencing focuses  upon the entire set of exons in the genome (the exome), it requires additional","27712583, 22058131, 22468815","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58â€‰000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"PINES enables analyses to be customized towards genomic annotations from cell types of the highest relevance given the phenotype of interest. However, for your question about visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes, I don't know the answer as it is not","Context: Functional characterization of the noncoding genome is essential for biological  understanding of gene regulation and disease. Here, we introduce the  computational framework PINES (Phenotype-Informed Noncoding Element Scoring),  which predicts the functional impact of noncoding variants by integrating  epigenetic annotations in a phenotype-dependent manner. PINES enables analyses  to be customized towards genomic annotations from cell types of the highest relevance given the phenotype of interest. We illustrate that PINES identifies  functional noncoding variation more accurately than methods that do not use  phenotype-weighted knowledge, while at the same time being flexible and easy to use via a dedicated web portal, Context: and annotation information from several eukaryotic species. A user can  additionally import their own custom sequence and annotation data. Individual  annotation objects are displayed in Sockeye by using custom 3D models.  Ensembl-derived and imported sequences can be analyzed by using a suite of  multiple and pair-wise alignment algorithms. The results of these comparative  analyses are also displayed in the 3D environment of Sockeye. By using the  Java3D API to visualize genomic data in a 3D environment, we are able to  compactly display cross-sequence comparisons. This provides the user with a  novel platform for visualizing and comparing genomic feature organization, Context: BACKGROUND: Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have  emerged as a tool for enabling targeted gene editing and disruption in difficult  systems, such as human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The modular architecture  of TAL effectors theoretically enables targeting of any genomic locus and  several cloning systems for custom TALEN assembly have recently been  established. However, there is a lack of versatile TALEN expression systems  applicable to hPSCs. RESULTS: Here, we extend an existing TALE assembly system by a dual set of  expression vectors for efficient application of TALEN technology in hPSCs. This  is characterized by improved TALEN architecture as well as antibiotic resistance and fluorescent reporter cassettes, thus enabling enrichment for transfected  cells. Improved functionality of the combined system was demonstrated by  targeted disruption of the HPRT1 gene to create isogenic disease models of","30359302, 15123592, 24206569","Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,Monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1) is mediated by PR-Set7.,"Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale.

Taken together, these findings suggest that emodin mediated oxidative  injury (DNA damage) based on ROS production and ER stress based on the levels of  GADD153 and GRP78 that acts as an early and upstream change in the cell death  cascade to caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways, triggers  mitochondrial dysfunction from Bcl-2 and Bax modulation, mitochondrial  cytochrome c release and caspase activation, consequently leading to apoptosis  in SCC-4 cells, Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-Î± plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to  mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells.  Dysfunction of apoptosis renders the cancer cell resistant to treatment as well  as promotes tumorigenesis. Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane  permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c and consequently cancer cell death. A number of drugs in clinical use are  known to indirectly activate Bax. Intriguingly, recent efforts demonstrate that  Bax can serve as a promising direct target for small-molecule drug discovery. Several direct Bax activators have been identified to hold promise for cancer  therapy with the advantages of specificity and the potential of overcoming  chemo- and radioresistance.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes. It is upregulated in some tumors, specifically bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues.","Context: Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder  cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize. SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell  migration.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,IL-17 receptor.   Brodalumab blocks its receptor.,"Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab  neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical  trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The  biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials  was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible  differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A  ligand, Context: This article discusses the scientific rationale for the use of cytokine  inhibitors, including ustekinumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin (IL)-12 and  IL-23 pathways in psoriasis. Also addressed are the efficacy and safety data for  this agent, as well as for several emerging therapies that target other cytokine  pathways in psoriasis: the IL-17 inhibitors secukinumab, ixekizumab, and  brodalumab, the IL-23 blocker tildrakizumab, and the small-molecule kinase inhibitors apremilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 blocker) and tofacitinib (a Janus  kinase inhibitor), Context: siltuximab, and ramucirumab, as well as the Fc fusion proteins Factor IX-Fc and  Factor VIII-Fc; and the submission of first marketing applications for up to  five therapeutics (secukinumab, ch14.18, onartuzumab, necitumumab, gevokizumab).

We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase,  imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension and other indications.,"Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications, Context: concerning isradipine included the initial dose and its interval, subsequent  dose escalations, blood pressure response to the medication, and duration of  therapy. RESULTS: The study population comprised 12 patients, ranging in age from 10 days  to 11 years. The etiology of the hypertension was renal in 9 cases and nonrenal  in 3. Initial dosing with isradipine was 0.1 mg/kg/dose. Six patients had  emergent hypertension, and their blood pressure had been controlled with  intravenous nicardipine before oral isradipine. Six patients received initial  therapy with oral isradipine. Isradipine was monotherapy in 7 patients and in  combination with other agents in 5 patients. The dose of isradipine required for blood pressure control was 0.6 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/day (range, 0.3 to 1.2 mg/kg/day).  Isradipine failed to provide effective blood pressure control in 2 patients. In  1 of these patients, isradipine was effective after peritoneal dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an effective, orally administered agent for control  of hypertension in children, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair, but it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to carcinogenesis.","Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a neoplasm for which the  prevalence and mortality rates are very high in Taiwan. The DNA non-homologous  end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA  double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous  DNA-damaging agents. Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic  instability and carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the contribution of variant XRCC6 in relation to the risk of HCC, from the levels of DNA, RNA and  protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, we collected  298 patients with HCC and 298 cancer-free controls, with frequency matched by age and gender. Firstly, the associations of XRCC6 promoter T-991C (rs5751129),  promoter G-57C (rs2267437), promoter A-31G (rs132770), and intron-3 (rs132774)  polymorphisms with HCC risk in this Taiwanese population were evaluated, Context: changes giving rise to larger CNVs such as acquired somatic copy number  aberrations (CNAs) promoting cancer formation. Previous studies provided  evidence for CNVs as an underlying cause of elevated breast cancer risk when  targeting breast cancer susceptibility genes and of accelerated breast cancer  progression when targeting oncogenes. With the development of novel techniques  for genome-wide detection of CNVs at increasingly higher resolution, it became  possible to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse manifestation of DNA damage  resulting from defects in any of the large variety of DNA double-strand break  (DSB) repair mechanisms. Breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases, has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway,  which in turn switches damage removal towards alternative, more error-prone DSB  repair pathways such as microhomology-mediated non-homologous end joining (mmNHEJ). Indeed, increased error-prone DSB repair activities were detected in  peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with familial breast cancer risk  independently of specific gene mutations.

What is known about the effect of acupuncture in smoking cessation ?,The study found that ear acupuncture has a reliable therapeutic effect for smoking cessation. It yielded a one-year success rate of 41.1%. The treatment was also found to be economical and without side effects.,"Context: BACKGROUND: Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease  worldwide but smokers often fail to quit due to nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  Current available pharmaceutical therapies may assist with smoking cessation but  may have side effects. Ear acupressure (EAP) and ear acupuncture have been used  for smoking cessation, and some positive results have been reported. The aim of  the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EAP in assisting individuals to quit smoking and/or support them in the management of nicotine withdrawal  symptoms. METHODS: This study will be a randomised, single-blind, sham-controlled study  conducted at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes. The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and vector-mediated genotoxicity, but they have been used in gene therapy studies in preclinical models and clinical trials.","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid  [G.

Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in  gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), particularly in immunosuppressed recipient hosts. However,  in the latest packaging cell lines and vectors, the risk of RCR-generation has  been drastically reduced, primarily by minimizing the homologous overlap between","21247248, 16717285, 14683449","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. They mostly arise by point mutations in known protein-coding genes.,"Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Cytoplasm. Stress granules are composed largely of stalled preinitiation complexes, and contain mRNA, small ribosomal subunits, eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP, as their core components","Context: The packaging of cytoplasmic mRNA into discrete RNA granules regulates gene  expression by delaying the translation of specific transcripts. Specialized RNA  granules found in germ cells direct the timing of maternal mRNA translation to  promote germ cell development in the early embryo and establish the germ line  for the next generation. Similarly, select neuronal mRNA transcripts are  packaged into translationally inert RNA granules, transported to sites where  their protein products are required, and only then activated and translated.  Following translation, however, newly inactivated mRNAs released from polysomes  can also be packaged into dynamic, transient structures known as stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs). Stress granules are composed largely of  stalled preinitiation complexes, and contain mRNA, small ribosomal subunits,  eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP, as their core components. PBs are associated with mRNA decay and contain the decapping enzymes DCP1/2, the 5' to 3' exonuclease  Xrn1, the Lsm proteins (1-7), and the scaffolding proteins hedls/GE-1 and GW182.  Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and, Context: mRNA is subsequently degraded. In eukaryotes, Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) and Hbs1  are responsible for solving general problems of ribosomal stall in translation.  In archaea, aPelota and aEF1Î±, homologous to Pelota and Hbs1, respectively, are  considered to be involved in that process. In recent years, great progress has  been made in determining structures of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1Î±. In this  review, we focus on the functional roles of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1Î± in  ribosome rescue, based on recent structural studies of them. We will also  present questions to be answered by future work, Context: NS4B and NS5A proteins, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. NS4B is a  master organizer of replication complex formation while NS5A is a  zinc-containing phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of HCV RNA replication  versus particle production. Core to NS2 make up the assembly module while NS3 to  NS5B represent the replication module (replicase). However, HCV proteins exert  multiple functions during the viral life cycle, and these may be governed by  different structural conformations and/or interactions with viral and/or  cellular partners. Remarkably, each viral protein is anchored to intracellular  membranes via specific determinants that are essential to protein function in the cell. This review summarizes current knowledge of the structure and function  of the HCV proteins and highlights recent advances in the field","17923231, 27493551, 23463199",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context mentions that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context:  Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,Hypothyroidism has been linked with low-grade inflammation in heart failure patients.,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in thyroid function are frequent in patients with  heart failure and are associated with increased mortality. However, the relation  between thyroid hormone levels and echocardiographic parameters has not been investigated sufficiently. AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlations of thyroid  hormone levels with echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate their  associations with subsequent mortality in a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 111 consecutive  patients with DCMP (35 female, 76 male, mean age: 62+/-12 years). All patients, Context: involve influences on calcium flux, with thyroid hormone promoting expression of  the gene encoding the calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCa2). In  contrast, in hypothyroid animals phospholamban levels, which inhibit the SERCa2  pump, are increased. In addition, marked effects are exerted on the calcium  channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum the ryanodine channel. Related to  myofibrillar proteins, myosin heavy chain alpha is increased by T3 and MHC beta  is decreased. Complex and interesting interactions occur between cardiac  hypertrophy induced by excess thyroid hormone action and cardiac hypertrophy  occurring with heart failure. The thyroid hormone mediated cardiac hypertrophy in its initial phases presents a physiological hypertrophy with increases in  SERCa2 levels and decreased expression of MHC beta. In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart, Context:  Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates various metabolic pathways and the hepatic  actions of T3 are mediated primarily through the thyroid hormone receptor beta  (TRÎ²). Hypothyroidism has been linked with low grade inflammation, elevated risk of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are  associated with inflammation, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Due to  potential linkage between thyroid hormone and sPLA2, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormone status on the regulation of secretory phospholipases in mice,  rats and human liver. T3 suppressed the expression of the sPLA2 group IIa  (PLA2g2a) gene in the liver of BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 transgenic mice","15642542, 19125327, 24440706",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes.

We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-Î± gene  expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological  function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured, Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,Activin type II receptors (ActRII).,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75Â years, received bimagrumab, Context: (ACTH) stimulation tests at baseline, Week 8 and at the end of study (EOS)-Week  20. RESULTS: At Week 8, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were reduced by  42.16 IU/L (PÂ <Â .001) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased by 2.5  IU/L (PÂ =Â .08) over placebo in response to bimagrumab in women but not in men.  Effects that were reversible after bimagrumab was cleared. Gonadal and adrenal  androgen levels were not affected by exposure to bimagrumab.  CONCLUSION: Bimagrumab alters the function of pituitary gonadotroph cells,  consistent with blockade of activin on local ActRII. This effect is reversible  with clearance of bimagrumab.
