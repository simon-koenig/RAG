What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it plays a role in tumorigenesis. Specifically, high levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) were found in","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation, Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations  that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent  mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1  (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly  affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich  repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone  methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for  histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in  multiple cohorts of HCC","23179372, 14688019, 14688019, 23728943","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. These lncRNAs were identified as being regulated by Sam68 in the context of adipogenesis.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes.

RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks. Seven mRNAs (ANKRD34A, FMODA, GJA3, CNTN5, BMP10, BAI2  and HS3ST6) were involved in both networks of LNC_00035 and LNC_000466.

The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD","29137239, 29137239, 29228702, 34608503","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
Describe RIblast,I don't know the answer.,"Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized  by the presence of nucleic acid- and protein-targeting autoantibodies and an  aberrant type I IFN expression signature. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an  autosomal-recessive encephalopathy in children that is characterized by  mutations in numerous nucleic acid repair enzymes and elevated IFN levels.  Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads, Context: determine masses of both 30S subunits and intact 2.3 MDa 70S ribosomes from  Thermus thermophilus. The masses of both particles are consistent with multiple  populations of ribosomes. To identify these various populations we combine  simulated mass spectra of ribosomes, with and without the full protein  complement, and estimate the extent of adducts from our study of known  complexes. The results allow us to determine the contribution of the different  subpopulations to the overall mass spectrum. We confirm the existence of these  subpopulations using tandem mass spectrometry of intact 30S subunits. Overall,  the results show that, rather than uniform particles, gas-phase ribosomes consist of a number of discrete populations. More generally, the results  establish a rigorous procedure for accurate mass measurement and spectral  analysis of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies, Context: BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, pure red blood cell aplasia of  childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors. About 40% of  patients display various malformations. Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment  in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell  transplantation. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19,  are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than  25% of cases. Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of  patients show that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis.  Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of  patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding  sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia who were negative for  RPS19 mutations. RESULTS: About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and  only 1.6% in RPS24. All but three mutations that we report here are new","22544737, 25500879, 16939266, 19773262","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942
Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This is achieved through fluorescence in situ hybrid","Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This unit details how Oligopaint probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: A host of observations demonstrating the relationship between nuclear  architecture and processes such as gene expression have led to a number of new  technologies for interrogating chromosome positioning. Whereas some of these  technologies reconstruct intermolecular interactions, others have enhanced our  ability to visualize chromosomes in situ. Here, we describe an oligonucleotide-  and PCR-based strategy for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform that enables this technology to be extended to any  organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are  renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers  precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and  multicolor imaging of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with, Context: This work is concerned with more complex geometric properties, i.e., the  complete shape formed by genomic regions. Our work is based on statistical shape  theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures,  e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution,  and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions. We found that geometric normalization  with respect to the nucleus shape based on non-rigid image registration has a, Context: Inherited Disease Panel.

The most likely disease-causing variants were analyzed by  Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The PGM sequencing has yielded an output of 855.80 Mb, with a > 100 ×  median sequencing depth and a coverage of > 98% for the targeted regions in all the four samples. After data analysis and database filtering, one known missense  mutation (p.E1811K) and two novel premature termination mutations (p.E2264X and  p.L871FfsX23) in the FBN1 gene were identified in the three MFS patients.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By  generating a modification-specific antibody and yeast strains that harbor  mutations in the putative site of methylation, we provide evidence that this  mark exist in vivo. Importantly, we show that this lysine residue is highly  conserved through evolution, and provide evidence that this methylation event  also occurs in higher eukaryotes. By identifying a novel site of histone methylation, this study adds to our overall understanding of the complex number  of histone modifications that contribute to chromatin function, Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions, Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes","23355544, 21249157, 24681537, 19687145",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

These data provide the  rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis. FUNDING: Merck KGaA, and Pfizer Inc, Context: unchanged for the last 20-30 years. Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and  its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown  promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and  PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could  potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical  efficacy","29784744, 28982750, 29217288, 29540084","Yes, avelumab is effective treatment of bladder cancer.","29103968, 29606979, 29784744, 29644490, 28864844, 28493171, 29540084, 29069302, 28214651, 29416316, 28982750"
HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,The epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors.,"Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of, Context: A novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of  beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with  architecture obeying those proteins' construction principles. The HMM is trained  and tested on a non-redundant set of 11 beta-barrel membrane proteins known to  date at atomic resolution with a jack-knife procedure. As a result, the method  correctly locates 97% of 172 transmembrane beta-strands. Out of the 11 proteins, the barrel size for ten proteins and the overall topology for seven proteins are  correctly predicted. Additionally, it successfully assigns the entire topology  for two new beta-barrel membrane proteins that have no significant sequence homology to the 11 proteins. Predicted topology for two candidates for  beta-barrel structure of the outer mitochondrial membrane is also presented in  the paper","16800251, 9744863, 11694782, 12798041",Her-2 belongs to the family of the human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs).,"16707458, 26545934, 15173008, 27993109, 30312728, 15920544, 21896992, 33202212, 11785652, 17536308, 15782071, 11694782, 22505536, 17867585, 12767812, 25620423, 27426127, 30384340, 10480346, 11180765, 19048033, 7612897, 21805036, 19279475, 29389942, 16800251, 18505086"
Which company developed eptinezumab?,Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals.,"Context: Eptinezumab-jjmr (referred to as eptinezumab hereafter; Vyepti™) is a humanised  monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and  blocks its binding to the receptor. CGRP is believed to play a major role in the  pathophysiology of migraine. Eptinezumab, delivered by intravenous (IV)  administration, is being developed by Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals for  the prevention of migraine. In February 2020, eptinezumab was approved in the USA for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. This article summarizes  the milestones in the development of eptinezumab leading to this first approval, Context:  TNF blockers have been available to treat various inflammatory disorders since  more than a decade. T cells and macrophages mainly express TNF and activate many  cells through two types of receptors. Pharmaceutical companies developed two types of TNF blockers: soluble receptors and monoclonal antibodies.  Understanding of differences of structure and function can explain divergence of  efficacy or side effects. Etanercept has the best retention rate in rheumatic diseases, but is less or not effective in granulomatous diseases, such as  inflammatory bowel diseases or uveitis. However, etanercept induces less  tuberculosis infections than anti-TNF blocker monoclonal antibodies, Context: considerable proportion of patients are refractory to treatment, highlighting an  unmet medical need for new therapies. Molecules that direct the trafficking of  inflammatory cells, such as the α4β7 integrin, are attractive targets for new  drug candidates. The α4β7 integrin is involved in lymphocyte recruitment to the  normal and inflamed gut mucosa, and the lymphoid tissue. The pan-α4 integrin  neutralizing mAb, natalizumab, is not gut-selective but has demonstrated  efficacy in IBD. However, treatment was associated with the occurrence of  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has limited its use,  especially in Europe. Vedolizumab (MNL-0002), Millennium Pharmaceutical's gut-specific, α4β7 integrin-neutralizing mAb, does not affect peripheral blood  cell counts and appears to lack systemic effects. Data from phase II clinical  trials of vedolizumab demonstrated efficacy with an attractive safety profile, especially in ulcerative colitis.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that CsA (cyclosporin A) totally prevented cytochrome c release when apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells, indicating that Bax can indeed trigger","Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes. In the provided contexts, it is mentioned that MALAT-1 expression is upregulated in some tumors, including bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and primary tumors that subsequently metastasized.","Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique  loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of  splicing or gene expression. In lung cancer, MALAT1 does not alter alternative, Context:  INTRODUCTION: The functions of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have remained  elusive in many cases. Metastasis-Associated-in-Lung-Adenocarcinoma-Transcript-1  (MALAT-1) is an ncRNA that is highly expressed in several tumor types. METHODS: Overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches were used for the  analysis of the biological functions of MALAT-1 RNA. Tumor growth was studied in  nude mice. For prognostic analysis, MALAT-1 RNA was detected on paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue probes (n = 352)  using in situ hybridization.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that most RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance due to mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene, and that mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,IL-17 receptor A.,"Context: patients with atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Available systemic drugs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  are limited. There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen.  Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment  of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2)  allergic inflammation are promising. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody  to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published  efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. A number  of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in  atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin).  Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval  of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis.  Antifungals may be helpful in the variant of head and neck dermatitis associated, Context: Targeted therapies are widely used in cancer because of their effectiveness,  even in tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy such as kidney  or hepatocellular carcinomas. There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib. Inhibitors of KIT, a membrane receptor, are mainly represented by imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Finally, mTOR  inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are  temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus, Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,Telomerase.   Imetelstat specifically inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity.,"Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA.

It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids.

FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy). DNA analysis was based on EcoRI/BlnI restriction enzyme digestion  followed by hybridization with P13E-11 molecular probe. In our material, we have, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent adult  muscular dystrophies. The common clinical signs usually appear during the second  decade of life but when the first molecular dysregulations occur is still unknown. Our aim was to determine whether molecular dysregulations can be  identified during FSHD fetal muscle development. We compared muscle biopsies  derived from FSHD1 fetuses and the cells derived from some of these biopsies with biopsies and cells derived from control fetuses. We mainly focus on DUX4  isoform expression because the expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both  FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. In the first context, total LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.","Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension and stroke prevention. Isradipine reduces infarct size caused by embolic stroke in rats.,"Context: The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion  of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood, Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg.

Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) is inhibited by LB-100.,"Context: The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB100, has been shown in  pre-clinical studies to be an effective chemo- and radio-sensitizer for  treatment of various cancers. We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines.

Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo.

This CNN architecture, combined with schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited data, enables","Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively.

One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site. No matches to the Berget  consensus sequence are located near this second, weaker polyA site, Context: all of the mutant RNA is cleaved and polyadenylated at heterogeneous sites  approximately 100 nt upstream of the wild-type early polyadenylation site. In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites. These experiments indicate that inactivation of the major early polyadenylation signal is not sufficient to induce expression  of the BPV late genes in transformed mouse cells, Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals.

Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized.

In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content, Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF  expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells, Context: treated with 50 μM roscovitine to induce apoptosis. 6 h after roscovitine  treatment, cells were labeled with annexin V-Oregon green, harvested by  scraping, and labeled with PI.

We found that neural  progenitors depend increasingly on Bmi-1 for proliferation as development  proceeds from embryonic through adult stages. Acute shRNA-mediated Bmi-1  reduction causes defects in embryonic and adult NSC proliferation and  self-renewal that, unexpectedly, are mediated by a different cell-cycle  inhibitor, p21. Gene array analyses revealed developmental differences in  Bmi-1-controlled expression of genes in the p21-Rb cell cycle regulatory  pathway.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements, which may play a role in carcinogenesis.","Context: expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis, Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,Beta-Kaps are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs.,"Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities. We present a  model in which an alpha-independent beta-Kap progenitor gave rise to the  alpha-dependent beta-Kaps and the alpha-Kaps, Context: the use of adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the standard treatment for these  tumors, although several studies have documented that the current standard  combination chemotherapy is suboptimal. Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations, Context: the merozoite, present either in the apical region (A-type) or in the cytosol  (B-type). The presence of RIFINs in merozoites suggests that antigenic variation  in P. falciparum is not only restricted to parasite-derived proteins at the IE  surface, but the phenomenon also prevails in other life cycle stages.  Interestingly, some RIFIN variants were detected only in intracellular stages  and not in merozoites, pointing to differential developmental expression  patterns for distinct members of this large protein family, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3.

Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at  all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0  mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50  h following the first infusion, and 124 h following the fourth infusion. In  summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that  supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity. Future efforts with  lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy, Context: Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of  CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC). We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled  on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and  lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean  duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at  all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0  mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50, Context: The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial  pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated  with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and  bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab  was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have  previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,  preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the  binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques,  we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP  domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189, Context: Ibalizumab is a humanized, anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. It potently blocks  HIV-1 infection and targets an epitope in the second domain of CD4 without  interfering with immune functions mediated by interaction of CD4 with major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. We report here the crystal  structure of ibalizumab Fab fragment in complex with the first two domains  (D1-D2) of CD4 at 2.2 Å resolution. Ibalizumab grips CD4 primarily by the BC-loop (residues 121-125) of D2, sitting on the opposite side of gp120 and  MHC-II binding sites. No major conformational change in CD4 accompanies binding  to ibalizumab. Both monovalent and bivalent forms of ibalizumab effectively block viral infection, suggesting that it does not need to crosslink CD4 to  exert antiviral activity.

CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate  that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD, Context: impact on the understanding of the nature of constitutional factors making  individuals vulnerable for e.g. substance abuse and the link between low  platelet MAO activity and type 2 alcoholism, recently confirmed on non-human  primates, is discussed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the association  between platelet MAO and behaviour are discussed and evidence that common  transcriptional factors, e.g. within the AP-2 family, regulating both the  expression of platelet MAO and components of central monoaminergic systems, such  as synthetizing enzymes, receptors and transporters, are presented. A hypothesis  is put forward, that such common transcription factors may not directly regulate platelet MAO expression, but rather mitochondrial number or outer membrane  surface, Context: Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The context mentions that the therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and vector-mediated genotoxicity.,"Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase  cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the mouse  enzyme was found to be transferred to human cells at high efficiency. Enzyme","21247248, 14683449, 24158830, 10757351","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production. Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated.","24120896, 16251873, 12686720, 23921576, 15912200, 23843498, 23884859, 19435468, 23845071, 23860311, 23845947, 23845948, 21943326"
Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No.   Tumour-specific antigens mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.","Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous.

Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?,"The package is called ""copynumber"".","Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: epigenomic marker. Our empirical analysis shows that the method yields  reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional  important changes in histone modifications. To further explore the broader  applicability of MMDiff, we apply it to two ENCODE data sets: one investigating  the histone modification H3K27ac and one measuring the genome-wide binding of  the transcription factor CTCF. In both cases, MMDiff proves to be complementary  to count-based methods. In addition, we can show that MMDiff is capable of  directly detecting changes of homotypic binding events at neighbouring binding  sites. MMDiff is readily available as a Bioconductor package. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that higher order features of ChIP-Seq  peaks carry relevant and often complementary information to total counts, and  hence are important in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding. We have developed a new computational method,  MMDiff, that is capable of exploring these features and therefore closes an  existing gap in the analysis of ChIP-Seq data sets, Context: sources. Results have shown that our approach consistently outperforms other two  state of the art programs.

It works by binding to CD19 on B-cells, leading to cell activation and subsequent killing of cancer cells through a process called apoptosis. The mechanism","Context: CAR T-cells have transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with  relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Currently, three CAR T-cell  products are approved or soon to be approved: axicabtagene ciloleucel,  tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel. These products differ in  construct, manufacturing, clinical trial design and toxicity profile. Patient  selection for CAR T-cells, and the ideal product for a given patient, involves myriad considerations including age, fitness, prior therapies, comorbid  diseases, organ function, logistics of administration, turnaround time, and  institutional familiarity. This article reviews the proper patient and product selection for the management of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive  B-cell lymphomas, Context:  It has been established that the urothelial mucin layer functions as a bacterial  anti-adherence factor. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat  patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an  immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to  determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to  demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder  urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours,, Context: April 2016, there were no licensed drugs available in the United States of  America (USA) for the treatment of PD psychosis (PDP). Pimavanserin is the first  Food and Drug Administration approved medicine for the treatment of  hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.   This enzyme binds to the liver LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling.,"Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site, Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus  formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and  adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not","14747475, 24661068, 8798387, 23376345",Evolocumab (AMG145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that demonstrated marked reductions in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in statin-intolerant patients.,"24859266, 24694531, 24662398, 24691094, 25470376, 24825642, 24953393, 25079474, 24953396, 25002170, 24678979, 24598985, 24661068, 24477778, 24481874, 24255061, 25282519, 25282520, 24509273, 25052769, 24284914, 24373748, 24961142, 25410046"
List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1.","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization","12032775, 16888367, 21632975, 28161276","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,The stress granules localize in the cytoplasm.,"Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. PCOS  model rats were established by dehydroepiandrosterone injection.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Familial Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th  and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three  females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces. Proband 5 also had a brain tumor (ganglioglioma) at  the age of 3 years.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context mentions that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes.

Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains, Context: Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity.

AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy, Context:  Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. Hesperidin was shown to protect cultured cells against A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage and attenuate excitotoxic neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in cortical cultures.,"Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line, Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals.

The  purpose of this study was to assess whether PGI(2) analogues could affect T  helper (Th) cell responses in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy  donors (HD). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33  patients with SSc and 29 HD. Cytokine levels in PBMC and monocyte/CD4 T cell  cultures were quantified by immunoassays. The frequencies of interleukin  (IL)-17A, IL-22, interferon γ (IFNγ) and IL-4-producing CD4 T cells were  assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Selective receptor antagonists, cytokine blocking antibodies and signalling protein inhibitors were used to  identify the receptors and signalling pathways mediating PGI(2) analogue  effects. RESULTS: Th17 and Th22 cells were more abundant in individuals with SSc than in HD. PGI(2) analogues (iloprost, treprostinil and beraprost) significantly  increased IL-17A and IL-22 in vitro while decreasing IFNγ production both in SSc  and HD PBMC.

Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome,, Context: The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding  disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth  factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally  distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome, is key to megakaryocyte and platelet development, Context:  We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously","23100277, 24325358, 24325358, 17209061",GFI1B and NBEAL2 mutations are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"23861251, 21765412, 25258341, 21765413, 24325358, 23100277"
Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes. The context mentions a case of unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal producing a spinal epidural hematoma.,"Context:  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case demonstrates  that patients are sometimes reluctant to disclose folk medical treatments to Western physicians, and the proper diagnosis may depend upon the prowess of the  neuroradiologist, Context:  Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed, Context: STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case report. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies. Therapists need to have precise knowledge of human, Context:  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Subdural spinal hematoma (SDH) is a very rare entity;  however, it can lead to serious complications resulting from injuries to the  spinal cord and roots. Although acupuncture has been a popular method for the management of pain control, we encountered the first case of SDH after  acupuncture. PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to present the first case of  subdural hematoma after acupuncture and the reasons for the risks of blind cervical acupuncture. STUDY DESIGN: A case report and review of the previous literature are presented. METHODS: A 69-year-old man complained of progressive weakness in the right upper","8456713, 21082060, 21289580, 24094991","Yes, acupuncture can cause spinal epidural hematoma.","8456713, 21082060, 21289580, 27651774, 24094991, 25459742"
"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?",Yes.  The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.,"Context:  CEP-26401 is a novel orally active, brain-penetrant, high-affinity histamine H3  receptor (H3R) antagonist, with potential therapeutic utility in cognition  enhancement. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was, Context: mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: H3 receptors by selective H3 receptor antagonists has been shown to enhance the  release of neurotransmitters such as histamine, ACh, dopamine and  norepinephrine, among others, which play important roles in cognitive processes.  The cognitive-enhancing effects of H3 antagonists across multiple cognitive  domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also bolster confidence  in this therapeutic approach for the treatment of attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, although  a number of clinical studies examining the efficacy of H3 receptor antagonists  for a variety of cognitive disorders are currently underway, no clinical proof of concept for an H3 receptor antagonist has been reported to date. The  discovery of effective H3 antagonists as therapeutic agents for the novel  treatment of cognitive disorders will only be accomplished through continued research efforts that further our insights into the functions of the H3  receptor, Context: with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose  CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement","27222271, 22001260, 18469850, 27222271",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
