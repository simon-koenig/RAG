The  prevalence of birth-and-death long-term evolution over concerted evolution has  already been demonstrated in the linker histone H1 family as well as for the  H2A, H3, and H4 core histone families. However, information about histone H2B is  lacking. In the present work, we have analyzed the diversity of the members of this histone family across different eukaryotic genomes and have characterized  the mechanisms involved in their long-term evolution. Our results reveal that,  quite in contrast with other histones, H2B variants are subject to a very rapid process of diversification that primarily affects the male germinal cell lineage  and involves their functional specialization probably as a consequence of  neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization events after gene duplication.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,I don't know the answer. The provided context does not mention anything about HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants or their regulation of fetal hemoglobin.,"Context: is possible to use fetal hemoglobin induction to eliminate the residual α-globin  aggregates and achieve normal levels of hemoglobin. Transgenic K562 cell lines  and erythroid precursor cells from β(0)39-thalassemia patients were employed.  Gene therapy was performed with the lentiviral vector T9W. Induction of fetal  hemoglobin was obtained using mithramycin. Levels of mRNA and hemoglobins were  determined by qRT-PCR and HPLC. First, we analyzed the effect of mithramycin on  K562 transgenic cell lines harboring different copies of a lentiviral vector  carrying the human β-globin gene, showing that γ-globin mRNA expression and HbF  production can be induced in the presence of high levels of β-globin gene expression and HbA accumulation. We then treated erythroid progenitor cells from  β-thalassemic patients with T9W, which expresses the human β-globin gene and  mithramycin separately or in combination. When transduction with our lentiviral vector is insufficient to completely eliminate the unpaired α-globin chains,  combination of β-globin gene transfer therapy together with fetal hemoglobin  induction might be very efficacious to remove the excess of α-globin proteins in, Context: switch in haemoglobin expression, as well as the fetal to adult switch that is  unique to humans and old world monkeys. We discuss the nature of these switches  and models of their regulation. The factors that have been suggested to regulate  this process are then discussed. With the increased understanding and discovery  of molecular regulators of haemoglobin switching, such as BCL11A, new avenues of  research may lead ultimately to novel therapeutic, mechanism-based approaches to  fetal haemoglobin reactivation in patients, Context: Gene therapy might fall short in achieving a complete reversion of the  β-thalassemic phenotype due to current limitations in vector design and  myeloablative regimen. Following gene transfer, all or a large proportion of  erythroid cells might express suboptimal levels of β-globin, impairing the  therapeutic potential of the treatment.

Additionally, it's mentioned that Bax channel blocker partially","Context: Overexpression of TIEG1 could induce apoptosis in K562 cells and promote  apoptosis induced by HHT or velcade. TIEG1-induced apoptosis was shown to  involve Bax and Bim up-regulation, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL down-regulation, release of  cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of caspase 3 and  disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). We concluded  that TIEG1 is a key regulator which induces and promotes apoptosis through the  mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, Context: RESULTS: Modulated EHT treatment induced significant tumor destruction in HT29  xenografts with a peak of a sevenfold increase compared with the untreated  controls. The significant treatment-related elevation of DNA  fragmentation--detected with TUNEL assay--and apoptotic bodies between 24 and 72  h posttreatment was proof of a programmed cell death response. This was  associated with significant mitochondrial accumulation of bax and  mitochondrial-to-cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c proteins between 8 and 14  h. Cleaved caspase-3 levels were low and mainly localized to inflammatory cells.  The substantial cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and its 57-kDa activated fragment detected between 14 and 24 h  after treatment indicated AIF as an effector for DNA fragmentation.

Thus, our results demonstrate that  NANOG, a cell-fate regulatory molecule known to be important for ESC  self-renewal, also plays a novel role in tumor development, Context: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and  the third cause of cancer-related death. Poor understanding of the mechanisms  underlying the pathogenesis of HCC makes it difficult to be diagnosed and  treated at early stage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding single-stranded  RNAs of ~22 nucleotides in length, posttranscriptionally regulate gene  expression by base pairing with the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target  messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Aberrant expression of miRNAs is found in many if not  all cancers, and many deregulated miRNAs have been proved to play crucial roles  in the initiation and progression of cancers by regulating the expression of various oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In this Paper, we will summarize  the regulations and functions of miRNAs aberrantly expressed in HCC and discuss  the potential application of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC and their potential roles in the intervention of HCC, Context: Tumor development has long been known to resemble abnormal embryogenesis. The  embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal gene NANOG is purportedly expressed by  some epithelial cancer cells but a causal role in tumor development has remained  unclear. Here, we provide compelling evidence that cultured cancer cells, as  well as xenograft- and human primary prostate cancer cells express a functional  variant of NANOG. NANOG mRNA in cancer cells is derived predominantly from a  retrogene locus termed NANOGP8. NANOG protein is detectable in the nucleus of  cancer cells and is expressed higher in patient prostate tumors than matched  benign tissues. NANOGP8 mRNA and/or NANOG protein levels are enriched in putative cancer stem/progenitor cell populations.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide.","Context: Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone-associated tumor of children and young  adults. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein.  EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the  master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed  that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a  GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS/FLI targets are  also regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined  transcriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference  knockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS/FLI target gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4  promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its  promoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's  sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in  drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma, Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context: Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's  sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in  drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma  whose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those  with lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the  cancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for  GGAA-microsatellites in EWS/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data  also suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central  oncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene","19718047, 991106, 19718047","VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma includes vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide.","15626016, 20110048, 991106, 26271204, 9053479, 31197128, 10742059, 12441260, 7029293, 2667789, 2016622, 14521810, 15613556, 11531770, 7583389, 29541566"

The second AATAAA, located 73 nucleotides 3' of the first, directs cleavage and polyadenylation 18 nucleotides downstream at a minor polyA site.  One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site.

In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes. The context mentions ""apoptotic biomarkers among cancer patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe"", which includes Annexin V as a protein controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly.","Context: transducing signals only from c-RAF. In addition, KSR-2 may be involved in the  activation of many MAPK downstream signaling molecules such as p38 MAPK, IKAP,  AIF, and proteins involved in ubiquitin-proteasome, apoptosis, cell cycle  control, and DNA synthesis and repair pathways, as well as mediating crosstalks  between MAPK and several other signaling pathways, including PI3K and insulin  signaling. While interactions with these molecules are not known for KSR-1, it's  reasonable to hypothesize that KSR-1 may also play a similar role in mediating  these downstream signaling pathways, Context: liquidators. Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other  tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal  cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout. There is  growing evidence that insufficient apoptosis allows irradiated cells to survive  and thereby contributes to carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present survey is  to summarize the recent findings related to apoptotic biomarkers among cancer  patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe.  Among the particularly radiosensitive cancer sites, we focused on thyroid cancer  and leukemia. Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis. The data reviewed here  provide a mechanistic link between the apoptosis alterations and development of  radiation-related cancer in the 30-year post-Chornobyl period. We suggest that the type of mutations arising from misrepair of DNA double strand breaks (gene  fusion and amplification) is the initial signature event in radiation-induced  thyroid cancer.

Which key gene is involved in syndromic obesity phenotype of patients with 1p21.3 microdeletions?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2. After cytogenetic testing and full clinical  evaluation, we compared the results by FISH with the final clinical diagnosis  and karyotype results. We found that microdeletions of 22q11.2 were detected in  three of the five patients who were evaluated for DGS. The three cases with  microdeletions appeared clinically to have DGS while the two negative cases were  more atypical. High-resolution banding techniques did not detect a microdeletion  in any of the cases; however, one of the 20 patients had a translocation between  chromosomes 13 and 22. This patient also had a microdeletion of 22q11.2 detected  by FISH and clinical features of DGS. None of the patients who were evaluated for disorders related to DGS showed microdeletions. We conclude that FISH is a  useful, easily applied technique for the diagnosis of 22q11.2 microdeletion  syndromes, particularly DGS. This test may also be useful in genetic counseling and in both prenatal and postnatal diagnoses, Context: cardiac anomalies that could not be definitively classified. Cytogenetic  karyotype analysis was unremarkable in all cases. Microdeletion detection was  done by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH).  RESULTS: 14 of the 90 cases (about 16%) showed microdeletion in the examined  chromosomal region 22q11.2. Among the group with microdeletion were aortic arch  interruption (5/5), ventricular septal defect (2/20). Fallot's tetralogy (1/9)  and atrial septal defect (1/5). All the deletion carriers had other signs of the  DGS/VCFS complex. One parent each in two of the microdeletion patients had the  same microdeletions. CONCLUSION: In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of  dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition  to conventional cytogenetic testing. The incidence of this microdeletion seems to be especially high among patients with type B interrupted aortic arch, Context: New high-resolution cytogenetical technique identified an increased number of  terminal, interstitial and subtelomeric microdeletion as the etiology of many  syndromes of multiple congenital anomalies, mental retardation and facial  dysmorphy.

The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process, Context: contact one specific RNA base in the eight-nucleotide RNA target. The functions  of the N- and C-terminal flanking repeats R1' and R8', however, remain unclear.  Here, we report how the repeats contribute to overall RNA binding. We first  prepared three mutants in which R1' and/or R8' were deleted and then analyzed  RNA binding using gel shift assays. The assays showed that all deletion mutants  bound to their target less than the original hPUM, but that R1' contributed more  than R8', unlike Drosophila PUM. We next investigated which amino acid residues  of R1' or R8' were responsible for RNA binding. With detailed analysis of the  protein tertiary structure, we found a hydrophobic core in each of the repeats. We therefore mutated all hydrophobic amino residues in each core to alanine. The  gel shift assays with the resulting mutants revealed that both hydrophobic cores  contributed to the RNA binding: especially the hydrophobic core of R1' had a significant influence.

During scanning,, Context: There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The context mentions that microinjection of retroviral vector appears to hold the greatest promise for transgenic methods in humans.,"Context: modification of human T cells using the Sleeping beauty transposon system has  been approved. We have previously evaluated the utility of piggyBac as a  non-viral methodology for genetic modification of human T cells. We found  piggyBac to be efficient in genetic modification of human T cells with a  reporter gene and a non-immunogenic inducible suicide gene. Analysis of genomic  integration sites revealed a lack of preference for integration into or near  known proto-oncogenes. We used piggyBac to gene-modify cytotoxic T lymphocytes  to carry a chimeric antigen receptor directed against the tumor antigen HER2,  and found that gene-modified T cells mediated targeted killing of HER2-positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model. We have also used  piggyBac to generate human T cells resistant to rapamycin, which should be  useful in cancer therapies where rapamycin is utilized. Herein, we describe a method for using piggyBac to genetically modify primary human T cells. This  includes isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human  blood followed by culture, gene modification, and activation of T cells. For the, Context: here that Met activation by HGF impairs Fas-triggered apoptosis of primary  embryonic hepatocytes and cell survival correlates with inhibition of caspase-8  and caspase-3 activities. Furthermore, we found that HGF treatment prevents  degradation of FLIPL triggered by Fas activation. In contrast to this, Met  activation does not modulate FLIPL levels and its stability in untreated cells,  thus showing the specificity of this regulatory mechanism for embryonic  hepatocyte survival. Knocking down FLIP expression abolishes the ability of Met  to inhibit Fas-triggered hepatocyte death, demonstrating the functional  requirement of FLIP in HGF anti-apoptotic signals. By combining genetic and pharmacological approaches, we also demonstrate that the PI3K-Akt pathway is  required in embryonic hepatocytes to prevent Fas-triggered FLIP degradation and  death. Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to  Fas-related liver diseases, Context:  The theoretical possibility of applying gene transfer methodologies to the human  germline is explored. Transgenic methods for genetically manipulating embryos  may in principle be applied to humans. In particular, microinjection of retroviral vector appears to hold the greatest promise, with transgenic primates  already obtained from this approach.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

This article reviews the proper patient and product  selection for the management of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive  B-cell lymphomas, Context: the pivotal phase I/II trials, emerging real-world evidence and ongoing trials. RECENT FINDINGS: For decades, attempts at improvement of the poor prognosis of  patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma with new treatment regimens have been  disappointing. Since the first report of CD19-directed CAR-T-cell therapy in  2010, three constructs have been tested in large phase I/II trials and resulted  in 30-40% durable responses. This has led to Food and Drug Administration and  European Medicines Agency approval for axicabtagene ciloleucel and  tisagenlecleucel and filing of the biologics license application for  lisocabtagene maraleucel. Emerging real-world evidence seems to confirm the promising results. However, considerable toxicity, mainly cytokine release  syndrome and neurotoxicity limits their general applicability and not all  patients intended to be treated can be bridged during the manufacturing period due to kinetics of the disease.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme.,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective drug therapies that reduce  low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), cardiovascular disease (CVD)  remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, additional LDL-C reduction may be warranted, especially for patients who are unresponsive  to, or unable to take, existing LDL-C-reducing therapies.

However, in patients at high cardiovascular risk,  achievement of optimal LDL-C levels is challenging, and therefore additional  strategies for further loweing LDL-C levels are under development. Recently,  silencing of apolipoprotein B gene and MTP inhibition have been approved for the  treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and there is great  interest in the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9).  PCSK9 promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor. The inhibition of PCSK9 favors LDL catabolism and reduces plasma LDLC levels.

The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,Camels are considered the likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV.,"Context: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has  resulted in a global pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Zoonotic diseases are infections that are  transmitted from animals to humans. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely  originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate  host. Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts. Further studies are needed on different wild animal  species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet  markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well. Additional research is needed to  understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals,  modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic, Context: fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and  limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed, Context: vertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some  flaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a  viremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus  replicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary  secretions to another vertebrate host. Virus replicates in the vertebrate host,  causing viremia and sometimes illness. The ability to infect and replicate in  both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and  flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of  wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue  virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a  human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause  widespread and serious epidemics.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm.,"Context: Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome  of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability. Quantifying the RNA-seq analysis by smFISH reveals that only 10% of bulk mRNA  molecules accumulate in mammalian stress granules and that only 185 genes have  more than 50% of their mRNA molecules in stress granules. These results suggest, Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

The deletion strains carry molecular barcodes designed to be  complementary with the protein gene deletion collection enabling parallel  analysis experiments. These strains will be useful for the numerous genomic and  molecular techniques that utilize deletion strains, including genome-wide  phenotypic screens under different growth conditions, pooled chemogenomic  screens with drugs or chemicals, synthetic genetic array analysis to uncover  novel genetic interactions, and synthetic dosage lethality screens to analyze  gene dosage. Overall, we created a valuable resource for the RNA community and for future ncRNA research, Context: Submicroscopic deletions of chromosome 22q11 have been reported in a multiple  anomaly syndrome variously labelled as velocardiofacial syndrome, conotruncal  anomaly face syndrome, and Di George syndrome. Most 22q11 microdeletions occur  sporadically, although in some cases the deletion may be transmitted. We  describe two affected sibs with confirmed 22q11 deletions from unaffected  parents who are not deleted. Haplotype analysis demonstrates that the deletion in the affected sibs has occurred on the same maternal chromosome 22.  Furthermore, an unaffected sib was found to have inherited the same maternal  haplotype at 22q11 in an undeleted form. This is the first molecular demonstration of germ line mosaicism for a microdeletion at chromosome 22q11 and  highlights the need for caution in estimation of recurrence risks, even when  constitutional deletions have been excluded on parental analysis, Context:  Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth associated  with macrocephaly and delayed psychomotor development. Patients with Sotos  syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving NSD1 or its point mutations. We identified the common 5q35 deletion in a patient with atypical Sotos syndrome  manifesting extremely severe developmental delay, joint hypermobility, and skin  hyperextensibility, which are recognized as Marfanoid hypermobility syndrome.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context does not mention Abf1 acting as an insulator. It discusses its role in transcriptional regulation and binding to promoters, but does not describe it as an insulator.","Context: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the large majority of the genes coding for  cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (RPs) depend on the general regulatory factor  Rap1 for their transcription, but a small cohort of them relies on Abf1  regulatory activity. A recent study showed that unlike Rap1, whose association  with RP gene promoters is not affected by environmental changes causing RP gene  repression/reactivation, Abf1 association with both RP gene and ribosome  biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells, Context:  Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to  transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to  replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast. In spite of their widespread roles in transcription, the scope of their functional targets  genome-wide has not been previously determined. Here, we use microarrays to  examine the contribution of these essential GRFs to transcription genome-wide, by using ts mutants that dissociate from their binding sites at 37 degrees C.

Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can  be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals.
