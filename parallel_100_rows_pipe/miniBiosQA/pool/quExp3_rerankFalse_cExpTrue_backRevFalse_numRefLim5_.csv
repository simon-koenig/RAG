What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Specifically, genetic events affecting genes that control H3K9 methylation have been identified. These alterations can contribute to the pathogenesis","Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9).

To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene encodes for DNA polymerase θ in humans. This is explicitly stated in the context.","Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize, Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources.

CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: identified a C>T transition at nucleotide position c.718. This nucleotide change  resulted in the substitution of highly conserved arginine by cysteine at codon  240 (R240C).

Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity.

Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the  absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing, Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms.

Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization  on three-dimensionally preserved nuclei (3D-FISH), in combination with confocal  microscopy, has become an effective technique for analyzing 3D genome structure  and spatial patterns of defined nucleus targets including entire chromosome territories and single gene loci. This technique usually requires the  simultaneous visualization of numerous targets labeled with different colored  fluorochromes. Thus, the number of channels and lasers must be sufficient for the commonly used labeling scheme of 3D-FISH, ""one probe-one target"".

The closely related genera Babesia and  Theileria also have small mt genomes (6.6 kb) that are monomeric linear with an organization distinct from Plasmodium.

A synthetic minimal cell will provide an  appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems  with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and  construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a  cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome.  Kinds of approaches, based on bioinformatics and molecular biology, have been  developed and proceeded to derive essential genes and minimal gene sets for the  synthetic minimal genome. Experiments about streamlining genomes of model bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created, Context: SNOT-22 scores at 3 months.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits monomethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1). This is mentioned in the context where it states ""PR-Set7, the cell cycle-reg","Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription. Histone methylation and  demethylation are dynamic processes controlled respectively by histone  methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs). Several HMTs and HDMs have  been implicated in cancer, inflammation, and diabetes, making them attractive  targets for drug therapy. Hence, the discovery of small-molecule modulators for  these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive,, Context: The multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) encodes P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of  the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family that confers tumor drug  resistance by actively effluxing a number of antitumor agents. We had previously  shown that MDR1 transcription is regulated by epigenetic events such as histone  acetylation, and had identified the histone acetylase P/CAF and the  transcription factor NF-Y as the factors mediating the enzymatic and  DNA-anchoring functions, respectively, at the MDR1 promoter. It has also been  shown that MDR1 activation is accompanied by increased methylation on lysine 4  of histone H3 (H3K4). In this study, we further investigated histone methylation in MDR1 regulation and function. We show that the mixed lineage leukemia 1  (MLL1) protein, a histone methyltransferase specific for H3K4, is required for  MDR1 promoter methylation, as knockdown of MLL1 resulted in a decrease in MDR1 expression. The regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 has functional consequences in that  downregulation of MLL1 led to increased retention of the Pgp-specific substrate  DIOC(2)(3), as well as increased cellular sensitivity to several Pgp substrates, Context: Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational  modifications of core histones. Here we show that the H1 linker histone plays a  key role in regulating both DNA methylation and histone H3 methylation at the  H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1 subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription.

Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?,"Yes, a de novo mutation in FGFR3 gene that causes glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 380 (G380R) is commonly associated with achondropl","Context: affected individuals. More then 97% of persons with achondroplasia have a  Gly380Arg mutation in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor  receptor (FGFR) 3 gene. Mutations in the FGFR3 gene also result in  hypochondroplasia, the lethal thanatophoric dysplasias, the recently described  SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans)  dysplasia, and two craniosynostosis disorders: Muenke coronal craniosynostosis  and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans. Recent evidence suggests that  the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees  of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively active.

Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for  metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted  survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to  determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS: This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with  MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009  were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected prospectively to October 2011. Patients were divided into three groups--Group 1  (Tokuhashi score 0-8, n = 84), Group 2 (Tokuhashi score 9-11, n = 83) and Group  3 (Tokuhashi score 12-15, n = 34).

Growth factor (i.e.  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor)-induced phosphorylation of Bax  has been reported to negatively regulate its proapoptotic function. Because Bax  is ubiquitously expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung  cancer cells, nicotine may mimic growth factor(s) to regulate the activity of  Bax. We found that nicotine potently induces Bax phosphorylation at Ser-184,  which results in abrogation of the proapoptotic activity of Bax and increased  cell survival.

Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function.

Results from clinical  trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The  biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials  was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible  differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A  ligand, Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints.

It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2).

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Yes, the mode of inheritance of FSHD is autosomal dominant. This means that only one copy of the altered gene, inherited from either parent, is sufficient to cause the disorder.","Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy).

STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular  dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the  facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to  chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading  candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in  human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human  DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy).

In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study with rats, there is evidence that tomato juice can lower cholesterol levels. The study found that rats fed with tomato juice had significantly lower total, LDL and HDL cholesterol","Context: RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid  profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL)  remained unchanged. The serum antioxidant status improved following juice  intake, as revealed by an increase in total antioxidant capacity and a slight  decrease in lipid peroxidation. The serum levels of homocysteine, a  cardiovascular risk factor, decreased following n-3 PUFA-enriched juice  consumption. A decrease in vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels was also  noted after intake of either plain or enriched tomato juice, whereas  intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels only decreased following intake of the enriched juice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, stronger positive amelioration of CVD risk factors was  observed following the intake of n-3 PUFA-enriched juice than after plain tomato juice consumption, which suggested a possible synergistic action between n-3  PUFAs and tomato antioxidants, Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

RESULTS: Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and  identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically  mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the  human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription  factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1  and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotype. Furthermore, activity of  this network varied significantly between the human subgroups, was associated  with metastatic disease, and predicted poor survival specifically within the SHH subgroup of tumours. Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the  most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation,  and network activity in both mouse and human tumours was characterised by, Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development, Context: BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours  affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups.  Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of  tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes  (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput  genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations. Here, we have mutagenised the Ptch+/- murine tumour model using the Sleeping Beauty transposon  system to identify additional genes and pathways involved in SHH subgroup  medulloblastoma development. RESULTS: Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and  identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically  mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the, Context: INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumor in  the pediatric population, accounting for 20-25% of all brain tumors in children.  Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in  medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation. PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the, Context: critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma  cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,"No, the context does not provide information about a phosphatase being inhibited by LB-1","Context:  Cells respond to stresses such as osmotic shock and heat shock by activating  stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), including c-Jun N-terminal kinase  (JNK) [1]. Activation of JNK requires phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TPY activation loop motif [2, 3] and can be reversed by the  removal of either phosphate group. Numerous JNK phosphatases including  dual-specificity phosphatases [4, 5], have been identified. Many stimuli activate JNK by increasing its rate of phosphorylation; however, JNK  dephosphorylation is inhibited in cells after heat shock [6], suggesting that a  JNK phosphatase(s) is inactivated. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase, Context: multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle  specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts  directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic  regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating  formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and  independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and  phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex  dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance  in the β-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein  20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L)  result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers. These findings provide insights  into the mechanisms underlying fine-tuned regulation of protein phosphatase-1  and its impact on the SERCA2/phospholamban interactome in cardiac function, Context: residues in the TPY activation loop motif [2, 3] and can be reversed by the  removal of either phosphate group.

In the current study, we investigated the molecular  mechanisms controlling protein phosphatase-1 activity. Using recombinant  proteins and complementary in vitro binding studies, we identified a multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle  specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts  directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic regions of the proteins.

Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib.

Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following  reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of  pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two  fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously  produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result.

Using updated bioinformatic  analysis, we predict 21 new candidate microRNAs in HD. We propose future  strategies for unifying large-scale transcriptional and microRNA datasets with  the aim of explaining HD aetiology. By way of example, we show how available  genomic datasets can be integrated to provide independent, analytical validation  for dysregulation of REST and microRNA mir-124 in HD. As a consequence, gene  ontology analysis indicates that HD is characterised by a broad-based depression  of neural genes in the caudate and motor cortex. Thus, we propose that a  combination of REST, microRNAs and possibly other non-coding RNAs profoundly affect the neuronal transcriptome in HD, Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations.

Moreover, the wide range of  microRNA expression, from tens of thousands to just few molecules per cell,  complicated the detection of microRNAs expressed at low copy numbers.

These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth,  differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development  and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as  cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display  altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression.

What is CPX-351,CPX-3,"Context:  PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation. METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A, Context: AML is highest. Therapeutic options mainly consist of hypomethylating agents,  ongoing clinical trials and, less commonly, intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.  CPX-351, a novel liposomal formulation which encapsulates cytarabine and  daunorubicin in 5:1 molar ratio, has shown promising efficacy, leading to recent  US FDA approval for front-line therapy for patients with therapy-related AML and  AML with myelodysplasia-related changes based on a large multicenter Phase III  clinical trial. This review summarizes the clinical development of CPX-351 as  induction therapy, Context: BACKGROUND: CPX-351 (United States: Vyxeos®; Europe: Vyxeos® Liposomal), a  dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a  synergistic 1:5 molar ratio, is approved by the US FDA and the EMA for the  treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. In a pivotal  phase 3 study that evaluated 309 patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly  diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia, CPX-351 significantly  improved median overall survival versus conventional 7 + 3 chemotherapy  (cytarabine continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin for 3 days), with a comparable safety profile. A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease  or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare  survival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11,  2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient, Context: PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation.

Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome, Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrates that CPX-351 improved  quality-adjusted survival, further supporting the clinical benefit in patients  with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker. It binds to phosphatidylserine which is externalized to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane during apoptosis. This property makes it a widely used","Context: is signaling adjacent cells that this cell is committing suicide by  externalizing phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane.  Annexin V, a 32-kDa endogenous human protein, has a high affinity for  membrane-bound phosphatidylserine. We have coupled annexin V with the  bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m  HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues  undergoing apoptosis in vivo. In this report we describe the results of a series  of experiments in mice and rats to characterize the biologic behavior of  (99m)Tc-HYNIC- annexin V. Biodistribution studies were performed in groups of rats at 10-180 min after intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V. In  order to estimate the degree of apoptosis required for localization of  (99m)Tc-annexin V in vivo, mice were treated with dexamethasone at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, 5 h prior to (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V administration, to  induce thymic apoptosis. Thymus was excised 1 h after radiolabeled HYNIC-annexin  V injection; thymocytes were isolated, incubated with Hoechst 33342 followed by, Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process, Context:  Annexin V can be used to detect apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo, based on  its ability to identify extracellular phosphatidylserine, which arises during  apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the synthesis of fluorine-18 labelled annexin V as a positron emission tomography tracer for apoptosis  imaging. The distribution of [18F]annexin V and technetium-99m labelled annexin  V, a well-characterised SPET tracer for apoptosis imaging, was compared. [18F]annexin V was synthesised using N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate as an  18F labelling reagent. Synthesised and purified [18F]annexin V was confirmed by  SDS-PAGE. In an ex vivo imaging experiment, [18F]annexin V was intravenously, Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces  is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based  apoptosis assays. In this paper, we report a new class of Annexin V-based probes  for apoptosis. Luciferase from Renilla reniformis (RLuc) was linked to Annexin V  and expressed successfully in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of Renilla luciferase can be detected by luminometric measurements. The  availability of Rluc/Annexin V may be of potential commercial interest for  improving current apoptosis assays","10541822, 7622868, 14666384, 16331047, 23000925","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"

Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the  ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the BLM helicase, which seems to play a role  in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby  promoting chromosome stability. The Werner syndrome gene (WRN) helicase, another member of the RecQ family like BLM, has very recently been found to help mediate  homologous recombination.

These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context: DNA repair mechanisms are essential for cellular survival in mammals. A rapid  repair of DNA breaks ensures faster growth of normal cells as well as cancer  cells, making DNA repair machinery, a potential therapeutic target. Although  efficiency of these repair processes substantially decrease the efficacy of  cancer chemotherapies that target DNA, compromised DNA repair contributes to  mutagenesis and genomic instability leading to carcinogenesis. Thus, an ideal target in DNA repair mechanisms would be one that specifically kills the rapidly  dividing cancer cells without further mutagenesis and does not affect normal  cells. Endo-exonucleases play a pivotal role in nucleolytic processing of DNA ends in different DNA repair mechanisms especially in homologous recombination  repair (HRR) which mainly repairs damaged DNA in S and G2 phases of the cell  cycle in rapidly dividing cells. HRR machinery has also been implicated in cell, Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed.

These proteins are part","Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: binding proteins. Finally, we showed that slight and unique binding preferences  might exist between the three HP1 proteins in Drosophila. These studies are the  first to systematically analyze the interactome of HP1 paralogs and provide the  basic clues as to the molecular mechanism by which HP1 might control cellular  processes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Most eukaryotes have at least three HP1 homologs with  similar domain structures but with differential roles in heterochromatin and  euchromatin. However, little is known about the overall interactome of the three  Drosophila HP1 homologs, HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c. The present study compared  interacting proteins of three HP1 homologs in Drosophila. To better understand the underlying mechanisms for gene regulation of HP1, a double-affinity  purification and MudPIT mass spectrometry were employed to identify differential  proteins as well as common binding proteins of HP1. Therefore, this study provides not only the comparative proteomic analysis but also molecular  mechanism underlying the HP1 homolog-specific function, Context: vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity.

Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein, Context: neoplastic transformation in vertebrates.

Although palmitoylation does not  regulate the normal forward or reverse ion transport modes of NCX1, NCX1, Context:  Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid  (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a  thioester linkage. Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation  site is conserved through most metazoan phlya. Although palmitoylation does not  regulate the normal forward or reverse ion transport modes of NCX1, NCX1, Context:  Protein palmitoylation, a common post-translational lipid modification, plays an  important role in protein trafficking and functions. Recently developed  palmitoyl-proteomic methods identified many novel substrates. However, the whole picture of palmitoyl substrates has not been clarified. Here, we performed  global in silico screening using the CSS-Palm 2.0 program, free software for  prediction of palmitoylation sites, and selected 17 candidates as novel palmitoyl substrates. Of the 17 candidates, 10 proteins, including 6 synaptic  proteins (Syd-1, transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP) γ-2, TARP  γ-8, cornichon-2, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα, and, Context:  Protein S-palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM)  in blood stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. S-palmitoylation  refers to reversible covalent modification of cysteine residues of proteins by saturated fatty acids. In vivo, palmitoylation is regulated by concerted  activities of DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases (DHHC PATs) and acyl protein  thioesterases (APTs), which are enzymes responsible for protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, respectively.

It potently blocks  HIV-1 infection and targets an epitope in the second domain of CD4 without  interfering with immune functions mediated by interaction of CD4 with major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. We report here the crystal  structure of ibalizumab Fab fragment in complex with the first two domains  (D1-D2) of CD4 at 2.2 Å resolution. Ibalizumab grips CD4 primarily by the BC-loop (residues 121-125) of D2, sitting on the opposite side of gp120 and  MHC-II binding sites. No major conformational change in CD4 accompanies binding  to ibalizumab. Both monovalent and bivalent forms of ibalizumab effectively block viral infection, suggesting that it does not need to crosslink CD4 to  exert antiviral activity. While gp120-induced structural rearrangements in CD4  are probably minimal, CD4 structural rigidity is dispensable for ibalizumab, Context:  In this open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study a fully human anti-CD40  antagonist monoclonal antibody, lucatumumab, was evaluated in patients with  relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of posterior uveitis in immunocompetent  subjects and congenital toxoplasmosis transmission was the first parasite to be  linked to human lesions in the eye. An experimental model for congenital ocular  toxoplasmosis was developed in C57BL/6 mice with the purpose to evaluate  Toxoplasma induced ocular pathology during fetal life. Toxoplasma gondii, ME-49  strain, was used to infect pregnant females. Histological analysis of pre-natal  fetal eyes from infected female mice, did not show parasite infestation,  however, alterations were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and in the inner nuclear layers (INL) of the retina. Edema was also observed, characterized  by the increase of interstitial spaces forming lacunae between the ONL and INL  cells and a net of vessels associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate.

The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. This is mentioned in the second and third contexts. They are used because of their ability to integrate genetic information into chromosomes, which can be useful for functional genomics, gene transfer","Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: of signals and their transmission led to the discovery and the use of Bone  Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). The development of cellular therapy led to the  emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which  include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV).  Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have  successfully been transfected. The ability to control transfected cells and the  capacity to combine and transfect many genes involved in osseous healing will  improve gene therapy, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Human APOBEC3 (A3) proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that potently  restrict the replication of retroviruses by hypermutating viral cDNA and/or  inhibiting reverse transcription. There are seven members of this family including A3A, B, C, DE, F, G, and H, all encoded in a tandem array on human  chromosome 22. A3F and A3G are the most potent inhibitors of HIV-1, but only in  the absence of the virus-encoded protein, Vif. HIV-1 utilizes Vif to abrogate A3 functions in the producer cells.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. The context mentions that tumour-specific antigens can be produced by somatic mutations and gene fusions in sequencing data, which would come from","Context: SUMMARY: Somatic mutations and gene fusions can produce immunogenic neoantigens  mediating anticancer immune responses. However, their computational prediction  from sequencing data requires complex computational workflows to identify  tumor-specific aberrations, derive the resulting peptides, infer patients' Human  Leukocyte Antigen types and predict neoepitopes binding to them, together with a  set of features underlying their immunogenicity. Here, we present nextNEOpi (nextflow NEOantigen prediction pipeline) a comprehensive and fully automated  bioinformatic pipeline to predict tumor neoantigens from raw DNA and RNA  sequencing data. In addition, nextNEOpi quantifies neoepitope- and patient-specific features associated with tumor immunogenicity and response to  immunotherapy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: nextNEOpi source code and documentation are  available at https://github.com/icbi-lab/nextNEOpi, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with  the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question  the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context:  PURPOSE: Microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from loss of functional DNA  mismatch repair was recently found in various haematological disorders. In  coding sequences, MSI leads to frameshift mutations (FSMs) and the production of C-terminally altered proteins which are foreign to the immune system.

This is stated in the context as it mentions that ""Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a common autosomal dominant cr","Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a relatively common craniosynostosis disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified  in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The TWIST gene product is a  transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains. Numerous  missense and nonsense mutations cluster in the functional domains, without any  apparent mutational hot spot. Two novel point mutations and one novel polymorphism are included in this review. Large deletions including the TWIST  gene have been identified in some patients with learning disabilities or mental  retardation, which are not typically part of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Comprehensive studies in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome have demonstrated a TWIST gene abnormality in about 80%, up to 37% of  which may be large deletions [Johnson et al., 1998]. The gene deletions and, Context: phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper  eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild  cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow,  fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is  thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed  in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to  distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already  made in a family member, Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a common autosomal dominant craniosynostosis in  humans, is characterized by brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly and facial  dysmorphism including ptosis, facial asymmetry, and prominent ear crura.  Previously, we identified a yeast artificial chromosome that encompassed the  breakpoint of an apparently balanced t(6;7) (q16.2;p15.3) translocation  associated with a mild form of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We now describe, at the  DNA sequence level, the region on chromosome 7 affected by this translocation  event. The rearrangement occurred approximately 5 kb 3' of the human TWIST locus  and deleted 518 bp of chromosome 7. The TWIST gene codes for a transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) motif and has recently been  described as a candidate gene for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, based on the  detection of mutations within the coding region. Potential exon sequences flanking the chromosome 7 translocation breakpoint did not hit known genes in  database searches. The chromosome rearrangement downstream of TWIST is  compatible with the notion that this is a Saethre-Chotzen syndrome gene and, Context: BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome further  characterized by distinctive facial and limb abnormalities. It shows complete  penetrance and variable expressivity and has been linked to the TWIST gene on  chromosome 7p21; more than 80 different intragenic mutations and, recently,  large deletions have been detected in Saethre-Chotzen patients. The aim of this  study was to genetically and phenotypically characterize patients with a  clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic  diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 34) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome are brachycephaly (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad,  depressed nasal bridge (65 percent), a high forehead (56 percent), ptosis (53 percent), and prominent auricular crura (56 percent). Furthermore, using  different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were  identified in 71 percent of patients, Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common autosomal dominant form of  craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the sutures of the calvarial bones of  the skull. Most Saethre-Chotzen syndrome cases are caused by haploinsufficiency for the TWIST gene. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the Twist gene  replicate certain features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, but have not been  reported to exhibit craniosynostosis.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells.

Which proteins does RG-7992 target?,"No, the context does not provide information about which proteins RG-7112 targets. The context only mentions that RG-7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM","Context: Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic  machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore  into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with  the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior  to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their  implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective  autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor  proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic  degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic  machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific  proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition  sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for  their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as, Context: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence  of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies.

It was tested against the PPTP in vivo panel focusing on p53 wild-type (WT)  xenografts at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days followed by 4 weeks of  observation. Response outcomes were related to MDM2 and p53 expression datasets  (http://pptp.nchresearch.org/data.html). RESULTS: RG7112 demonstrated cytotoxic activity with a lower median IC(50) for p53 WT versus p53 mutant cell lines (approximately 0.4 µM vs. >10 µM,  respectively).

Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in, Context: cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A  crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with  RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell  lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response observed in osteosarcoma cells with MDM2 gene amplification. Interestingly,  inhibition of caspase activity did not change the kinetics of p53-induced cell  death. Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis  biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression.

Which part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?,"No, the context does not provide information about which specific part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). It only mentions that a polymorphism","Context:  A polymorphism in high-affinity receptor of TNF (TNFR2) gene, Met196Arg, was  reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese,  whereas the association could not be found in Europeans at all and this represents an apparent discrepancy. The association, then, should be tested in  other populations to clarify the possible involvement, if any, of the TNFR2  polymorphism in SLE or other related autoimmune diseases. The purposes of this study were to examine the TNFR2 polymorphism in Japanese patients with SLE and  to investigate its association with other autoimmune diseases accompanied by  vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, Buerger's disease, and Takayasu's, Context:  We recently reported the association of the allele coding for Arg at the  position 196 (196R: nucleotide [nt] 587G) of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2  (TNFR2, TNF-R75) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese. In the present study, we completed the variation screening of the entire coding region  of TNFR2. Three new single nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding sequence  (cSNPs), as well as several variations within the promoter, introns and 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR), were identified. Among the new SNPs, nt168G, a  synonymous substitution (K56K), was in tight linkage disequilibrium with nt587G.  Two other cSNPs, nt543 (C-->T) (P181P) and nt694 (G-->A) (E232K), were not, Context:  A number of studies reported associations of HLA-DRB1, TNFalpha (TNF) promoter  and TNF receptor II (TNFR2, TNFRSF1B) polymorphisms with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), however, the results have often been inconsistent. Such lack of consistency could partly derive from the population admixture involved  in the case-control study. To avoid such a problem, polymorphisms in these genes  were analyzed using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in Caucasian SLE families. Ninety-one Caucasian SLE family samples recruited in southern  California were analyzed for the association with HLA-DRB1, TNF promoter  positions at -1031, -863, -857 and -308, and TNFR2-196M/R polymorphisms, Context: causal cis-eQTLs. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types  localised to discrete epigenetic annotations. We applied a linear mixed-effects  model to distinguish cis-eQTLs modulating all expression elements of a gene from  those where the signal is only evident in a subset of elements. Exon-level  analysis detected disease-associated cis-eQTLs that subtly altered transcription  globally across the target gene.

Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8.

Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context as they ""transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress.""","Context: Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal  transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by  TPEN. In addition, Zn2+ is released in cells treated with arsenite, before  stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological, Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal  transduction proteins.

These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological ligand of TIA-1, acting as a stress-inducible second messenger to promote  multimerization of TIA-1 and subsequent localization into stress granules, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation.

Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three  females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces. Proband 5 also had a brain tumor (ganglioglioma) at  the age of 3 years. In probands 1-3, direct sequencing identified a novel CREBBP  missense mutation, c.2728A > G (predicting p.Thr910Ala), that was absent in, Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder  characterised by facial dysmorphisms, growth and psychomotor development delay,  and skeletal defects. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven  imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder  and is characterized by mental retardation, distinctive facial features, broad  and often angulated thumbs and great toes. We report on a 7 year old boy with classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. His facial and clinical features were very  typical, including broad thumbs with radial angulation and broad great toes.

One protein, TcdA, has recently been expressed in  transgenic plants and shown to confer insect resistance. These toxins therefore  represent alternatives to toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for deployment  in transgenic crops. Levels of TcdA expression in transgenic plants were,  however, low and the full toxicity associated with the native toxin was not  reconstituted.

Moreover, these same pairs of proteins can also cross-potentiate a  second toxin, TcaA1B1. To elucidate the likely functional domains present in these large proteins, we expressed fragments of each 'toxin' or 'potentiator'  gene within mammalian cells. Several domains produced abnormal cellular  morphologies leading to cell death, while others showed specific phenotypes such as nuclear translocation.

Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. This is suggested by its ability to prevent changes in locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increase MDA levels, and reduce catalase activity in the brain","Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV.

Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity, Context: methide of TGZ and N-acetylcysteine. From electrochemical oxidations of  rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and ciglitazone in the presence of GSH, no GSH  conjugates could be identified. These three compounds all contain a  thiazolidinedione moiety. In conclusion, it has been shown that the primary  reactive metabolite of TGZ formed from electrochemical oxidation was the  o-quinone methide, and this metabolite was similar to what was observed to be  the primary reaction product in human and rat liver microsomes, Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation, Context:  Although idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are rare, they are still a major  concern to patient safety. Reactive metabolites are widely accepted as playing a  pivotal role in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. While there are today well established strategies for the risk assessment of stable  metabolites within the pharmaceutical industry, there is still no consensus on  reactive metabolite risk assessment strategies.

The, Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine.

The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract. Those bearing mutations had the classical  triple A syndrome of achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a  progressive neurological syndrome. We identified a spectrum of associated, Context:  The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis.

Current studies show that bupropion facilitates the  acquisition of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats, further suggesting  that bupropion enhances the rewarding properties of nicotine. Bupropion has been  shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials, bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL).

Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. Additionally, SLE may involve any number of organ systems and varies greatly in the severity and type of involvement. Cutaneous manifestations of SLE are frequently the presenting","Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve any number of organ  systems and varies greatly in the severity and type of involvement. Cutaneous  manifestations of SLE are equally numerous and varied throughout the course of the disease within an individual, as well as varying between patients. Cutaneous  manifestations of SLE are frequently the presenting symptoms, typically noted in  the classic malar ""butterfly"" rash; however, other cutaneous patterns are frequently observed.

An earlier study showed that SLE patients carrying an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature in blood have elevated  serum levels of IFN-regulated chemokines. These chemokines were associated with  more-severe and active disease and showed promise as SLE disease activity biomarkers. This study was designed to validate IFN-regulated chemokines as  biomarkers of SLE disease activity in 267 SLE patients followed up  longitudinally.
