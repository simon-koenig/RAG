What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,I don't know the answer.   (Note: The provided context does not mention histone lysine methylation or its implications in medulloblastoma.),"Context:  Epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in the pattern of gene  expression that is controlled by a mechanism specifically not due to changes the  primary DNA sequence. Well-known epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications and RNA-based mechanisms including  those controlled by small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs). Recent studies have shown  that epigenetic modifications orchestrate the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis. In this review we focus on the aberrant  methylation of CpG island promoters of select genes is the prominent epigenetic  mechanism to effectively silence gene transcription facilitating HSC activation, Context:  Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in, Context:  An epigenetic change is defined as an alteration in gene expression that does  not involve a change in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications, including  DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events.  However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences  such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. Given that  epigenetic modifications are heritable and reversible, in contrast to genetic  changes, they have been identified as promising targets for disease prevention, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation","23707524, 14688019, 23448446, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. These lncRNAs contain consensus Sam68 binding sites and their stability is affected by Sam68 deficiency.","Context: lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas  depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"H4 Lys 20 methylation. This is mentioned in the context as being consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis, closely following the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys 20 methyltransfer","Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted, Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes, Context: We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression.

These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that incubating Kv1.3-positive isolated mitochondria with Bax triggered apoptotic events, including the release of cytochrome c.","Context: Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins has the ability to  form transmembrane pores large enough to allow cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, as  well as to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP);  however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from, Context: Members of the Bcl-2 family play key roles as proapoptotic (e.g., Bax) and  antiapoptotic (e.g., Bcl-x(L)) regulators of programmed cell death. We  previously identified the mitochondrial potassium channel Kv1.3 as a novel  target of Bax. Incubating Kv1.3-positive isolated mitochondria with Bax  triggered apoptotic events, whereas Kv1.3-deficient mitochondria were resistant  to this stimulus. Mutation of Bax at lysine 128 (BaxK128E) abrogated its effects  on Kv1.3 and the induction of apoptotic changes in mitochondria. These data  indicate a toxin-like action of Bax on Kv1.3 to trigger at least some of the  mitochondrial changes typical for apoptosis. To gain insight into the mechanism of Bax-Kv1.3 interaction, we mutated Glu158 of Bcl-x(L) (corresponding to K128  in Bax) to lysine. This substitution turned Bcl-x(L) proapoptotic. Transfection  of double knockout (Bax(-/-)/Bak(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO MEFs) with either wild-type Bax, BaxK128E, or Bcl-x(L)E158K showed that apoptosis  induced by various stimuli was defective in DKO MEFs and BaxK128E-transfected  cells, but was recovered upon transfection with Bcl-xLE158K or wild-type Bax, Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes. In the provided contexts, MALAT-1 expression is mentioned as being upregulated in some tumors, including bladder cancer and lung cancer.","Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context:  INTRODUCTION: The functions of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have remained  elusive in many cases. Metastasis-Associated-in-Lung-Adenocarcinoma-Transcript-1  (MALAT-1) is an ncRNA that is highly expressed in several tumor types. METHODS: Overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches were used for the  analysis of the biological functions of MALAT-1 RNA. Tumor growth was studied in  nude mice. For prognostic analysis, MALAT-1 RNA was detected on paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue probes (n = 352)  using in situ hybridization. RESULTS: MALAT-1 was highly expressed in several human NSCLC cell lines. MALAT-1, Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique  loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of  splicing or gene expression. In lung cancer, MALAT1 does not alter alternative, Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are","22722759, 22088988, 23243023, 23073843",Malat-1 expression is upregulated in several tumor types,"21266177, 16878148, 24163781, 22722759, 21678027, 16441420, 18006640, 23845456, 20007090, 22858678, 23726266, 15552795, 22088988, 12970751"
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta gene are responsible for Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH), but does not mention any involvement of TR alpha1 mutations.","Context:  Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear  thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are  transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in  the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating  levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This  ""inappropriate"" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism,  where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually, Context: Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited  syndrome of reduced end-organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone. Patients with  RTH have elevated serum free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3)  concentrations and normal or slightly elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone  (TSH) level. Despite a variable clinical presentation, the common characteristic  clinical features are goitre but an absence of the usual symptoms and metabolic  consequences of thyroid hormone excess. Patients with RTH can be classified on  clinical grounds alone into either generalized resistance (GRTH), pituitary  resistance (PRTH) or combined. Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta gene are responsible for RTH and 122 different mutations have now been  identified belonging to 300 families. With the exception of one family found to  have complete deletion of the TRbeta gene, all others have been demonstrated to have minor alterations at the DNA level. The differential diagnosis includes a  TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and the presence of endogenous antibodies  directed against thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Failure to, Context:  Thyroid hormones are essential for brain development. The active thyroid  hormone, T3, binds to several products of two genes, the nuclear thyroid hormone  receptors alpha and beta, and thus regulates gene expression. Mutations in a thyroid hormone transmembrane transport protein, monocarboxylate transporter 8  (MCT8), underlie one of the first described X-linked mental retardation  syndromes, the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. This discovery sparked great interest in the process of thyroid hormone transmembrane transport.  Iodothyronines are charged amino acid derivatives and require protein  facilitators to cross cellular membranes. Thyroid hormones are translocated, Context: pituitary form hyperthyroidism requires treatment in order to lower TSH  secretion. In the peripheral form, various symptoms of thyroid hormone  deficiency may be observed, contrasting with normal T3, T4 and TSH serum levels,  and requiring supraphysiological doses of T3 for correction. In most cases,  familial occurrence can be evidenced, with an autosomal dominant or sometimes  recessive mode of inheritance. Genetic analysis has identified, in the  generalized form, more than 10 mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta  gene, all resulting in an alteration in the T3 binding domain of the receptor.  In the autosomal dominant form, tissue resistance may result from a ""dominant inhibitory effect"" of the normal receptor function by the mutant receptor. All  these thyroid hormone resistance syndromes constitute exceptional models for  studying the mechanisms of action of thyroid hormones. Simultaneous observations of the mutated receptors with various clinical and biological phenotypes should  further our understanding of thyroid hormone receptor function","8594618, 17132274, 20879691, 8115332",thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations are implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome,"23528896, 23633213, 12750454"

The effects of imetelstat on telomere length, DNA damage response, and cell proliferation were assessed. The efficacy of imetelstat in vivo was  evaluated in subcutaneous xenografts derived from each of the cell lines.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as  measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and  phosphorylation of TP53.

Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterised by low bone  mineral density resulting in fractures. 85-90% of patients with OI carry a  variant in the type 1 collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. However, within the last two decades,  there have been growing number of variants identified in genes that follow an  autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Our proband is a child born in Mexico with multiple fractures of ribs, minimal calvarial mineralisation,  platyspondyly, marked compression and deformed long bones.

Molecular studies have established that a  common pathway exist, both between the FA proteins and other proteins involved  in DNA repair such as NBS1, ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Stem cell transplantation  (SCT) is the only option for establishing normal hematopoiesis. To reduce undue  toxicities due to inherent hypersensitivity, nonmyeloablative conditioning for  transplants has been advocated. This review summarizes the general clinical and  hematologic features and the current management of FA. Fanconi anemia (FA) is  the commonest type of inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with the birth  incidence of around three per million. The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive with the estimated heterozygote frequency being one in 300 in Europe  and the US, Context: OBJECTIVES: To identify the phenotype, genetic defect and inheritance pattern of  ectopia lentis et pupillae (ELP) in a large Dutch family, previously diagnosed  as presumed autosomal dominant ELP because of the occurrence of ELP in three  generations.  DESIGN: A clinical and genetic study of children and adults. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients of the ELP family, including five new patients from  the youngest generation. METHODS: Standard ophthalmological examinations were performed. For molecular  genetic analysis, the coding region of ADAMTSL4 was sequenced. Main outcome  measures were the ocular phenotype of the new ELP patients, the inheritance  pattern and the identification of mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene in the family. RESULTS: Of the eight patients with ectopia lentis, seven fulfilled the clinical  diagnostic criteria of ELP. Molecular genetic analysis of these seven patients  disclosed two novel mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene: homozygous (p.Q752X/p.Q752X) in six patients and compound heterozygous (p.Q752X/p.Q758fs) in one patient.  Heterozygosity in phenotypically normal parents proved autosomal recessive (AR)  inheritance.

A decrease in vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels was also  noted after intake of either plain or enriched tomato juice, whereas  intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels only decreased following  intake of the enriched juice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, stronger positive amelioration of CVD risk factors was  observed following the intake of n-3 PUFA-enriched juice than after plain tomato  juice consumption, which suggested a possible synergistic action between n-3  PUFAs and tomato antioxidants, Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context:  PURPOSE: We compared the effects of consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  acids (PUFA)-enriched tomato juice versus plain tomato juice on the serum lipid  profile and levels of biomarkers related to antioxidant status and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women. METHODS: Eighteen healthy women participated in a 2-week intervention trial  involving the daily intake of 500 mL of n-3 PUFA-enriched juice (n = 11) or plain tomato juice (n = 7). Each serving of enriched juice provided 250 mg of  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Both juices provided  natural antioxidant compounds such as phenolics (181 mg) and lycopene (26.5 mg), Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension and other indications.,"Context: not isradipine would solely inhibit the proliferation of cultured gingival  fibroblasts. Normal human gingival fibroblast Gin-1 cells were used to test the  impact of this medication. Fibroblast proliferation in the presence of  isradipine (10 microM) was examined by using the reagent water-soluble  tetrazolium-1 (WST-1). The level of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the  cell-free supernatant of each well was determined by using an enzyme-linked  immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications, Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: BACKGROUND: Recent examination of the STEADY-PD III isradipine clinical trial  data concluded that early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) participants who had  longer exposure to isradipine had a significant delay in their need for  symptomatic medication, as well as a lower medication burden at the end of the  trial. These findings suggest that greater exposure to isradipine might slow  disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To test this hypothesis, the data from the STEADY-PD II isradipine  clinical trial, in which an extended-release (ER) formulation of the drug was  used, was re-examined. METHODS: The re-analysis of the STEADY-PD II data was restricted to participants  assigned placebo or tolerable isradipine treatment (10 mg isradipine/day or  less). The effect of isradipine treatment was assessed by Unified Parkinson's, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: inhibitor was found to decrease the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation  of microsomal polypeptides. Unexpectedly, inhibitor 2 was also found to markedly  decrease protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban as well  these other microsomal substrates. These results are consistent with the views  that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated  phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by  calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions,  calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is  also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely  active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa)  that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Protein  phosphatase 2B is also capable of dephosphorylating these three substrates, Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the, Context:  The immunosuppressor cyclosporin A inhibits the  peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase activity of cyclophilins and the resulting  complex inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin.

Among the cholinergic  properties studied, choline uptake was specifically inhibited by cyclosporin A to a maximum of 40%. Cyclosporin A decreased the rate of choline transport but  not the binding of the non-transportable choline analogue hemicholinium-3,  indicating that the number of membrane transporters was not affected. Through, Context: Various genes have been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of  follicular thyroid tumors. Cowden syndrome is the only known familial syndrome  with an increased risk of both follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and carcinoma  (FTC). Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a  dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with  Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular  thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in PTEN, which maps to  10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of  markers within 10q22-24 occurs in about 25%. Recently, another phosphatase gene, MINPP1, has been localized to 10q23.3. MINPP1 has the ability to remove  3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates, a function that overlaps that of  PTEN. Because of this overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, we  considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could contribute to the  pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide.   These three drugs are specifically mentioned as being administered to 14 patients with Ewing's sarcoma in the context.","Context: Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone-associated tumor of children and young  adults. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein.  EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the  master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed  that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a  GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS/FLI targets are  also regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined  transcriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference  knockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS/FLI target gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4  promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its  promoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's  sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in  drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma, Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's  sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in  drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma  whose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those  with lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the  cancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for  GGAA-microsatellites in EWS/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data  also suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central  oncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene, Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,The most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AAUAAA.,"Context: bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to  adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs  preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors, Context: and 35.3%, respectively). Western blotting revealed that the activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p34(cdc2) was significantly  decreased in oocytes and cumulus cells treated with 3'-dA at a concentration of  1 microg/ml or greater. To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms,  expression patterns and polyadenylation states of four important genes, C-mos,  cyclin B, GDF9 and BMP15, were studied as representative maternal transcripts by  real-time PCR and the PAT assay. 3'-dA at concentrations above 1 microg/ml  significantly prevented polyadenylation and caused aberrant expression of C-mos  and GDF9 during oocyte maturation. These results suggest that polyadenylation inhibitor blocked pig oocyte maturation in vitro by one or more of the following  actions: (1) inactivation of MAPK and MPF in oocytes, especially at the late  stages (MI and MII); (2) prevention of cumulus cell expansion through inactivation of cellular MAPK; and (3) inhibition of the maternal mRNA  polyadenylation process, which in reverse, disrupted the maternal mRNA patterns  in pig oocytes' maturation in vitro, Context: pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter.

A  polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) nearby the 3' end of pre-mRNA is required for  poly(A) synthesis. The protein complex involved in the pre-mRNA polyadenylation  is coupled with RNA polymerase II during the transcription of a gene. According  to the commonly accepted view, only RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II can be  polyadenylated in an AAUAAA-dependent manner. Here we report the polyadenylation of short interspersed elements (SINEs) B2 and VES transcripts generated by RNA  polymerase III. HeLa cells were transfected with SINE constructs with or without  polyadenylation signals.

The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based apoptosis assays.,"Context:  The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces  is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based  apoptosis assays. In this paper, we report a new class of Annexin V-based probes for apoptosis. Luciferase from Renilla reniformis (RLuc) was linked to Annexin V  and expressed successfully in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells.

The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle.

Which key gene is involved in syndromic obesity phenotype of patients with 1p21.3 microdeletions?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is well established as a key  player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Clinical studies show calcitonin  gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has  revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related  peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with  high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for  antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing, Context: disease, PanNET probably progress according to a specific pathway of  carcinogenesis. Our aim was to characterize by molecular quantitative analysis a  panel of molecules implicated in the VHL pathway and in tumor progression in the  PanNET of patients with VHL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of 52 genes was studied by quantitative  reverse transcriptase PCR in 18 patients with VHL operated on for PanNET and  compared with 16 non-VHL PanNET. The VHL and non-VHL tumors were matched  according to their size and cell proliferation. For some genes, we looked for  differences in the protein expression in VHL PanNET (n = 31), microadenomas (n = 22), and non-VHL PanNET (n = 16), included in tissue microarray blocks. RESULTS: Nineteen (36%) genes were significantly upregulated and three (6%)  downregulated in VHL PanNET. The upregulated genes were related to (i) hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) molecules (CA9, HIF2A, and GLUT1), (ii)  angiogenesis (CDH5, VEGFR1, EDNRA, ANGPT2, CD34, VEGFR2, VEGFA, and ANGPT1),  (iii) the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (VIM) and/or metastasis, Context: METHODS: Published microarray dataset of TNF-α-induced HepG2, human  transcription factor database HTRI and human protein-protein interaction  database HPRD were used to construct and analyze the signal transduction  network.

In the present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a  differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2,  two components of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide mapping of  Sall1-binding loci has identified 591 genes, 80% of which are also targeted by  Nanog. A large proportion of these genes are related to self-renewal and  differentiation. Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene  transcriptional regulation. In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Specifically, the induction of the  gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal  markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements, which may play a role in carcinogenesis.","Context: expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis, Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: MicroRNA (miRNA) influences carcinogenesis at multiple stages and it can  effectively control tumor radiosensitivity by affecting DNA damage repair, cell  cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, radio-related signal transduction pathways and  tumor microenvironment. MiRNA also efficiently modulates tumor radiosensitivity  at multiple levels by blocking the two essential non-homologous end-joining  repair and homologous recombination repair pathways in the DNA damage response. It interferes with four radio-related pathways in ionizing radiation, including  the PI3-K/Akt, NF-κB, MAPK and TGFβ signaling pathways. Moreover, the regulatory  effect of miRNA in radiosensitivity can be enhanced when interacting with various key molecules, including H2AX, BRCA1, ATM, DNA-PK, RAD51, Chk1, Cdc25A,  p53, PLK1, HIF-1 and VEGF, which are involved in these processes. Therefore,  thoroughly understanding the mechanism of miRNA in tumor radiosensitivity could, Context: and exogenous damage.

In  summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that  supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0  mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity. Future efforts with  lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy, Context: and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially  enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat  to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor efficacy of vorinostat.

A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools.

The acupuncture  treatment was alternately administered at each side of the ears on a weekly, Context:  BACKGROUND: In complementary medicine literature studies on long-term  observation of one of its methods are rare. OBJECTIVE: The present study is an evaluation of the smoking behavior of patients treated with ear acupuncture for smoking cessation. Additionally we  investigated factors that favor or impede smoking cessation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 249 patients who had undergone ear acupuncture for smoking cessation between 1985 and 1998 in a practice in Aarau (Switzerland) were asked  before the first treatment to fill in a form regarding their smoking behavior  and retrospectively in autumn 1998 a questionnaire regarding the success of, Context: BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for human diseases of the lung,  heart, circulatory system and various kinds of cancers, and is a serious public  health problem worldwide. Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality  for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females). The treatment group (n = 59) received auricular acupuncture in Shen Men, Sympathetic, Mouth and Lung points for 8 weeks. The control group (n = 59)  received sham acupuncture in non-smoking-cessation-related auricular acupoints  (Knee, Elbow, Shoulder and Eye points).

List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.,Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is metabolized by monoamine oxidase A (MAOA).,"Context: inhibitory action of this drug on the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A),  which is the main enzyme involved in dopamine biodegradation. Afobazole was also  found to increase the content of serotonin (5-HT) as well as its precursor  (5-OTP) and its main metabolite (5-HIAA) in hypothalamus by up to 50, 60 and  50%, respectively, which confirms a hypothesis that this anxiolytic drug can  modulate the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (5-OTP synthesis enzyme). In  contrast to afobazole, ladasten demonstrated the ability to increase the level  of L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) in virtually all functional structures of the  brain (except for hippocamp), which may support the hypothesis suggestion concerning a predominant action of this drug on the activity of tyrosine  hydroxylase. Ladasten exhibited selectivity with respect to the dopaminergic  system and affected only parameters of the dopamine metabolism, in particular, by increasing the HVA content in nucleus accumbens and decreasing it in the  hypothalamus. The drug also affected the dopamine turnover parameters, producing  an increase in both HVA/dopamine ratio in nucleus accumbens and DOPAC/dopamine, Context: senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30)/gluconolactonase (GNL) knockout (KO) mice  placed in an AA-deficient state. METHODS: At 30 days of age, mice were divided into the following 4 groups: AA  (-) SMP30/GNL KO, AA (+) SMP30/GNL KO, AA (-) wild type (WT), and AA (+) WT. The  AA (+) groups were given water containing 1.5 g/L AA, whereas the AA (-) groups  received water without AA until the experiment ended. In addition, all mice were  fed an AA-depleted diet. Catecholamine levels were measured by a liquid  chromatographic method. Tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, dopamine  β-hydroxylase, and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA expression levels were measured with the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).  Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase protein levels were quantified  by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: In the adrenals of AA (-) SMP30/GNL KO mice, noradrenaline and  adrenaline levels decreased significantly compared to other three groups of  mice, although there were no significant differences in dopamine β-hydroxylase, Context: recommendation for daily RLS is dopamine agonists or gabapentin or low-potency  opioids. Levodopa is less preferred for treating daily RLS due to its high risk  of augmentation. For intermittent RLS, it is levodopa or dopamine agonists or  low-potency opioids or benzodiazepines. For refractory RLS, the choice is to  change to gabapentin or a different dopamine agonist, addition of a second agent  like gabapentin or benzodiazepine to the existing drug or changing to a  high-potency opioid or tramadol. Medications with safety record in pregnancy  include opioids and antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and gabapentin.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous.

The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

In addition,  evolocumab has been approved by the FDA for homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of PCSK9  inhibitors are unknown, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents.

Additionally, we  analyzed by mass spectrometry the composition of TFIID and SAGA complexes in  mouse and human cells and found that their global integrity is maintained, with  minor changes, during erythroid cell differentiation and development. In  agreement with our functional data, we show that TAF10 interacts directly with  GATA1 and that TAF10 is enriched on the GATA1 locus in human fetal erythroid  cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate a cross talk between canonical TFIID and  SAGA complexes and cell-specific transcription activators during development and differentiation, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated  transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes. We propose that Ski  cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering  with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  Thermoplasma acidophilum, a thermophilic mycoplasma, has several unusual  features suggesting a possible relationship to eukaryotic cells. One feature is  a histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin. A second feature is an  association of cytoplasmic proteins that resembles eukaryotic actin and myosin.  These two components are widely distributed in different groups of eukaryotic cells, but are typically lacking in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, T.  acidophilum lacks cytochromes and respires by enzymes that apparently are not  coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. This primitive type of respiration, Context: their reappearance when the direction of the pressure was reversed. In this  manner, codon UGA and anticodon UCA for tryptophan could have disappeared under  GC pressure and reappeared in Mycoplasma under AT pressure. Stop codon UGA may  have been the third of the three stop codons to appear, originating from  mutations in UAA. Changes in the code are adaptive and nondeleterious. We  propose that the number of anticodons has increased and that evolution continued  until three existing forms of the universal code were produced: eukaryotic,  eubacterial, and the code for halobacteria and methanococci. These three codes  are distinguished from each other by their anticodon pattern. The eukaryotic code contains eight INN (ANN) anticodons that have replaced GNN anticodons as a  result of AT pressure. Mitochondrial and chloroplast codes have evolved from the  eubacterial code through genomic economization and AT pressure, leading to losses of GNN and CNN anticodons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Context: subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin. A second feature is an  association of cytoplasmic proteins that resembles eukaryotic actin and myosin.  These two components are widely distributed in different groups of eukaryotic  cells, but are typically lacking in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, T.  acidophilum lacks cytochromes and respires by enzymes that apparently are not  coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. This primitive type of respiration  resembles that of microbodies, another feature which is represented in the  cytoplasm of all groups of eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, since T. acidophilum  lacks a cell wall and appears to have a primitive correlate of endocytosis, it would appear to be mechanically capable of acquiring a symbiotic mitochondrion.  Thus, our observations are consistent with the symbiotic hypothesis for the  origin of eukaryotic cells. We suggest that an organism similar to T. acidophilum was the host cell for the original symbiosis, becoming the nucleus  and cytoplasm of modern eukaryotic cells, Context: significantly more similarity in genome signatures with animal Mt sequences than  do all other available prokaryotes.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the  intima of an artery, known as intimal hyperplasia, is an important component of  cardiovascular diseases. This is seen most clearly in the case of in-stent restenosis, where drug eluting stents are used to deliver agents that prevent  VSMC proliferation and migration. One class of agents that are highly effective  in the prevention of in-stent restenosis is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Inhibition of mTOR blocks protein synthesis, cell cycle  progression, and cell migration. Key to the effects on cell cycle progression  and cell migration is the inhibition of mTOR-mediated degradation of p27Kip1, Context: analysis revealed that the insertion was attributed to two additional exons that  would be predicted to produce premature termination codons (PTC) in ABCC4. The  highly similar mouse Abcc4 gene also contained these exons, which were  remarkable because their size and sequence identity were much higher than the  overall similarity between these genes. Further, a comparison of human, monkey  and rodent ABCC4 genes revealed that these same PTC-producing exons were also  highly conserved in evolution. As all the ABCC4 mRNA containing these PTC exons  might produce nonsense mRNA, we further tested the hypothesis that these mRNAs  were targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Protein synthesis inhibition selectively stabilized PTC containing ABCC4 transcripts in human, monkey and  rodent cell lines. Moreover, the amount of PTC-containing ABCC4 transcripts was  critically dependent upon protein synthesis, as removal of the inhibitor dramatically decreased expression, which correlated with the resumption of  protein synthesis. These are the first studies to indicate that the highly  conserved PTC exons of the ABCC4 gene may dictate its expression, Context: DESIGN: Sixteen healthy, older adults were randomly assigned to receive either  omega-3 fatty acids or corn oil for 8 wk.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had no effect on the basal rate of muscle  protein synthesis (mean ± SEM: 0.051 ± 0.005%/h compared with 0.053 ± 0.008%/h before and after supplementation, respectively; P = 0.80) but augmented the  hyperaminoacidemia-hyperinsulinemia-induced increase in the rate of muscle  protein synthesis (from 0.009 ± 0.005%/h above basal values to 0.031 ± 0.003%/h above basal values; P < 0.01), which was accompanied by greater increases in  muscle mTOR(Ser2448) (P = 0.08) and p70s6k(Thr389) (P < 0.01) phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acids stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older, Context: dyspnea, dysphagia, fasciculations, reduced tendon reflexes, impaired  consciousness, myoglobinuria, renal failure, or hyperthermia. Diagnosis of these  drug-induced myopathies is based on history, clinical neurologic examination,  blood work, urine analysis, repetitive stimulation, electromyography, and muscle  biopsy. A drug which induces muscular side effects should never be given again.  Particularly in patients suffering from primary myopathy, myotoxic drugs should  be applied with caution. The drugs which most frequently induce muscular side  effects are steroids, statins, fibrates, antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants,  colchicine, amiodarone, and anticancer drugs. Many drugs exhibit their myotoxic potential only in combination with other drugs or premorbid pathologic myogenic  conditions","24276258, 12499391, 21159787, 16575599",Bimagrumab blocks the activin type II receptors.,30095981
List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"The mutation identified in GATA1 gene is a G-to-A mutation at position 759 corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.  Additionally, biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene have been implicated in Gray Platelet Syndrome","Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but  not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a  spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose, Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized  by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets. The  genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with  inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and α-granule deficiency. All  of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the α-granule content by  immunofluorescence analysis for α-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9  novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included, Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait.

Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes. Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a spinal epidural hematoma in the provided context.,"Context: Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case demonstrates  that patients are sometimes reluctant to disclose folk medical treatments to  Western physicians, and the proper diagnosis may depend upon the prowess of the  neuroradiologist, Context:  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Subdural spinal hematoma (SDH) is a very rare entity;  however, it can lead to serious complications resulting from injuries to the  spinal cord and roots. Although acupuncture has been a popular method for the management of pain control, we encountered the first case of SDH after  acupuncture. PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to present the first case of  subdural hematoma after acupuncture and the reasons for the risks of blind cervical acupuncture. STUDY DESIGN: A case report and review of the previous literature are presented.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?",Yes.  The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 had some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations.,"Context: concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose-  and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major  elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep,  with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement, Context: with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose  CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement, Context: prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have  therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: the removal of brain Aβ via anti-Aβ antibodies. After an active vaccine (AN1792)  was discontinued in 2002 due to occurrence of meningoencephalitis in  approximately 6% of patients, several other second-generation active Aβ vaccines  and passive Aβ immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical  investigation with the aim of accelerating Aβ clearance from the brain of AD  patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab,  which is composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies that has been  tested in two Phase II trials. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden  in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its  clinical use. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab  will provide answers regarding whether passive anti-Aβ immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease","27222271, 27222271, 22001260, 21091109",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
