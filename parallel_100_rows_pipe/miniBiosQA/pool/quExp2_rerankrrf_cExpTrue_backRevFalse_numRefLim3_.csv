What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The context does not provide information about the implications of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma.   However, it mentions that extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas and the","Context:  Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation","14688019, 19747111, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis.

Describe RIblast,RIblast is a method based on the seed-and-extension approach for RNA secondary structure prediction. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model.,"Context: two sequences share a (sufficiently long) fragment with more than 70% of  similarity? As a result, the local alignment sometimes produces a mosaic of  well-conserved fragments artificially connected by poorly-conserved or even  unrelated fragments. This may lead to problems in comparison of long genomic  sequences and comparative gene prediction as recently pointed out by Zhang et  al. (Bioinformatics, 15, 1012-1019, 1999). In this paper we propose a new  sequence comparison algorithm (normalized local alignment ) that reports the  regions with maximum degree of similarity. The algorithm is based on fractional  programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm, Context: structures. Dividing the series of core secondary structures into two subseries  creates a cut set of long-range interactions. If we use N, M and C to represent  the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the  maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds  an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function  of N and M when C = O(log(N + M)). When running on structure-sequence alignment  problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves  the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman  sequence-sequence alignment algorithm, Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions  using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA  secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that  RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing  programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.

However, GMOL's multi-scale approach allows users to scale between six separate levels within the genome, which could potentially be","Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context:  MOTIVATION: Genome plotting is performed using a wide range of visualizations  tools each with emphasis on a different informative dimension of the genome.  These tools can provide a deeper insight into the genomic structure of the  organism. RESULTS: Here, we announce a new visualization tool that is specifically  designed for chloroplast genomes. It allows the users to depict the genetic  architecture of up to ten chloroplast genomes in the vicinity of the sites connecting the inverted repeats to the short and long single copy regions. The  software and its dependent libraries are fully coded in R and the reflected plot  is scaled up to realistic size of nucleotide base pairs in the vicinity of the, Context: genome that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as  chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA  shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA  binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser  for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at  http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller  twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the  entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the  GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative  values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide  resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly  and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start  sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species","26868282, 29659705, 25326329","Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.   (Note: There is no mention of Set7 in the provided context),"Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context: and FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 expression in the presence of a histone deacetylase  inhibitor and verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation the relative degree of  histone acetylation in the promoter regions of FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 under  FB-inducing and noninducing conditions. Moreover, we generated transgenic F.  verticillioides strains expressing GFP under the control of the FUM1 promoter to  determine whether its strength under FB-inducing and noninducing conditions was  influenced by its location in the genome. Our results indicate a clear and  differential role for chromatin remodeling in the regulation of FUM genes. This  epigenetic regulation can be attained through the modulation of histone acetylation at the level of the promoter regions of the key biosynthetic genes  FUM1 and FUM21, but less so for FUM8, Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions","21347206, 22117026, 24681537",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"These variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. They interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels.","Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is  marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin, Context:  Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,The epidermal growth factor family.,"Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers.

Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context: responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of  HER2-specific antibodies such as Herceptin relates to their ability to direct  HER2 to a Cbl- dependent endocytosis and degradation pathway. The reported  clinical therapeutic efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies in breast  cancer highlights the importance of understanding the biology of HER2, Context: Periampullary adenocarcinomas are rare neoplasm that originates from the  pancreatic head, the ampulla of vater, the distal bile duct or the duodenum.  Surgical resection followed by adjuvant therapy is considered as the standard of  care treatment for these carcinomas.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.","Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis, Context:  BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. However, it  remains unclear by what mechanism BAX is triggered to initiate apoptosis. Here,  we reveal the mechanism using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques.

We  show that upon apoptotic stimulus by BH3-only peptides, BAX can be induced to convert into either a ligand-bound monomer or an oligomer through a  conformational selection mechanism. The kinetics of reaction is studied by means  of time-resolved ESR, allowing a direct inÂ situ observation for the, Context:  Apoptosis research demonstrates that, even though the multitude of regulatory  circuits controlling programmed cell death might diverge, core elements of the  'apoptotic engine' are widely conserved. Therefore, studies in less complex model systems, such as the nematode and the fly, should continue to have a  profound impact on our understanding of the process.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes. MALAT-1 is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy organs as well as in NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma), indicating that it is upregulated in cancer.","Context: expression differences in stage I NSCLC tumors that either did or did not  metastasize in the course of disease. Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis. The identification of MALAT-1 emphasizes  the potential role of noncoding RNAs in human cancer, Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN Î² long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that most RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene, not TR alpha1.","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a genetic disease caused by the mutations  of the thyroid hormone beta receptor (TRbeta) gene, producing receptors with a  dominant negative action.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,IL-17A.   This is mentioned in the context as one of the inflammatory cytokines upregulated in psoriasis that brodalumab targets.,"Context:  INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by  dysregulation of the immune system and release of pro-inflammatory mediators.  Drugs available for psoriasis show some limits as tolerability and route of administration. Apremilast , OtezlaÂ®, is an oral small molecule recently  approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  Compared to biologics that target a single cytokine, apremilast, degrading phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), interferes with cyclic anti-microbial peptides,  which is involved in the transduction of intracellular signals, controlling the  balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, Context:  Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. Current biologic  therapies are highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis, transforming the  lives of patients with this significantly disabling disease. Advances in the understanding of the immunological pathogenesis of psoriasis have led to the  development of new biologic therapies, targeting specific inflammatory cytokines  upregulated in psoriasis. These include the IL-17 antagonists, secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab; the IL-23 antagonists, guselkumab and tildrakizumab;  and the oral small molecule therapies, tofacitinib and apremilast.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,Telomerase. It binds with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic activity.,"Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context: Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of AÎ² is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of AÎ² production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. AÎ² is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, Î² and Î³-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  Î³-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit AÎ² production in cultured cells.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,Idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema of the lower extremities.  Two most common symptoms are: 1. Lymphedema of the lower extremities 2. Intrahepatic cholestasis,"Context: Recent works have demonstrated an expansion of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat  in the first intron of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), encoding an  unknown C9ORF72 protein, which was responsible for an unprecedented large  proportion of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia  (FTD) cases of European ancestry. C9ORF72 is expressed in most tissues including  the brain. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that C9ORF72 mutations could  reduce the level of C9ORF72 variant 1, which may influence protein expression  and the formation of nuclear RNA foci. The spectrum of mutations is broad and  provides new insight into neurological diseases. Clinical manifestations of diseases related with C9ORF72 mutations can vary from FTD, ALS, primary lateral  sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), Huntington disease-like  syndrome (HDL syndrome), to Alzheimer's disease. In this article, we will review the brief characterizations of the C9ORF72 gene, the expansion mutations, the  related disorders, and their features, followed by a discussion of the  deficiency knowledge of C9ORF72 mutations.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,Autosomal dominant.   The context mentions that FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35.,"Context: in their father. This finding prompted a clinical reevaluation of the father and  brother. A subclinical phenotype restricted to abdominal muscle weakness was  detected, and serum creatine kinase values were found to be elevated in both.  The proband's brother also showed evidence of an independently occurring  subtelomeric rearrangement of 4q35, which normally occurs in about 20% of the  population. The identification of a ""borderline"" 38-kb EcoRI/BlnI fragment in an  affected subject and his very mildly affected relatives extends the size range  of disease alleles and expands existing data on the variable intrafamilial  expressivity of FSHD. This study highlights the importance of a careful molecular and clinical analysis extended to family members of apparently  sporadic cases with larger EcoRI/BlnI fragments for accurate diagnosis and  appropriate genetic counseling in FSHD, Context: region, resulting in relaxation of the chromatin structure and release of DUX4  repression. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally  epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. Stable expression of DUX4, however,  can only occur in the presence of a permissive genetic background, which  contains a polyadenylation signal sequence that stabilizes DUX4 mRNA. Expression  of DUX4 mRNA and protein occurs at low frequency but in high abundance in FSHD  myotube nuclei. DUX4 expression in transfection studies induces apoptosis and  interferes with myogenesis. SUMMARY: FSHD results from a unique combination of genetic and epigenetic changes on 4q35 leading to release of repression of DUX4, causing disease in a  toxic gain-of-function manner. Questions remain regarding the normal function of  DUX4 and how expression of DUX4 in somatic cells leads to FSHD, Context: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular  dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the  facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss  and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to  chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading  candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in  human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human  DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl)  mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less  pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality","10487912, 21734574, 23108159",Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.,"10864616, 10487912, 21795275, 15307599, 10969520, 23143600, 7739631, 22551571, 19248726, 22525183"
Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.","Context: (nâ€Š=â€Š8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context: hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Less frequent dosing in cardiovascular disorders.,"Context: Verapamil reverses multidrug resistance acquired by cancer cells during  treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin by inhibiting the  function of P-glycoprotein. Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the  cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. We have recently demonstrated that selective  inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression is among the earliest events in  doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. To explore the influence of verapamil on doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, we evaluated [14C]-doxorubicin accumulation, cardiac muscle gene  expression by Northern blot analysis, and ultrastructural changes in cultured  cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence of verapamil. Treatment with a combination of doxorubicin and verapamil for 24 h did not augment doxorubicin  accumulation in cardiomyocytes, although substantial augmentation of doxorubicin  accumulation by verapamil in cardiac fibroblasts was observed. Further,, Context: side effect profiles differ. These differences must be taken into consideration  in the selection of the most appropriate agent for a specific indication.  Potential advantages of some of the newer dihydropyridine calcium channel  antagonists include less frequent dosing (amlodipine and isradipine) and little  or no negative inotropic effect (nicardipine, felodipine, amlodipine,  isradipine) compared with the prototype calcium channel antagonists. Additional  clinical experience with these newer agents is required, however, before their  role in the management of cardiovascular disorders can be fully delineated. The  availability of sustained-release formulations of verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, felodipine, and nicardipine, as well as the recent marketing of  calcium channel antagonists with relatively long half-lives (amlodipine and  isradipine), makes once- or twice-daily dosing possible with most calcium channel blockers. However, selection of a particular agent will depend on  several factors, including clinical efficacy, side effect profile, cost, and  patient characteristics such as concomitant disease states and baseline  hemodynamic status, Context: adhesion molecules involved represents an attractive new treatment option.  Vedolizumab has recently received European and US regulatory approval for  treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease on the basis of encouraging  results from one of the largest phase III trial programmes ever conducted in the  field of inflammatory bowel diseases and promising safety data.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is inhibited by LB-100.,"Context: Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas (AAM) represent 20% of all meningiomas. They  are associated with poor outcomes due to their tendency to recur. While surgery  and radiation (RT) are first line therapy, no effective systemic medical  treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM.

While designing a diagnostic model for general  handheld imaging systems is an emerging trend, this article proposes a  computer-aided decision support system for macro images captured by a general-purpose camera. General imaging conditions are adversely affected by  nonuniform illumination, which further affects the extraction of relevant  information. To mitigate it, we process an image to define a smooth illumination, Context:  Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate","28969863, 29266819, 28026754","in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were derived for whole cohort. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients were identified with SS with equal gender  incidence. Median age of the cohort was 36 (14-76) years. The most common  primary site of disease was extremity (81.5%). 22/27 patients presented with  only localized disease and 59.2% of these received neo-adjuvant treatment. Of  those who received neoadjuvant treatment, 56.2% had NACRT, while 25.0% and 18.7%  of patients had chemotherapy and radiotherapy respectively. Mesna, doxorubicin,  ifosfamide, dacarbazine (MAID) was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen  as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment while ifosfamide (93.7%) was the most commonly used chemotherapy drug in any setting. There was no reported case of  disease progression in group of patients who received NACRT apart from one  patient who had oligometastatic disease at diagnosis.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,The most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AATAAA.,"Context: are two sequences with 75% homology to the consensus sequence,  (C/T)GTGTT(C/T)(C/T), identified by McLauchlan et al. [Nucl. Acids Res. 13,  1347-1365 (1985)]. An 80% homology match to the Berget consensus sequence,  CA(C/T)TG, begins five nucleotides 3' of the major polyA site (used 20 times  more than the second, downstream polyA site) [Berget Nature 309, 179-182  (1984)]. The second AATAAA, located 73 nucleotides 3' of the first, directs  cleavage and polyadenylation 18 nucleotides downstream at a minor polyA site.  One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site. No matches to the Berget consensus sequence are located near this second, weaker polyA site, Context: A compilation of the pre-mRNA ends of the genes of nuclear encoded mitochondrial  proteins resulted in a consensus sequence of the type (T/A)NTTNNNNNTTTNAATAAA.  Nucleotide positions +8, +13, +14, +16 and +17 downstream of the AATAAA sequence  show also a predominance of nucleotide T.

To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. It binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells.,"Context: criteria. Morphological characteristics include cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic  condensation, chromatin segregation and condensation, membrane blebbing, and the  formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, whereas the biochemical hallmark  of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA cleavage into oligonucleosome-length  fragments. A great deal of research is aimed at defining the molecular  mechanisms that play a role in apoptosis. As one of the common end points of  experiments related to apoptosis is in fact the death of the cell, it has become  important to develop reliable assays to measure cell death that may be compared  among the various systems being investigated. This chapter reviews many of the current methods used to measure apoptotic cell death and points out strengths  and weaknesses of each approach with respect to the system being examined and  the questions being asked. Traditional cell-based methods, including light and electron microscopy, vital dyes, and nuclear stains, are described. Biochemical  methods such as DNA laddering, lactate dehydrogenase enzyme release, and MTT/XTT  enzyme activity are described as well. Additionally, terminal deoxynucleotidyl, Context:  Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content, Context:  Apoptotic cells possess specific morphological and biochemical markers. Various  methods have been developed to detect apoptosis based on these markers. One of  the most common is the fragmentation of genomic DNA. In addition to electrophoresis for the identification of the characteristic 200 base pair  ladders and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick  end-labeling, DNA content analysis is often employed. This technique is based on the fact that permeablized apoptotic cells release fragmented DNA, resulting in  DNA content that is less than that in live diploid cells.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Symplekin, Ada protein","Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process, Context: The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and  polyadenylation, although in metazoa the replication-dependent histone mRNAs are  processed by 3'-end cleavage but not polyadenylation. The macromolecular complex  responsible for processing both canonical and histone pre-mRNAs contains the  approximately 1160-residue protein Symplekin. Secondary-structural prediction  algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of  all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were  investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation.

The two domains are of nearly equal size and are connected by a hinge  region. The Ada protein accepts stoichiometrically the alkyl group from  O6-alkylguanine in DNA at the Cys-321 residue and from alkyl phosphotriester at  the Cys-69 residue. This protein functions in DNA repair by direct dealkylation  of mutagenic O6-alkylguanine. The protein methylated at Cys-69 becomes a  transcriptional activator of the genes in the ada regulon, including its own.  Each of the two domains functions independently as an alkyl acceptor. The  purified homogeneous protein is unstable at 37 degrees C and spontaneously loses  about 30% of its secondary structure in less than 30 min concomitant with a complete loss of activity. However, sedimentation equilibrium studies indicated  that the inactive protein remains in the monomeric form without aggregation.  Furthermore, electrospray mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the absence of oxidation of the inactive protein. This temperature-dependent inactivation of  the Ada protein is inhibited by DNA.

List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.,"Dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.","Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including  dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean  schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs, Context:  Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient, Context: METHODS: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the  influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and  diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals:  20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: A groupÃ—genotypeÃ—abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The context mentions that retroviral vectors are attractive delivery vehicles for persistent transgene expression in gene therapy applications.,"Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context: of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis  by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes.  Co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter  could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR)","21247248, 24158830, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. These antigens are derived from short peptides of tumor-associated proteins that are processed by the cell's antigen processing machinery.,"Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival.

Accumulation of H  type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of  patients with BG status other than 0. Tumor-associated antigens, Lex and sialylated Lex were detected in 36.0% and 72.0%, respectively. Modification of  carbohydrate antigens in cancer may be associated with incomplete synthesis;  accumulation of precursor antigen; and activated sialylation, Context: The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune  surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides  derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules  expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now  numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated  control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the  intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of  tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to  as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma  (BL), is a classic example in this category.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9),"Context: Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of AÎ² is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of AÎ² production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. AÎ² is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, Î² and Î³-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  Î³-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit AÎ² production in cultured cells.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1.","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the Î²-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the Î²-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the Î²-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses.

In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression.

We explored the effect of early seizures  on day 90 outcomes, Context: calvarial expansion. A multidisciplinary root cause analysis suggested that  raised intracranial pressure and intraoperative tranexamic acid may have been  risk factors for the development of CRAO in these cases as no conventional risk  factors for CRAO following prone surgery were present.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,Camels.   The context mentions that MERS-CoV has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East.,"Context:  Coronaviruses are pathogens with a serious impact on human and animal health.  They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life  threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in  humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections,  and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This  highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these  viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses,, Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures  against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV","28643204, 28616501, 25791336",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the  genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position  encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2). The purpose of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of TNFR2 and its possible association with the  susceptibility to SLE, using the case-control association analysis. Polymorphism  screening of the exons containing previously reported nonsynonymous base substitutions was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single  strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, using genomic DNA from 81  Japanese patients with SLE and 207 healthy individuals.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"The cytoplasm. Stress granules are described as being colocalized with mutant FUS inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells, indicating that they form in the cytoplasm.","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic Î±-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-Î± isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-Î±2, but not AMPK-Î±1.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3 comprising cyclic adenosine","Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context: Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-APs) represent a class of  soluble proteins attached to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane by a  post-translation modification, the GPI anchor. The 28 genes currently involved  in the synthesis and remodelling of the GPI anchor add to the ever-growing class  of congenital glycosylation disorders. Recent advances in next generation  sequencing technology have led to the discovery of Mabry disease and CHIME  syndrome genetic aetiology. Moreover, with each described mutation known  phenotypes expand and new ones emerge without clear genotype-phenotype  correlation. A protein database search was made for human GPI-APs with defined pathology to help building-up a physio-pathological mechanism from a clinical  perspective. GPI-APs function in vitamin-B6 and folate transport, nucleotide  metabolism and lipid homeostasis. Defining GPI-APs role in disease bears significant clinical implications, Context:  Barth syndrome is an X-linked disorder usually diagnosed in infancy. It is  characterized by hypotonia, dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, growth  retardation, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. The syndrome is typically caused by mutations in the TAZ (G4.5) gene, which encodes a novel protein family called  the tafazzins. We report the case of two brothers with Barth syndrome and left  ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) caused by a splice donor mutation in TAZ. Both had impaired sucking ability at the age of 2 months.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The context does not provide specific information about the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. However, it mentions that inflammation affects thyroid function and that low plasma triiodothyronine (T3) may be an expression of the inflammatory","Context:  INTRODUCTION. It has been shown that inflammation affects thyroid function. In  patients with end-stage renal disease, low plasma triiodothyronine (T3) may be  an unsuspected expression of the inflammatory state of these patients. This study evaluated the correlation between T3 and high-sensitivity C-reactive  protein (HSCRP) levels in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis.  MATERIALS AND METHODS. This is a cross-sectional study aiming at the correlation between T3 and HSCRP levels among 30 patients on PD, 30 patients on  hemodialysis, and 20 healthy individuals.

Hypothyroidism has been linked with low grade inflammation, elevated risk of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. Secretory phospholipases (sPLA2) are  associated with inflammation, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Due to  potential linkage between thyroid hormone and sPLA2, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormone status on the regulation of secretory phospholipases in mice,  rats and human liver.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin attenuates neurodegenerative processes and related complications.,"Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 Âµl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused  oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted  super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial, Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-Î±, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,Activin type II receptors (ActRII).,"Context: associated with exercise, heart failure, age or drugs. In general, both  inherited and acquired changes include an increase in RyR channel activity.  Because of its central function, the RyR is a potential therapeutic target for  the inherited disorders and many of the acquired disorders. The RyR is currently  used as a therapeutic target in malignant hyperthermia where dantrolene is  effective and to relieve ventricular arrhythmia, with the use of JTV519 and  flecainide. These drugs show that the RyR is a valid therapeutic target, but  have side effects that prevent their chronic use. Thus there is an urgent need  for the development of skeletal and cardiac specific drugs to treat these diverse muscle disorders. In this review, we discuss the mutations that cause  skeletal myopathies and cardiac arrhythmias and how these mutations pinpoint  residues within the RyR protein that are functionally significant and might be developed as targets for therapeutic drugs, Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab  is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75Â years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10Â mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29.
