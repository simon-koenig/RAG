What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,I don't know the answer. The provided context does not mention medulloblastoma.,"Context: domains and throughout the cell cycle. We have studied the nuclear patterns of  histone H3 and H4 acetylation and of H3 methylation in Arabidopsis. A  replication-linked increase of acetylation only occurred at H4 lysine 16 (not  for lysines 5 and 12) and at H3 lysine 18. The last was not observed in other  plants. Strong methylation at H3 lysine 4 was restricted to euchromatin, while  strong methylation at H3 lysine 9 occurred preferentially in heterochromatic  chromocenters of Arabidopsis nuclei. Chromocenter appearance, DNA methylation  and histone modification patterns were similar in nuclei of wild-type and  kryptonite mutant (which lacks H3 lysine 9-specific histone methyltransferase), except that methylation at H3 lysine 9 in heterochromatic chromocenters was  reduced to the same low level as in euchromatin. Thus, a high level of  H3methylK9 is apparently not necessary to maintain chromocenter structure and does not prevent methylation of H3 lysine 4 within Arabidopsis chromocenters, Context:  Histone modification plays important roles in many biological processes such as  development and carcinogenesis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is  commonly associated with transcriptional activation of genes. H3K4 methylation in mammalian cells is carried out by COMPASS (complex of proteins associated  with Set1)-like complexes that are composed of catalytic subunits such as MLL1  (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) and multiple regulatory subunits in which WDR5 (WD40 repeat-containing protein 5), RBBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 5), ASH2  (absent, small or homoeotic discs 2) and DPY30 [constituting the WRAD  sub-complex (WDR5-ASH2-RBBP5-DPY30 complex)] are the major ones shared from, Context:  Methylation of DNA in combination with histone modifications establishes an  epigenetic code that ensures the proper control of gene expression. Although DNA  methyltransferases have been shown to interact with histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 27) and G9a (which  methylates histone H3 on lysine 9), the relationship between DNA methylation and  repressive histone marks has not been fully studied. In cancer cells, promoters of genes are often aberrantly methylated. Accordingly, 5-azacytidine (a DNA  demethylating drug) is used for treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.  However, no genome-scale studies of the effects of this drug have been reported","12581305, 25706881, 20305384","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"I don't know the answer. The context only mentions that 174 ncRNAs were differentially expressed during embryoid body differentiation, but it does not specify which ones are regulated by SAM68.","Context: The transcriptional networks that regulate embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency  and lineage specification are the subject of considerable attention. To date  such studies have focused almost exclusively on protein-coding transcripts.  However, recent transcriptome analyses show that the mammalian genome contains  thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which appear to be expressed  in a developmentally regulated manner. The functions of these remain untested. To identify ncRNAs involved in ES cell biology, we used a custom-designed  microarray to examine the expression profiles of mouse ES cells differentiating  as embryoid bodies (EBs) over a 16-d time course. We identified 945 ncRNAs expressed during EB differentiation, of which 174 were differentially expressed,  many correlating with pluripotency or specific differentiation events. Candidate  ncRNAs were identified for further characterization by an integrated examination, Context: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are key players in variety of biogenesis and biological  functions. Their aberrant expression has been implicated in disease progression.  NcRNAs can be divided into short ncRNAs whose subtypes are mainly microRNA  (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA). They are  involved in cellular processes, including gene regulation, development and  disease. The retina is a remarkably sophisticated instrument with interconnected  cell types and is the primary target of many genetic diseases. In addition, in  terms of retinal dyshomeostasis and inflammation, ncRNAs seems to play critical  roles in many retinal diseases. Here, we provide an overview of ncRNAs in developing retina. We also review how does these ncRNAs function in various  retinal diseases including animal and human models. These data indicate that  ncRNAs regulate cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and contribute to initiation and progression of  retinal diseases, Context:  The transcriptional networks that regulate embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency  and lineage specification are the subject of considerable attention.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,The SET7/9 methyltransferase deposits H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 histone marks.,"Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription. Histone methylation and  demethylation are dynamic processes controlled respectively by histone  methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs). Several HMTs and HDMs have  been implicated in cancer, inflammation, and diabetes, making them attractive  targets for drug therapy. Hence, the discovery of small-molecule modulators for  these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors â‰¥0.7) and sensitive,, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription.

What are the targets of pemigatinib?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Unlike ubiquitination, which targets proteins for degradation, sumoylation  modulates protein-protein interactions of target proteins. Although there are  multiple E2 enzymes required for ubiquitination, there is only one  E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, which is Ubc9. In line with increasing  evidence that sumoylation plays an important role in tumorigenesis, we recently  demonstrated that Ubc9 is expressed at high levels in advanced melanomas and  that blocking expression of Ubc9 sensitizes melanomas to the cytotoxic effects  of chemotherapeutic drugs. To determine whether and to what extent Ubc9 is  expressed in other malignancies and their normal tissue counterparts, we undertook a detailed analysis of colon, lung, prostate, and breast cancer tissue  microarrays. The findings, presented here, document that in primary colon and  prostate cancer, Ubc9 expression is increased compared with their normal tissue counterparts, whereas in metastatic breast, prostate, and lung cancer, it is  decreased in comparison with their corresponding normal and primary  adenocarcinoma tissues. We also provide evidence that Ubc9 expression correlates, Context: cancer tissues, and that miR-29s directly target both DNMT3A and -3B. The  enforced expression of miR-29s in lung cancer cell lines restores normal  patterns of DNA methylation, induces reexpression of methylation-silenced tumor  suppressor genes, such as FHIT and WWOX, and inhibits tumorigenicity in vitro  and in vivo.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"Yes. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients with bladder cancer, and avelumab has positive results for this indication.","Context: Intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine is the  main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with proven  effects on reducing recurrence, progression, and death from NMIBC. However, it  is not effective in all patients, and recurrence after adequate BCG therapy can  frequently lead to progression to more life-threatening disease. This  point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient  with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease,  that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of  induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full  course of bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not  likely to work; this meets the new definition of a ""BCG unresponsive"" disease. For this situation, the safest (curative) option is removal of the bladder.

Importantly, hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA of 90%  (18/20) superficial tumors with negative or atypia cytology. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of E-cadherin, p14 or RASSF1A in urine sediment  DNA is a potential biomarker for detecting superficial, low grade cancer.  Besides, hypermethylation of these 3 genes is a valuable adjunct diagnostic  marker to urine cytology, which can enhance the diagnostic accuracy and  follow-up treatment of bladder cancer patients, Context: attenuated bacterial Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin vaccine, which has been the  standard of care non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since 1990.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,Yes. The context mentions that Bax activation involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol.,"Context: Overexpression of TIEG1 could induce apoptosis in K562 cells and promote  apoptosis induced by HHT or velcade. TIEG1-induced apoptosis was shown to  involve Bax and Bim up-regulation, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL down-regulation, release of  cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of caspase 3 and  disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). We concluded  that TIEG1 is a key regulator which induces and promotes apoptosis through the  mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, Context: Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins has the ability to  form transmembrane pores large enough to allow cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, as  well as to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP);  however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-Î± plus cycloheximide to determine the effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from, Context: Apoptosis is frequently induced to inhibit virus replication during infection of  Enterovirus 71 (EV71). On the contrary, anti-apoptotic pathway, such as PI3K/Akt  pathway, is simultaneously exploited by EV71 to accomplish the viral life cycle.  The relationship by which EV71-induced apoptosis and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway  remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 infection  altered Bax conformation and triggered its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria in RD cells. Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from  mitochondria to cytosol. We also found that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was  activated during EV71 infection. The JNK specific inhibitor significantly inhibited Bax activation and cytochrome c release, suggesting that EV71-induced  apoptosis was involved into a JNK-dependent manner. Meanwhile, EV71-induced Akt  phosphorylation involved a PI3K-dependent mechanism.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Isradipine has been investigated as a suitable treatment for patients with glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow that will continue to deteriorate. It may slow the rate of progression of renal deterioration.,"Context:  N-type calcium channels located on presynaptic nerve terminals regulate  neurotransmitter release, including that from the spinal terminations of primary  afferent nociceptors. Accordingly, N-type calcium channel blockers may have clinical utility as analgesic drugs. A selective N-type calcium channel  inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a  novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. To develop a small-molecule N-type calcium channel blocker, the authors developed a 96-well plate  high-throughput screening scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for N-type calcium  channel blockers using [125I]-labeled omega-conotoxin GVIA as a channel-specific, Context: glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate.  Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a  suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration  rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers, isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics,, Context: side effect profiles differ. These differences must be taken into consideration  in the selection of the most appropriate agent for a specific indication.  Potential advantages of some of the newer dihydropyridine calcium channel  antagonists include less frequent dosing (amlodipine and isradipine) and little  or no negative inotropic effect (nicardipine, felodipine, amlodipine,  isradipine) compared with the prototype calcium channel antagonists. Additional  clinical experience with these newer agents is required, however, before their  role in the management of cardiovascular disorders can be fully delineated. The  availability of sustained-release formulations of verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, felodipine, and nicardipine, as well as the recent marketing of  calcium channel antagonists with relatively long half-lives (amlodipine and  isradipine), makes once- or twice-daily dosing possible with most calcium channel blockers. However, selection of a particular agent will depend on  several factors, including clinical efficacy, side effect profile, cost, and  patient characteristics such as concomitant disease states and baseline  hemodynamic status","16831862, 7738211, 8213473",Isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients,"2137344, 11172743, 14727944, 15257873, 8963604, 12215829, 1363224, 10854683, 7848351, 9544865, 8466736, 7918132, 7955262, 10728516, 7946181, 7621840, 2949585, 8213473, 7738211, 7789292, 8205296, 2150641, 2523644, 7921533, 2523646"

Calculation of the diagnostic score is achieved by dimension reduction.  Currently, IVDMIA is restricted to gene expression profiling, and will also be  applied to malignancies other than breast cancer, Context: Peptide aptamers are specific binders that are artificially created using in  vitro evolution systems. The peptide aptamers that can detect malignant cells in  vivo, or can bind surfaces of various materials will enable us to develop novel  types of cancer diagnosis and cancer therapy agents by combining with various  nano-carriers.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"VAC regimen includes Vincristine, Actinomycin D (also known as Dactinomycin), and Cyclophosphamide.","Context:  Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors that represent aÂ major challenge due to  varying clinical presentations and often interdisciplinary treatment concepts.  Gold standard for the treatment of localized resectable soft tissue sarcomas is complete surgical removal. In metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, systemic therapy  is the treatment of choice. The most active drugs are anthracyclines and  ifosfamide. Combination chemotherapy has improved both response rate and progression-free survival at the cost of increased toxicity. Imatinib at aÂ dose  of 400Â mg/day is the gold standard for patients with advanced or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In patients with aÂ mutation in KIT, Context: INTRODUCTION: Adult sarcomas are rare tumors characterized, in general, by their  poor prognosis and the paucity of effective treatments. However, the deeper  understanding of their underlying molecular pathology, signaling pathways and  key effectors has permitted the development of a number of drugs able to inhibit  important processes in sarcoma pathogenesis. Some of these novel compounds have  been assessed in clinical trials with successful results. AREAS COVERED: The latest reported trials are comprehensively reviewed. Thus,  the Phase III studies with pazopanib, regorafenib, muramyl tripeptide (MTP) and  ridaforolimus are extensively discussed as well as the biological rationale for the use of these compounds. In addition, the most promising drugs that still are  in earlier stages of development such as CDK4 and MDM2 inhibitors, cediranib,  eribulin and crizotinib are also discussed, Context: sarcoma was significantly longer than for patients with osteosarcoma (P =  0.004.) At the time of last follow-up, 7 patients (10%) were alive without  progression: 3 with Ewing's sarcoma, 1 with osteosarcoma, and 3 with  rhabdomyosarcoma.  CONCLUSIONS: MAID chemotherapy is an active regimen in adults with advanced or  metastatic Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Although there was no direct  comparison with a doxorubicin and cisplatin-based regimen, the response rate and  survival in patients with osteosarcoma suggest that doxorubicin and  cisplatin-based chemotherapy would remain the accepted initial chemotherapy  regimen.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. The context mentions that binding of Annexin V was used as a convenient marker for apoptotic cells.,"Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues, Context: glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content  after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma  membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology. The application of Annexin V labeling at electron microscopy will allow a more refined description of the  morphological events occurring during apoptosis, Context: activity. In this study, we evaluated the imaging properties of an  (111)In-labeled, long-circulating annexin V. METHODS: Both polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the metal chelator  diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were simultaneously introduced to  annexin V or ovalbumin through the use of a heterofunctional PEG precursor.  Imaging studies were performed in mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated human  mammary MDA-MB-468 tumors.

Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context mentions that Abf1 contributes to transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, but it does not mention anything about acting as an insulator.","Context: Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to  transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to  replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast. In spite of their  widespread roles in transcription, the scope of their functional targets  genome-wide has not been previously determined. Here, we use microarrays to  examine the contribution of these essential GRFs to transcription genome-wide,  by using ts mutants that dissociate from their binding sites at 37 degrees C. We  then combine this data with published ChIP-chip studies and motif analysis to  identify probable direct targets for Abf1 and Rap1. We also identify a substantial number of genes likely to bind Rap1 or Abf1, but not affected by  loss of GRF binding. Interestingly, the results strongly suggest that Rap1 can  contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can Abf1. Also, consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss  of binding than those that bind Rap1. Finally, we show for several such genes  that the Abf1 C-terminal region, which contains the putative activation domain,, Context: the fission yeast CENP-B homolog Abp1 plays an important role in preventing  pervasive transcription. We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation  of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway. These CUTs  originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase  corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the  entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is  observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is  enriched at rDNA repeats. Loss of abp1 also results in Tf2 derepression and  increased nucleolus size.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The decrease in T3 serves as an indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to increased mortality. However, I don't know if there's a specific relationship mentioned between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients.","Context: is decreased. Complex and interesting interactions occur between cardiac  hypertrophy induced by excess thyroid hormone action and cardiac hypertrophy  occurring with heart failure. The thyroid hormone mediated cardiac hypertrophy  in its initial phases presents a physiological hypertrophy with increases in  SERCa2 levels and decreased expression of MHC beta. In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy  which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart. In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In  addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the  frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. It was found to protect retinal ganglion cells from N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in mice.,"Context:  We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress. We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-Î± gene  expression.

In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative  stress.

Steady state  free radical concentration measured using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, reduced and oxidized glutathione ratio, thiobarbituric  acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyl levels of the red leg  muscle were measured. RESULTS: Free radical concentrations and glutathione composition of the tissue indicated that whey protein supplementation of the regular diet was able to  prevent oxidative stress regardless of training.

Moreover another curare molecule can  then block the curare-activated open channel, in line with previous results  concerning such a mode of action. In adult rat muscle, the partial agonist activity of curare can also be demonstrated, though it is much weaker than in  embryonic muscle. It is also shown that in adult muscle cell, the conductance of  the channel (activated either by ACh or by curare) is 50-60 pS, i.e., higher than in the myotubes (35 pS), Context: spectroscopy, reduced and oxidized glutathione ratio, thiobarbituric  acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyl levels of the red leg  muscle were measured. RESULTS: Free radical concentrations and glutathione composition of the tissue  indicated that whey protein supplementation of the regular diet was able to  prevent oxidative stress regardless of training. Soy protein supplementation  decreased TBARS only in the muscle of untrained animals, while training per se  lowered protein damage in all investigated groups. A mixture of soy and whey  protein supplementation resulted in leaner animals after training, but had no  synergistic effect on either of the measured redox parameters.
