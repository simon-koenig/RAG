What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it may play a role in tumor development, as shown by frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases and high levels of trimethylated H3K27","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,",23179372,"Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

Describe RIblast,I don't know the answer.,"Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),",22544737,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses is mentioned in the context as a form of integrating gene transfer vectors.,"Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,",21247248,"Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. They mostly arise by point mutations in known protein-coding genes.,"Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Cytoplasm.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome",22269667,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. The known genetic causes are a microdeletion at 16p13.3 or mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) at 22q13 (5%). Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.","7630403, 16359492, 22269667, 14974086, 18773673, 20684013, 23432975, 22303793, 15706485, 20689175, 22991675"
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,No. The context does not mention anything about yeast proteins or Abf1 acting as an insulator. It only discusses CTCF-like gene in Trichinella spiralis and its phylogenetic analysis with nematodes.,"Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead  operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes,",19712444,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417
