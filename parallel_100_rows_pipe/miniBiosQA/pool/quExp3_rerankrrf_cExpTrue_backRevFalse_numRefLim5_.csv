What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, the context indicates that histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Specifically, mutations in H3K27 demethylases are frequently observed in certain groups of medulloblast","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation., Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum","23179372, 19270706, 14688019, 14688019, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are lncRNAs regulated by Sam68. This information is provided in the context","Context: various biological processes. Since NONCODE version 3.0 was released 2 years  ago, discovery of novel ncRNAs has been promoted by high-throughput RNA  sequencing (RNA-Seq). In this update of NONCODE, we expand the ncRNA data set by  collection of newly identified ncRNAs from literature published in the last 2  years and integration of the latest version of RefSeq and Ensembl. Particularly,  the number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increased sharply from 73 327 to  210 831. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of  lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs. The 56  018 and 46 475 lncRNA genes were generated from 95 135 and 67 628 lncRNAs for human and mouse, respectively. Additionally, we present expression profile of  lncRNA genes by graphs based on public RNA-seq data for human and mouse, as well  as predict functions of these lncRNA genes. The improvements brought to the database also include an incorporation of an ID conversion tool from RefSeq or  Ensembl ID to NONCODE ID and a service of lncRNA identification. NONCODE is also  accessible through http://www.noncode.org/., Context: lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas  depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation., Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected.

Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation., Context: Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases pose severe threats to human  health worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that at least 50% of foam cells  in atheromas are derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); the first  step in this process involves migration to human atherosclerotic lesions. Long  non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play significant roles in diverse  biological processes. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in VSMCs. The expression of lncRNAs or mRNAs was detected using reverse  transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Gene Expression  Omnibus datasets in the NCBI portal were searched using the key words 'Atherosclerosis AND tissue AND Homo sapiens' and the GSE12288 dataset. Gene  expression in circulating leukocytes was measured to identify patients with  coronary artery disease (CAD) or controls, and used to analyze the correlation, Context: understanding of cellular processes and gene regulation, along with implications  for the treatment of human disease. The recent ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA  Elements) study reported 9,640 lncRNA loci in the human genome, which  corresponds to around half the number of protein-coding genes. Because of this  sheer number and their functional diversity, it is crucial to identify a pool of  potentially relevant lncRNAs early on in a given study. In this review, we  evaluate the methods for isolating lncRNAs by immunoprecipitation and review the  advantages, disadvantages, and applications of three widely used approaches -  microarray, tiling array, and RNA-seq - for identifying lncRNAs involved in gene regulation. We also look at ways in which data from publicly available databases  such as ENCODE can support the study of lncRNAs.","24285305, 29137239, 29137239, 34608503, 23126680","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis refers to a condition where the lens of the eye is not located in its normal position. It can be isolated or syndromal, with genetic alterations being a common cause. The most frequent molecular basis","Context: for ectopia lentis. Isolated ectopia lentis is frequently caused by genetic  alterations as well, most commonly due to mutations in ADAMTSL4. Depending on  the molecular basis, the consequences for the management of patients may differ  significantly: On the one hand, possible accompanying symptoms may require a  specific surveillance and treatment. Also, the risk for other family members to  develop ectopia lentis or accompanying symptoms can only be determined if the  genetic cause and thus inheritance pattern are known. This review describes the  different types and genetic causes of syndromal and isolated ectopia lentis as  well as possible consequences for the patients; also it presents a sensible algorithm for the molecular diagnostic approach., Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded for 48 family members including 24 persons with isolated ectopia lentis. Candidate gene  regions at 5q and 15q known to be linked with ectopia lentis were analyzed using  fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers. Mutation screening in the candidate gene, fibrillin-1 (FBN1), at 15q was performed by bidirectional sequencing of  the amplified products.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online., Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: recent developments in this area of study have been described in greater detail,  in particular the discovery of AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation of RNA  synthesized by RNA polymerase III, which has not been discussed previously. Data  on AAUAAA-independent polyadenylation catalyzed by noncanonical TRAMP  poly(A)-polymerases (Trf4 and Trf5) have been presented in the third section.  These enzymes promote rapid degradation of RNAs by adding a short poly(A) tail  to them. This mechanism enables the recognition, poly(A)-marking, and  elimination of incorrectly folded noncoding transcripts (e.g. ribosomal and  transfer RNAs)., Context: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized  by the presence of nucleic acid- and protein-targeting autoantibodies and an  aberrant type I IFN expression signature. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an  autosomal-recessive encephalopathy in children that is characterized by  mutations in numerous nucleic acid repair enzymes and elevated IFN levels.  Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads.","28459942, 28459942, 22544737, 28537233, 25500879","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, they target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that initiate sustained silencing via","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell  proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating  RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing., Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform.

We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough details about what a ""minimal genome build"" is. The concept of a ""minimal genome"" is discussed in the context, but it refers to the smallest set of genes necessary for life,","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced., Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell., Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 deposits H4 Lys 20 methylation (H4K20me) mark on histones. This is mentioned in the second paragraph of the context where it states that ""Hist","Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes., Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By  generating a modification-specific antibody and yeast strains that harbor  mutations in the putative site of methylation, we provide evidence that this  mark exist in vivo. Importantly, we show that this lysine residue is highly  conserved through evolution, and provide evidence that this methylation event  also occurs in higher eukaryotes.

This process is known as endoplasmic  reticulum-associated protein degradation. In order to become accessible to the  proteasome of this system substrates must first be retrogradely transported from  the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation. This export step seems to be accompanied by polyubiquitination of such  molecules. Surprisingly, protein dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum  seems to require at least some components that mediate import into this compartment. However, protein import and export display differences in the  mechanism that provides the driving force and ensures directionality.

Here,  we show that the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex allows the MCM (minichromosome  maintenance) helicase to interact with key regulatory proteins in large  replisome progression complexes (RPCs) that are assembled during initiation and  disassembled at the end of S phase. RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the  Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA  barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"Yes, avelumab has shown promising antitumor activity in patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) and has received accelerated US FDA approval based","Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma. Yet the challenge for clinicians is to  determine the optimal choice of agents as first-line or second-line therapy and  which offers the best chance for overall survival for the individual patient in this rapidly changing field., Context:  This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN  Guidelines) for Bladder Cancer focuses on systemic therapy for muscle-invasive  urothelial bladder cancer, as substantial revisions were made in the 2017 updates, such as new recommendations for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab,  durvalumab, and avelumab. The complete version of the NCCN Guidelines for  Bladder Cancer addresses additional aspects of the management of bladder cancer, including non-muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer and nonurothelial  histologies, as well as staging, evaluation, and follow-up., Context: unchanged for the last 20-30 years. Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and  its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown  promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and  PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could  potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical  efficacy., Context: (40 [16%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21  (8%) of 249 patients, the most common of which were fatigue (four [2%]), and  asthenia, elevated lipase, hypophosphataemia, and pneumonitis in two (1%)  patients each. 19 (8%) of 249 patients had a serious adverse event related to  treatment with avelumab, and one treatment-related death occurred (pneumonitis). INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients  with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety  profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients. These data provide the  rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis.

The median age of the patients was 56 years old (range,  28 to 71; male : female=30 : 3).  RESULTS: Overall survival was not correlated with age, sex, level of metastases,  preoperative Child-Pugh classification, preoperative ambulatory function,  preoperative radiotherapy, type of operation, administration of Sorafenib, or  the Tokuhashi scoring system. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an  independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Comparing the Child-Pugh  classification and ambulatory ability, there were no statistically differences between patients pre- and post-operatively.

The HER family includes transmembrane proteins that regulate","Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases. Likewise, the highest concentrations of this oncoprotein are found in patients with breast cancer, but lower concentrations  may be found in other malignancies, particularly ovarian, prostate and lung  cancer (mainly adenocarcinomas). HER-2/neu assay sensitivity in patients with, Context: trastuzumab-like IgG. For simplification and to avoid methodological limitations  of synthesis and coupling chemistry, we herewith present a novel and optimized  approach by using adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as effective and high-density  mimotope-display system, which can be directly used for vaccination. METHODS: An AAV capsid display library was constructed by genetically  incorporating random peptides in a plasmid encoding the wild-type AAV2 capsid  protein. AAV clones, expressing peptides specifically reactive to trastuzumab,  were employed to immunize BALB/c mice. Antibody titers against human HER-2 were  determined, and the isotype composition and functional properties of these were tested. Finally, prophylactically immunized mice were challenged with human  HER-2 transfected mouse D2F2/E2 cells. RESULTS: HER-2 mimotope AAV-vaccines induced antibodies specific to human HER-2. Two clones were selected for immunization of mice, which were subsequently  grafted D2F2/E2 cells. Both mimotope AAV clones delayed the growth of tumors  significantly, as compared to controls., Context: imaged breast cancer cases enriched with equivocally scored (2+) cases. Image  features are generated based on the staining profile of the positive control  tissue and pixels delineated by a newly developed Membrane Isolation Algorithm.  Evaluation of results was performed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)  analysis. RESULTS: A computer-aided diagnostic approach has been developed using a  membrane isolation algorithm and quantitative use of positive immunostaining  controls. By incorporating internal positive controls into feature analysis a  greater Area Under the Curve (AUC) in ROC analysis was achieved than feature  analysis without positive controls. Evaluation of HER2 immunostaining that utilized membrane pixels, controls, and percent area stained showed  significantly greater AUC than manual scoring, and significantly less false  positive rate when used to evaluate immunohistochemically equivocal cases.

Which is the protein encoded by the human gene GRIK?,"Yes, GRIK is a family of genes that encode for kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors. Specifically, GRIK3 encodes for a principal subunit of this type of receptor.","Context: Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with  severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West  syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and  nonsyndromic epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we  identified a novel single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT  (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of the STXBP1 gene. This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with neonatal-onset focal seizures broadens the spectrum  of clinically relevant human disorders caused by STXBP1 mutations., Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression  pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in  presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of  genetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members  support this hypothesis. The current observation of a microdeletion involving, Context: BACKGROUND: Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is  approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors  overexpress Her2 (erbB2/neu). Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential  component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells,  including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its  amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We determined expression of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in  BT/Her(R) cells selected for resistance to Herceptin.

To better define the biological function of  these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and  assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of  all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous  analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We  find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1,  class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently  identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group ""class 4"" to distinguish  it from the unrelated ""class 3"" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms  contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of  HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC  proteins.

Patients were randomised to receive chemotherapy according to the FEC  regimen (5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 500 mg/m2, epidoxorubicin (EPI) 75 mg/m2 and  cyclophosphamide (CFA) 500 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.). every 3 weeks) or the EM  regimen (EPI 75 mg/m2, i.v. every 3 weeks; mitomycin C (MMC) 10 mg/m2, i.v. every 6 weeks) or the same regimens with the addition of lonidamine (LND) until  disease progression (orally, thrice daily, 150+150+300 mg); a maximum of eight  chemotherapy cycles were planned. The aim of the trial was 2-fold: to compare the EM regimen with the commonly used FEC regimen and to evaluate the possible  role of the addition of LND. Patients were eligible if they had histologically  proven breast carcinoma, metastatic or locoregional relapse with measurable, Context: OBJECTIVES: Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be  effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including  B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. We  undertook a phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of  alemtuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced stage cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of eight patients were enrolled, seven with  mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS) and one with large-cell transformation  of MF. Seven patients had disease refractory to multiple previous therapies.  Alemzumab (30 mg) was administered intravenously three times per week for 12 wk or until maximum response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 38%, with three patients achieving  partial remission, two patients with stable disease and three patients with progressive disease (PD) during treatment. The time to progression was short,  with all patients developing PD within 4 months of starting alemtuzumab.  Response duration in the three PR patients was also brief, with responses, Context: BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic that has shown efficacy in  ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We studied the  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a new  formulation of vedolizumab produced by an improved manufacturing process. METHODS: UC patients were randomized to receive vedolizumab (2, 6, or 10 mg/kg)  or placebo on days 1, 15, 29, and 85. Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity evaluations were performed at multiple  timepoints through day 253. Partial Mayo Scores and fecal calprotectin levels  were used to assess efficacy. RESULTS: In all, 46 patients (9 placebo, 37 vedolizumab) received at least one  dose of study medication. The vedolizumab serum concentration declined  monoexponentially until concentrations reached 1-10 μg/mL, and then fell","33023473, 32266704, 10885599, 12950233, 22147460",Eptinezumab is administered intravenously.,32266704
Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, based on the context, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. This is mentioned in the second and third contexts where it is stated that recombinant Bax was used to induce apoptosis in isolated","Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis., Context:  BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. However, it  remains unclear by what mechanism BAX is triggered to initiate apoptosis. Here,  we reveal the mechanism using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. An inactive BAX monomer was found to exhibit conformational heterogeneity and exist  at equilibrium in two conformations, one of which has never been reported. We  show that upon apoptotic stimulus by BH3-only peptides, BAX can be induced to convert into either a ligand-bound monomer or an oligomer through a  conformational selection mechanism. The kinetics of reaction is studied by means  of time-resolved ESR, allowing a direct in situ observation for the, Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

How is Hsd17b1 associated with endometriosis?,"Yes, in the study, Hsd17b1 was found to be associated with endometriosis. Specifically, individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of HSD1","Context: METHODS: All participants underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, and the stage of  endometriosis was determined according to the Revised American Fertility Society  classification. Of the 138 women enrolled, 59 had no endometriosis, 21 had stage  I, 10 had stage II, 23 had stage III and 25 had stage IV. SNPs were  discriminated by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. RESULTS: Individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of  HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype:  adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI  1.08-8.43). There was a significant trend associating A/G + A/A genotypes with severity of endometriosis (P for trend < 0.01). No statistically significant  association was found for the CYP19 polymorphism.

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in  HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of  HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis., Context: NK and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and its genetic polymorphisms were tested in  endometriosis. We found that median Granzyme B levels were significantly  different in patients with the GG genotype in the control group, compared to  those with the AA and AG genotype. However, this difference was not detected  between the control and endometriosis groups.What are the implications of these  findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our results contribute  to uncovering the pathogenesis of endometriosis since there are no previous  studies in the literature regarding this topic. Although we did not find a  difference, our results will inform further studies made on this topic. Studies with different molecules and an increased number of patients are needed. The  immune defect of endometriosis may not be due exclusively to Granzyme B. Other  mediators that are secreted from immune cells may have mutual effects and  interactions., Context: data has revealed strong candidates for the causal SNPs within these critical  regions; however, the molecular pathogenesis of these SNPs is currently unknown.  We used gene expression data collected from whole blood from 862 individuals and  endometrial tissue from 136 individuals from independent populations of European  descent to examine the mechanism underlying endometriosis susceptibility.  Association mapping results from 7,090 individuals (2,594 cases and 4,496  controls) supported rs3820282 as the SNP with the strongest association for  endometriosis risk (P = 1.84 × 10−5, OR = 1.244 (1.126-1.375)). SNP rs3820282 is  a significant eQTL in whole blood decreasing expression of LINC00339 (also known as HSPC157) and increasing expression of CDC42 (P = 2.0 ×10−54 and 4.5x10−4  respectively). The largest effects were for two LINC00339 probes (P = 2.0  ×10−54; 1.0 × 10−34). The eQTL for LINC00339 was also observed in endometrial tissue (P = 2.4 ×10−8) with the same direction of effect for both whole blood  and endometrial tissue.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, MALAT-1 is upregulated in some cancers. In bladder cancer tissues, MALAT-1 levels were found to be higher compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, MALAT-1 expression","Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation.

Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology.

Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. During epidermal, Context: The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological  function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse,  fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase  chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have  been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These  models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship  between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in  genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of  three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.  Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse  genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin  interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive  structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with","29522506, 24346698, 25990738, 24346698, 22495300","Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation.

The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not associated with thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. Instead, TR alpha1 may have a compensatory role in maintaining normal functions of thy","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome.

Efficacy and safety have been  tested for rivaroxaban and apixaban in large study programmes with more than  60'000 patients each. For edoxaban large phase III studies are under way. Based on these data rivaroxaban was registered in the EU and CH for primary  prophylaxis against thrombosis after major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip- and  knee-joint protheses, for treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and for prophylaxis against thromboembolic stroke in patients  with atrial fibrillation.

Given their ease of use, it is expected that these drugs  would be widely used in such long-term indications. Beyond their effectiveness, these treatments remain anticoagulant drugs, potentially responsible for  bleeding complications, and specific measures should be defined in case of  occurrence of such complications., Context:  Apixaban (Eliquis™), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being developed by  Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer as a therapy for the prevention and/or treatment  of thrombotic disorders.

A number  of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in  atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin).  Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval  of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis.  Antifungals may be helpful in the variant of head and neck dermatitis associated, Context: understanding of the immunological pathogenesis of psoriasis have led to the  development of new biologic therapies, targeting specific inflammatory cytokines  upregulated in psoriasis. These include the IL-17 antagonists, secukinumab,  brodalumab and ixekizumab; the IL-23 antagonists, guselkumab and tildrakizumab;  and the oral small molecule therapies, tofacitinib and apremilast. Here, we  review evidence for the efficacy and safety of these novel psoriasis therapies,  providing clinicians with an overview of the next era in immunotherapy for  psoriasis., Context: siltuximab, and ramucirumab, as well as the Fc fusion proteins Factor IX-Fc and  Factor VIII-Fc; and the submission of first marketing applications for up to  five therapeutics (secukinumab, ch14.18, onartuzumab, necitumumab, gevokizumab).  Antibody therapeutics in Phase 3 studies are described, with an emphasis on  those with study completion dates in 2014, including antibodies targeting  interleukin-17a or the interleukin-17a receptor (secukinumab, ixekizumab,  brodalumab), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (alirocumab,  evolocumab, bococizumab), and programmed death 1 receptor (lambrolizumab,  nivolumab).

Rates of 70% improvement were not  significantly higher in the brodalumab groups. Similar degrees of improvement  were noted among patients who had received previous biologic therapy and those  who had not received such therapy. At week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the  brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups were 51% and 64%, respectively, as compared  with 44% among patients who switched from placebo to open-label brodalumab;  responses were sustained through week 52. At week 12, serious adverse events had  occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the  placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab significantly improved response rates among patients with psoriatic arthritis. Larger studies of longer duration are necessary to  assess adverse events.

Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints.

What do studies show about the effect of Induced hypothermia in premature babies?,"Yes, studies suggest that induced hypothermia can be both feasible and safe for certain conditions in premature babies. A study on newborns with HIE at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age showed positive results","Context: INTRODUCTION: Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia  for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term or  late preterm infants. In August 2006, the Neonatology Department at  Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, introduced total body cooling for infants born at  term with HIE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprises data from medical  records of newborn children born with HIE during a period of 32 months. Relevant  data for cooling were recorded. Structured neurological examinations were  carried out on survivors when they were ten and or 18 months old. RESULTS: A total of 32 infants fulfilled the criteria for cooling, the incidence being 0.4/1000 births. Twenty infants were cooled for 72 hours. Eleven infants  had cooling discontinued before 72 hours because of their grave prognosis. One  infant had cooling discontinued because of pulmonary hypertension. Most infants were cooled before six hours of age (median four hours). The mortality rate was  41%. A total of 45% were cooled without being placed in a ventilator. The side  effects were of no major concern.

We present a case of therapeutic whole body  cooling in a baby at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with HIE., Context: OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with multiple organ dysfunction  syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality. There is extensive  experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in  infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety  of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a  randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants  who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at  least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress. Three groups (n = 5 per group) were  cooled to core temperatures of 35.5 degrees C (+/-0.5 degrees C), 34.5 degrees  C, and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, for 48 hours before rewarming to 37 degrees, Context: Statistically significant relationships were identified between core temperature  and heart rate (P < .0001), pH (P < .0001), base excess (P = .003), and blood  clot dynamics (longer time to initial clot formation, slower rate of clot  formation, and decrease in clot strength; all P < .001) as assessed by  thromboelastography. No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted  during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no  increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who  were cooled. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC  seems both feasible and safe.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat is telomerase. This is stated explicitly in the second and third contexts provided, where it is mentioned that imetelstat is a ""telomerase inhibitor","Context: the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program  illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced  definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in  the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target  disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for  druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene,  protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism  of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging  integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,  drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths., Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy., Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context: inactivation of the resulting proteins by BG or 5-nitroso-BP. Chimeric  alkyltransferase proteins were made in which the residues on the amino side of  the cysteine acceptor site came from Ada-C and the residues on the carboxyl side  came from AGT and vice versa but these did not show sensitivity to BG suggesting  that resistance is produced by residues in both segments of the protein.  Analysis of the Ada-C mutant proteins revealed two sites for mutations that  confer sensitivity to these inhibitors. One of these was tryptophan-336 and the  other was residues lysine-314 and alanine-316. Thus, when the combined mutations  of A316P/W336A were made in the Ada-C sequence, the protein was sensitive to inactivation by BG. This A316P/W336A mutant protein was even more sensitive to  5-nitroso-BP and the mutant proteins W336A, K314P/A316P and A316P could also be  inhibited by this drug (in decreasing order of sensitivity) although the control Ada-C and a mutant R335S were not inhibited. These results provide strong  support for the hypothesis that the resistance of the Ada-C alkyl-transferase is  due to a steric effect limiting access to the active site.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two major symptoms associated with Aagenaes syndrome. They are lymphedema of the lower extremities and cholestasis (recurrent infections).","Context: OBJECTIVES: As the disease can display different clinical presentations, which  are mainly unspecific, and considering the importance of an early diagnosis and  the proper and early management of it, this study was carried out to present a  general overview of VHL. Moreover, the present article reviews screening methods  and emphasizes the need for increasing the awareness of different health care  professionals to diagnose and refer the patients in the early stages.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of internet medical databases, such as  PubMed, was carried out on known or suggested; clinical presentations,  pathogenesis, screening, causes and criteria for diagnosis of patients and their  referrals. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that VHL is caused by a mutation in the von  Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. It also showed that different screening methods can be  utilized for the early diagnosis and referral of patients. Different clinical presentations of the disease are also elaborated in some detail and their  treatment options are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the need for a multidisciplinary approach to VHL,, Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome., Context: tumors. We report, a 14-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of  aplastic anemia (AA). Subsequent bone marrow examination and multiparametric  flowcytometric immunophenotyping revealed an evolving hypoplastic acute myeloid  leukemia. Chromosomal breakage studies using clastogenic agent mitomycin C  showed 88% stress induced chromosomal/chromatid breaks, gaps and rearrangements  revealing an underlying FA. The case emphasizes upon the role of a systematic  clinico-investigative approach in diagnosing such patients who by clinical  criteria appear to have idiopathic AA and appear phenotypically normal. A timely  and accurate diagnosis becomes vital in these cases to implement appropriate  therapy., Context: Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of  inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for  a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative  disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders  (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4)  Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant  Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO). Due to the clinical heterogeneity,  time-dependent evolution of symptoms, overlapping phenotypes, and inconsistencies in muscle pathology findings, definitive diagnosis relies on the  molecular finding of deleterious mutations.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 has an effect on chromatin by regulating its compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains. However, this compaction and gene repression are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context: PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the  anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and  human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival. RESULTS: We detected nuclear overexpression of EZH2 in pancreatic cancer cell  lines and in 71 of 104 (68%) cases of human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. EZH2  nuclear accumulation was more frequent in poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinomas (31 of 34 cases; P<0.001). We found that genetic depletion of  EZH2 results in reexpression of p27(Kip1) and decreased pancreatic cancer cell  proliferation. Moreover, we showed that EZH2 depletion sensitized pancreatic, Context: non-PCSCs. The association between EZH2 function and PCSC growth was  investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Cell growth was  investigated by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis of PCSCs were explored by flow  cytometric analysis. Finally, the upstream pathway miRNA level was determined  via a luciferase reporter assay, and the downstream pathway cycle regulators  were examined via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results  showed that LNcap cell line comprised a greater proportion of CD44+/CD133+ cells  by comparison to the PC-3 cell line. EZH2 was up-regulated in PCSCs compared  with non-PCSCs. Silence of EZH2 inhibited cell growth and the cell cycle and promoted the progression of apoptosis. Furthermore, EZH2 was a direct target of  miR-101 in PCSCs and EZH2's mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-101  expression and cyclin E2 (a cell-cycle regulator) was suppressed by siEZH2. In conclusion, EZH2 is essential for PCSC growth, partly through a negative  regulation by miR-101 and positively regulating cyclin E2., Context: Overexpression of the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2  (EZH2) has been found in several malignancies, including prostate cancer, with  an aggressive phenotype. Amplification of the gene has previously been  demonstrated in several malignancies, but not in prostate cancer. Our goal was  to evaluate the gene copy number and expression alterations of EZH2 in prostate  cancer. The copy number of EZH2 in cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, 22Rv1), xenografts (n = 10), and clinical tumors (n = 191) was studied with fluorescence  in situ hybridization. All cell lines had a gain of EZH2. Eight of the ten  xenografts showed an increased copy number of the gene, including one case of high-level amplification (>or=5 copies of the gene and EZH2/centromere ratio  >or=2). 34/125 (27%) of untreated prostate carcinomas showed increased copy  number, but only one case of low-level amplification (>or=5 copies of the gene, Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling.

This means that only one copy of the mutated gene, inherited from either parent, is sufficient to cause the disorder.","Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg.

This review will highlight our current understanding and future research  directions. RECENT FINDINGS: FSHD typically results from contraction of a critical number of  D4Z4 repeats in a macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4q35. Contraction  leads to loss of DNA methylation and heterochromatin markers in the 4q35 D4Z4 region, resulting in relaxation of the chromatin structure and release of DUX4  repression. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally  epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.

In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: BACKGROUND: Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine  class. It has limited effects on myocardial contractility; is available in a  powder-filled capsule and has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours.  METHODS: Pharmacy records were reviewed to identify pediatric patients who had  received isradipine. The following demographic data were obtained: age, weight,  sex, underlying medical problems, and initial blood pressure values. Information  concerning isradipine included the initial dose and its interval, subsequent  dose escalations, blood pressure response to the medication, and duration of  therapy. RESULTS: The study population comprised 12 patients, ranging in age from 10 days to 11 years. The etiology of the hypertension was renal in 9 cases and nonrenal  in 3. Initial dosing with isradipine was 0.1 mg/kg/dose. Six patients had  emergent hypertension, and their blood pressure had been controlled with intravenous nicardipine before oral isradipine. Six patients received initial  therapy with oral isradipine. Isradipine was monotherapy in 7 patients and in  combination with other agents in 5 patients. The dose of isradipine required for, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner., Context: depression increased significantly after isradipine at 3 hours post 0800 hour  dose compared to placebo (87 vs. 7 seconds, p < 0.01) but not at the 0, 8, or  12-hour postdose time points, regardless of which baseline was used. Isradipine  therapy did not affect the rate-pressure double product. A significant  correlation between the mean increase in total exercise time and mean plasma  isradipine concentration was also present (p = 0.0295).

A synonymous sequence variation in PDGFRA (CCG to CCA; PRO 567  PRO) was detected in two cases (approximately 7%), but not in 150 normal  chromosomes assessed, suggesting that the PDGFRA locus may be associated with  medulloblastoma development in certain cases. No evidence for oncogenic  mutations affecting NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or PDFRFB was found in any case.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines. It also  attenuated MB cell migration, a pre-requirement for invasion. When used in  combination, LB100 enhanced cisplatin-mediated cytotoxic effects. Cell viability in the presence of 1 uM cisplatin alone was 61% (DAOY), 100% (D341), and 58%  (D283), but decreased with the addition of 2 μM of LB100 to 26% (DAOY), 67%  (D341), and 27% (D283), (p < 0.005). LB100 suppressed phosphorylation of the, Context: treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor  of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction  by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro. The antitumor effects of combining LB-100  with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the  radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic  assays. LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by γ-H2AX), mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated  meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of  its downstream proteins. In vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the, Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

One patient stopped treatment after one dose because of an acute infection and was reenrolled after recovery; each  course was analyzed as a separate patient entry. Two patients had dose-limiting  toxicity (reversible increases in serum creatinine or calculated serum, Context: multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle  specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts  directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic  regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating  formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and  independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and  phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex  dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance  in the β-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein  20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L)  result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.

This information is provided in the context as it mentions that ceritinib is an investig","Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase, Context: Ceritinib is a highly selective inhibitor of an important cancer target,  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Because it is an investigational compound,  there is a need to develop a robust and reliable analytical method for its  quantitative determination in human plasma. Here, we report the validation of a  liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid  quantification of ceritinib in human plasma. The method consists of protein precipitation with acetonitrile, and salting-out assisted liquid-liquid  extraction (SALLE) using a saturated solution of sodium chloride prior to  analysis by LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) technique in positive mode.

Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, based on the context, there exists a deep learning system that outperforms some dermatologists in detecting melanoma using dermoscopy images. This was demonstrated in a study where the deep learning system achieved a higher accuracy","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02).

LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a computational tool called SSCprofiler was used to predict novel miRNA precursors. It's based on Profile Hidden Markov Models and integrates sequence, structure, and conservation information. The trained classifier","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: oncogenes, whose loss or overexpression respectively has diagnostic and  prognostic significance. It seems that microRNAs act as major regulators of gene  expression. In this review, we discuss microRNAs' role in cancer and how  microRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their gene targets.  Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites has indicated several  novel potential gene targets involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastatic  mechanisms. Matching computational prediction analysis together with microarray  data seems the best method for microRNA gene target identification. MicroRNAs  together with transcription factors generate a complex combinatorial code regulating gene expression. Thus, manipulation of microRNA-transcription factor  gene networks may be provides a novel approach for developing cancer therapies., Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: evident, especially with the discovery that about 97% of the transcriptional  output in higher organisms are represented as noncoding RNAs: rRNA, snoRNAs,  tRNA, transposable elements, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, intergenic  regions and microRNAs. MicroRNAs function by negatively regulating gene  expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs and  thus participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular  processes including: development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and  apoptosis pathways. MicroRNA expression profiles in many types of cancers have  been identified. Recent reports have revealed that the expression profiles of microRNAs change in various human cancers and appear to function as oncogenes or  tumor suppressors. Abnormal microRNA expression has increasingly become a common  feature of human cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the involvement of microRNAs in different types of cancer and their potential  use as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers in the future.","21406606, 19324892, 19721809, 20221895, 23407615","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

This consensus sequence is directly involved in cleavage and polyadenylation at a site 20 nucleotides downstream of its location.","Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation., Context: present in the 2092 nucleotide interval. The first one functions as the major  polyA signal, directing cleavage and polyadenylation at a site 20 nucleotides  downstream. Within 41 nucleotides downstream of the major membrane polyA signal  are two sequences with 75% homology to the consensus sequence,  (C/T)GTGTT(C/T)(C/T), identified by McLauchlan et al. [Nucl. Acids Res. 13,  1347-1365 (1985)]. An 80% homology match to the Berget consensus sequence,  CA(C/T)TG, begins five nucleotides 3' of the major polyA site (used 20 times  more than the second, downstream polyA site) [Berget Nature 309, 179-182  (1984)]. The second AATAAA, located 73 nucleotides 3' of the first, directs cleavage and polyadenylation 18 nucleotides downstream at a minor polyA site.  One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site.

In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites. These experiments indicate that inactivation of the major early polyadenylation signal is not sufficient to induce expression  of the BPV late genes in transformed mouse cells.","19032167, 2513486, 2513486, 2513486, 7901430","Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation.

Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome., Context: the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate  results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker. It binds to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces, which is a reliable indicator of apoptosis widely used in flow cytometry-based assays. In","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context:  The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces  is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based  apoptosis assays. In this paper, we report a new class of Annexin V-based probes for apoptosis. Luciferase from Renilla reniformis (RLuc) was linked to Annexin V  and expressed successfully in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of, Context: reliability of this method. By comparing the comet assay with a flow cytometry  method that uses Annexin V binding to apoptotic cells, we have provided further  evidence for evaluating the usefulness of the comet assay for detecting  apoptosis.  METHODS: Apoptosis was induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) by ionizing radiation and measured using the comet assay and a flow  cytometry method that measures Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining.  RESULTS: The Annexin V flow cytometry assay distinguished among early apoptosis,  late apoptosis, and an apoptotic or necrotic phase in which the cells were  labeled with both Annexin V and PI. The comet assay detected only the latter two phases of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The comet assay is a useful tool for measuring the late stages of  apoptosis whereas the Annexin V assay measures higher amounts of apoptosis  because it can detect cells in an earlier stage of the apoptotic pathway., Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF  expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells.","16331047, 23000925, 12116376, 7622868, 16737615","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"
Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any ultraconserved element associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context: Heart failure is a major health problem on a global scale. Current therapies  include drug treatments, lifestyle modification, device therapy and heart  transplantation. However, the ""holy grail"" of heart failure treatment would be  to achieve widespread regeneration of diseased cardiac tissue. Examples of  regeneration of living tissue are present in nature and involve stem cells. The  two key defining properties of stem cells are their ability to renew themselves through cell division and to differentiate into various cell types. Generally,  stem cells can be classified into embryonic or adult forms. Human adult stem  cells are ethically appealing and have already been used in clinical trials in a variety of disease states. Bone marrow derived stem cells, skeletal myoblasts  and resident adult cardiac stem cells are being explored as potential cell types  for heart failure treatment. These cells can be delivered to the heart via a, Context:  Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent the naïve ground state of the  preimplantation epiblast and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) represent the primed  state of the postimplantation epiblast. Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous  and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to  differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite  considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and  pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here, Context:  For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related, Context:  Embryonic stem (ES) cells offer insight into early developmental fate decisions,  and their controlled differentiation may yield vast regenerative potential. The  molecular determinants supporting ES cell self-renewal are incompletely understood. The homeodomain proteins Nanog and Oct4 are essential for mouse ES  cell self-renewal. Using a high-throughput approach, we discovered DNaseI  hypersensitive sites and potential regulatory elements along a 160-kb region of the genome that includes GDF3, Dppa3, and Nanog. We analyzed gene expression,  chromatin occupancy, and higher-order chromatin structure throughout this gene  locus and found that expression of the reprogramming factor Oct4 is required to, Context: When embryonic stem cells are allowed to aggregate, the outer layer of the  aggregated spheres (referred to as embryoid bodies) differentiates into  primitive endoderm. This initial specification of cell lineage facilitates  further differentiation of the inner mass of the embryoid bodies. These  processes are considered to recapitulate early embryonic development from the  blastocyst stage to the egg-cylinder stage. Formation of the primitive endoderm  layer in the embryoid bodies was induced solely by aggregation of embryonic stem  cells, in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor/STAT3 and serum/BMP4, which  were considered to be sufficient for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Interestingly, cell aggregation by itself induced Nanog repression at the outer  layer, which was essential for aggregation-induced primitive endoderm formation.  These data illustrate aggregation-based cell-fate specification during early embryonic development, when downregulation of Nanog plays a crucial role.","19022705, 23154415, 21589869, 18283123, 15494369","Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.

CONCLUSION: The 420 C/G Polymorphism were associated with obesity and Leptin  concentration in our population., Context: little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we show that an  RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation,  thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts  (MEFs). Loss of HuR results in premature senescence, with concomitant increases  in p19(ARF) but not p16(Ink4a) levels, and this senescence is not observed in  ARF-null MEFs that retain an intact Ink4a locus. HuR depletion does not alter  ARF transcription or stability but enhances ribosome association with ARF mRNA.  Under these conditions, ARF mRNA accumulates in nucleoli, where it associates  with nucleolin. Furthermore, adipose-specific deletion of the HuR gene results in increased p19(ARF) expression in aged animals, which is accompanied by  decreased insulin sensitivity. Together, our findings demonstrate that p19(ARF)  is also regulated at the translational level, and this translational regulation restrains the cellular life span and tissue functions in vivo.","27822311, 27822311, 27822311, 28393393, 23508105",MIR137 is the key gene mediator of the syndromic obesity phenotype of patients with 1p21. 3 microdeletions.,"22003227, 27822311"

A  variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent  seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit  composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and  loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of  antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure  mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR  function, led to the development of ganaxolone.

What is included in the LACE Index?,"Yes, the LACE index includes four parameters. These are: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months.","Context: Predictive models for hospital readmission rates are in high demand because of  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Readmission  Reduction Program (HRRP). The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching  status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows  analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes., Context: patients from this group and modified the final model into an index scoring  system, the LACE+ index.

In addition to the variables  included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission  [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before  admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded, Context: of LACE Index for Readmission - Length of stay (days), Acute (emergent)  admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of ED visits within six months  (LACE) and Patients At Risk of Hospital Readmission (PARR) using New Zealand  hospital admissions. This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542., Context: status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is evident as patients with cells that display an increased frequency of recombination have an elevated frequency of cancer. Additionally, genes and proteins related to the","Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context: cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,  antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit","12488587, 20298636, 12427531, 23678008, 23675572",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki include salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1.

Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Exploring the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration is one of the main  challenges in biology and biomedicine. Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway., Context: The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating (Yaa) locus drives the transition to fatal  lupus nephritis when combined with B6.Sle1 in our C57BL/6J (B6)-congenic model  of systemic autoimmunity. We and others recently demonstrated that the  translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the  genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In  male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the  translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X  chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To  confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed  a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our  results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is  responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the","11528505, 22101275, 17980593, 21338344, 18521959",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

It is expected that the illness will affect  about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current  Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable  of slowing down disease progression.

Gantenerumab is an investigational fully  human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and  remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.

In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required.

This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution  based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of  protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different  algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated  using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying  complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and  combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total  >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported  proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported  proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of  search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The  results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying, Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins. All alpha-Kaps contain a central domain composed  of eight approximately 40 amino acid, tandemly arranged, armadillo-like (Arm)  repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.

Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: Now that complete genome sequences are available for a variety of organisms, the  elucidation of potential gene products function is a central goal in the  post-genome era. Domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the  functional association of the component proteins. Here, we took a new approach  to the analysis of the structural features of the proteins involved in fusion  events. An exhaustive survey of fusion events within 30 completely sequenced  genomes and subsequent structure annotations to the component proteins at a SCOP  superfamily level with hidden Markov models was carried out. A domain fusion map  was then constructed. The results revealed that proteins with the class alpha/beta fold are frequently involved in fusion events, around 86% of the  total 676 assigned single-domain fusion pairs including at least one component  protein belonging to the alpha/beta fold class. Moreover, the domain fusion map in our work may offer an attractive framework for designing chimeric enzymes  following Nature's lead, and may give useful hints for exploring the  evolutionary history of proteins.

Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation.

Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females).

On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials,  bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile., Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression).

RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).

In vitro, carbidopa,  benserazide and NSD-1015 all potently inhibited hepatic MAO A and B activity  (IC(50) 10-50 micro M). In ex vivo studies following systemic drug  administration, NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg ip) produced 88% and 96% inhibition of  hepatic and striatal MAO A and B activity respectively. Carbidopa (12.5 mg/kg  i.p.) and benserazide (50 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on striatal MAO A activity or hepatic MAO B activity. However, they inhibited striatal MAO B activity by 45  +/- 10% and 36 +/- 10% respectively. In conclusion, carbidopa and benserazide  may not only protect L-DOPA from peripheral decarboxylation, but also increase striatal dopamine content through MAO inhibition.

These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. This is suggested by the fact that methods allowing the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in the tumour can be used to accelerate the","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with  the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question  the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs., Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"No, evolocumab does not target an enzyme. Instead, it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies  inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it  for degradation. Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show  that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly  limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and, Context: A model to quantitatively characterize the effect of evinacumab, an  investigational monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3  (ANGPTL3) on lipid trafficking is needed. A quantitative systems pharmacology  (QSP) approach was developed to predict the transient responses of different  triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles in response to evinacumab  administration. A previously published hepatic lipid model was modified to  address specific queries relevant to the mechanism of evinacumab and its effect  on lipid metabolism. Modifications included the addition of intermediate-density  lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein compartments to address the modulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by evinacumab, ANGPTL3 biosynthesis and  clearance, and a target-mediated drug disposition model. A sensitivity analysis  guided the creation of virtual patients (VPs). The drug-free QSP model was found to agree well with clinical data published with the initial hepatic liver model  over simulations ranging from 20 to 365 days in duration. The QSP model,  including the interaction between LPL and ANGPTL3, was validated against, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues.

Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms. We compared the results of the different methods by  applying five different performance measurement metrices. Moreover, the  parameters of the methods that constitute the filter have been checked on how, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization., Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding  that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for  cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell  lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response, Context: METHODS: We report here the making of MRG002, a novel HER2-targeted antibody  drug conjugate (ADC), and preclinical characterization including pharmacology,  pharmacodynamics and toxicology and discuss its potential as a novel agent for  treating patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. RESULTS: MRG002 exhibited similar antigen binding affinity but much reduced  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity compared to  trastuzumab. In addition to potent in vitro cytotoxicity, MRG002 showed tumor  regression in both high- and medium-to-low HER2 expressing in vivo xenograft  models. Furthermore, MRG002 showed enhanced antitumor activity when used in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Main findings from toxicology studies  are related to the payload and are consistent with literature report of other  ADCs with monomethyl auristatinE. CONCLUSION: MRG002 has demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and potent  antitumor activities in the breast and gastric PDX models with varying levels of  HER2 expression, and/or resistance to trastuzumab or T-DM1. A phase I clinical, Context: Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein  (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief  that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk,  stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly  characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets  only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP  granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and  adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for  cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct  responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific  RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified. Previously underappreciated, transcriptome  profiling in the RG may contribute to understanding human diseases associated  with RNP dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.","22015969, 30194269, 23400593, 34532642, 29576526",BFKB8488A is a bispecific antibody against FGFR1 and KLB.,33139537

We  explored the risk factors and outcomes of seizures after intracerebral  haemorrhage and if tranexamic acid increased the risk of seizures in the  Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seizures were reported prospectively up to day 90. Cox  regression analyses were used to determine the predictors of seizures within  90 days and early seizures (≤7 days). We explored the effect of early seizures  on day 90 outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2325 patients recruited, 193 (8.3%) had seizures including 163  (84.5%) early seizures and 30 (15.5%) late seizures (>7 days).

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, the lectin complement pathway is activated by ficolin-3. This is stated in the context where it mentions that ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway and forms complexes with","Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern.

Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has  been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of  Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common  pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause  extraintestinal, opportunistic infections., Context: prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The  following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World  Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as  neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral  ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and  6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.  RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with  controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was  reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia.  Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with  unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain  injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters. These results support  the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to, Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins.

The context discusses various topics related to gene regulation and transcription factors but does not mention any resource for","Context: directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to  1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.  Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible  genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among  them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6., Context: abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two  coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: The ubiquitous transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is known to have a  fundamental role in normal biologic processes such as embryogenesis,  differentiation, replication, and cellular proliferation. YY1 exerts its effects  on genes involved in these processes via its ability to initiate, activate, or  repress transcription depending upon the context in which it binds. Mechanisms  of action include direct activation or repression, indirect activation or repression via cofactor recruitment, or activation or repression by disruption  of binding sites or conformational DNA changes. YY1 activity is regulated by  transcription factors and cytoplasmic proteins that have been shown to abrogate or completely inhibit YY1-mediated activation or repression; however, these  mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Since expression and function of  YY1 are known to be intimately associated with progression through phases of the, Context: stable stem-loop RNA structure and consequently are candidates for novel  regulatory elements, whereas some conserved noncoding elements are shown to  correlate with specific gene expression profiles. The SynapseDB online database  integrates these findings and other functional genomic resources for synaptic  genes. CONCLUSION: Highly conserved elements in nonprotein coding regions of 150  presynaptic genes represent sequences that may be involved in the  transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. Furthermore,  comparative sequence analysis will facilitate selection of genes and noncoding  sequences for future functional studies and analysis of variation studies in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders., Context: Immune responses to invading pathogens are mediated largely through a family of  transmembrane Toll-like receptors and modulated by a number of downstream  effectors. In particular, a family of four interleukin 1 receptor-associated  kinases (IRAK) regulates responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins. Pharmacological  targeting of particular IRAK components may be beneficial for treatment of  bacterial infections. Here, we studied transcriptional regulation of the human IRAK2 gene. Analysis of the IRAK2 promoter region reveals putative binding sites  for several transcriptional factors, including ZIP (EGR1 and SP1), CTCF and  AP-2beta. Deletion of the ZIP or AP-2 sites did not significantly affect IRAK2 promoter activity in naive and endotoxin-treated mononuclear cells, in dormant  and activated Jurkat T-cells, in lung and kidney cells.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. They are formed by the aggregation of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins under conditions of cellular stress. The context states that ""stress granules disassem","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist  longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular  change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state.","20674093, 24090136, 25437551, 21940797, 29035885",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"
Entresto is composed of which two drugs?,"Yes, Entresto is composed of valsartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) and sacubitril (a neprilysin inhibitor). The combination of these two drugs works to manage heart failure symptoms","Context: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common syndrome characterised by widespread pain and at  least 11/18 painful tender points that requires multimodal pharmacological  treatment also combined with non-pharmacological therapy. Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context: receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection  Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs. The drug works through  angiotensin receptor blockage via valsartan as well as neprilysin inhibition  with sacubitril. This represented a new milestone in managing heart failure  patients and provided yet another therapy in our armamentarium. This article  reviews the stages that led to the development of this drug, the failure of its  preceding agents, the lessons we have learnt, and the current trials of Entresto  for new indications., Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides.

Pregnancy was  identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to  H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our  knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H1N1 with  myocarditis in pregnancy.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29  and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory  manifestations of H1N1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester.

In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy  which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart.  In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In  addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the  frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The decrease in T3 serves as an indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to  increased mortality. In animal models, it can be shown that in pressure  overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy a decrease of thyroid hormone receptor levels occurs. Cardiac function can be improved by increasing expression of  thyroid hormone receptors mediated by adeno-associated virus based gene  transfer.

Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context:  The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+), Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats., Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases.","24205431, 22850463, 26342684, 24211676, 16964766",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"

Is Sotatercept effective for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension?,"Yes, sotatercept is effective for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The study showed that patients who received sotatercept had a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance compared to those who received a placebo. Additionally","Context: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by pulmonary  vascular remodeling, cellular proliferation, and poor long-term outcomes.  Dysfunctional bone morphogenetic protein pathway signaling is associated with  both hereditary and idiopathic subtypes. Sotatercept, a novel fusion protein,  binds activins and growth differentiation factors in the attempt to restore  balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signaling pathways.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"Yes, several mutations have been identified in relation to the Gray Platelet Syndrome (GPS). In the given context, four types of mutations are mentioned:  1. Biallelic mutations in the NBE","Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized  by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets. The  genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with  inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and α-granule deficiency. All  of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the α-granule content by  immunofluorescence analysis for α-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9  novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands.

We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome,, Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers  G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but  not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a  spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose that GATA1 is an upstream regulator of the genes required for platelet  alpha-granule biogenesis., Context:  Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a predominantly recessive platelet disorder that  is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia with large platelets and a paucity of  α-granules; these abnormalities cause mostly moderate but in rare cases severe bleeding.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are chemically reactive intermediates formed during the metabolism of certain drugs. They can bind to cellular proteins and form covalent adducts, which can lead to immune-mediated","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking.

Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation., Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies.

We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma., Context:  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a  genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation., Context: The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is  characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal  insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and  dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The, Context: change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported., Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of, Context: METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of presentation and outcomes for  42 children with achalasia presenting over three decades to a major pediatric  referral center. Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by  questionnaire.  RESULTS: We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The  median overall age at diagnosis was 10.8 years and median follow-up 1593 days.  Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65%), while  initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by  myotomy in 17 (85%). Ten out of 35 patients who underwent myotomy required a  repeat myotomy (29%). Patients with triple A syndrome developed symptoms earlier, but had delayed diagnosis, were more underweight at diagnosis and at  last follow up. Questionnaire results suggested a significant long term  deleterious impact on the quality of life of children and their families. CONCLUSION: Many children with achalasia relapse after initial treatment,  undergoing multiple, different procedures, despite which symptoms persist and  impact on quality of life. Symptoms develop earlier in patients with triple A","18551317, 18551317, 29255950, 20200814, 27411173","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes, according to the context, CEP-264","Context:  Rasburicase is a new treatment for hyperuricemia, a metabolic manifestation of  tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Rasburicase has a unique mechanism of action that  allows uric acid byproducts to be easily excreted in the urine. Clinical trials have shown that rasburicase has a rapid onset of action that allows chemotherapy  to be delivered on time and prevents hyperuricemia-related complications,  including renal compromise. The drug has been used successfully in adults and children. The main side effect of rasburicase is the potential for a  hypersensitivity reaction. The drug is contraindicated in patients with glucose  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency because this can precipitate, Context:  The number of global clinical trials including Japan is increasing but still  much lower than those including the USA and Europe. The regulatory requirements  for clinical trials have been harmonized among Japan, USA, and Europe, and the quality of clinical trials is kept high in these regions. Xofluza (baloxavir  marboxil) for influenza approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE Designation System  is a good example of clinical trials including Japan. To include Japan in more global clinical trials, stakeholders should work more collaboratively, and  increase the perception that clinical trials can be conducted appropriately and  efficiently in Japan.

Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose  CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement., Context: articles published on frailty syndrome in English, French and Spanish. Frailty  and aging are similar processes with some differences. Multiple  pathophysiological models of frailty have been studied. Factors associated with  frailty include hormonal adjustments, sarcopenia and vitamin deficiencies among  others. Biomarkers have been studied, but they are not specific. Phenotypes have  been developed, but early recognition and prevention of this syndrome are still  difficult. In conclusion, early recognition of this syndrome is of paramount  importance. Preventative strategies need to be studied. The role of specific  biomarkers in early detection of frailty needs to be defined.

Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE. Any part of the  heart can be affected, including the pericardium, myocardium, coronary arteries,  valves, and the conduction system. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, a high incidence of CAD has become increasingly recognized as a cause of  mortality, especially in older adult patients and those with long-standing SLE.  Many unanswered questions remain in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac manifestations of SLE. It is not currently possible to predict the  patients who are at greatest risk for the various types of cardiac involvement.  However, with the rapid advancement of basic science and translational research, Context: distended gallbladder with thickened wall, pericholecystic fluid and absence of  gallstones. Results Among the 8411 hospitalized SLE patients in PUMCH, 13  (0.15%) were identified to have SLE-AAC. Eleven (84.6%) of them were female,  with a mean age of 30.1 ± 8.6 years. AAC was the initial manifestation of SLE in  four (30.8%) cases. Eleven (84.6%) patients complained of fever and abdominal  pain, four (30.8%) had positive Murphy's sign and six (46.2%) had elevated liver  enzymes. The median SLE Disease Activity Index was 8.0 (range 0-20.0) at the  time of AAC. Other affected organs in SLE-AAC included kidney (11, 84.6%) and  hematologic system (11, 84.6%), followed by mucocutaneous (seven, 53.8%), musculoskeletal (seven, 53.8%) and neuropsychiatric (two, 15.4%) systems. All  patients received treatment of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants but none  underwent surgical intervention. During a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-320 months), 12 cases (92.4%) responded to treatment with no relapse and one  patient (7.6%) died of septic shock.
