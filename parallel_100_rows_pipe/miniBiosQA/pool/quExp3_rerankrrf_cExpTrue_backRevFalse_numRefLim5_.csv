What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation plays a significant role in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblast","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation, Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease","23179372, 19270706, 14688019, 14688019, 23184418","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene in mammalian cells encodes for DNA polymerase θ. This is explicitly stated in the first line of the context information provided.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by, Context: (one-third of the species analyzed) or multisegmental (the rest). Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution. The definition of  species-specific cGOFs provides powerful guidance for genome assembly and other  structure-based analysis, Context: INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: In this study we report on the different genetic  syndromes in which autism has been described as one of the possible  manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Certain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable  information about the role played by genetics in autism. This is the case of the  following syndromes: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 15q11-q13  duplication, fragile X syndrome, fragile X premutation, deletion of chromosome 2q, XYY syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Apert syndrome, mutations in the  ARX gene, De Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, Rett  syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Steinert disease, tuberous sclerosis, Duchenne's disease, Timothy  syndrome, 10p terminal deletion, Cowden syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, Myhre  syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Joubert syndrome,, Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic, Context: tyrosinase-related protein-1 gene (TYRP1) and OCA3 (MIM# 203290), the HPS gene  and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (MIM# 203300), the CHS gene (CHS1), and  Chediak-Higashi syndrome (MIM# 214500), and the X-linked ocular albinism gene  and OA1 (MIM#300500).

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68. This is explicitly stated in","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing.

Since NONCODE version 3.0 was released 2 years  ago, discovery of novel ncRNAs has been promoted by high-throughput RNA  sequencing (RNA-Seq). In this update of NONCODE, we expand the ncRNA data set by  collection of newly identified ncRNAs from literature published in the last 2  years and integration of the latest version of RefSeq and Ensembl. Particularly,  the number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increased sharply from 73 327 to  210 831. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of  lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs. The 56  018 and 46 475 lncRNA genes were generated from 95 135 and 67 628 lncRNAs for human and mouse, respectively. Additionally, we present expression profile of  lncRNA genes by graphs based on public RNA-seq data for human and mouse, as well  as predict functions of these lncRNA genes. The improvements brought to the database also include an incorporation of an ID conversion tool from RefSeq or  Ensembl ID to NONCODE ID and a service of lncRNA identification. NONCODE is also  accessible through http://www.noncode.org/, Context: understanding of cellular processes and gene regulation, along with implications  for the treatment of human disease. The recent ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA  Elements) study reported 9,640 lncRNA loci in the human genome, which  corresponds to around half the number of protein-coding genes. Because of this  sheer number and their functional diversity, it is crucial to identify a pool of  potentially relevant lncRNAs early on in a given study. In this review, we  evaluate the methods for isolating lncRNAs by immunoprecipitation and review the  advantages, disadvantages, and applications of three widely used approaches -  microarray, tiling array, and RNA-seq - for identifying lncRNAs involved in gene regulation. We also look at ways in which data from publicly available databases  such as ENCODE can support the study of lncRNAs, Context: Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases pose severe threats to human  health worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that at least 50% of foam cells  in atheromas are derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); the first  step in this process involves migration to human atherosclerotic lesions. Long  non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play significant roles in diverse  biological processes. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in VSMCs. The expression of lncRNAs or mRNAs was detected using reverse  transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Gene Expression  Omnibus datasets in the NCBI portal were searched using the key words 'Atherosclerosis AND tissue AND Homo sapiens' and the GSE12288 dataset.

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis refers to a condition characterized by the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers. It can either be isolated or occur in association with systemic conditions.","Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context:  PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated  ectopia lentis (EL) family. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were collected from the  family including sixteen patients with isolated EL. Blood samples of nine patients, one normal person and two unknown children's were collected. Genomic  DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood. Genotyping was performed  by microsatellite markers and logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE Programs.

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. The","Context: mRNA is subsequently degraded. In eukaryotes, Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) and Hbs1  are responsible for solving general problems of ribosomal stall in translation.  In archaea, aPelota and aEF1α, homologous to Pelota and Hbs1, respectively, are  considered to be involved in that process. In recent years, great progress has  been made in determining structures of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1α. In this  review, we focus on the functional roles of Dom34/aPelota and Hbs1/aEF1α in  ribosome rescue, based on recent structural studies of them.

The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are indeed involved in gene silencing. They guide Piwi proteins to silence transposable elements (TEs) at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, piRNA-","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform. These results suggest TE sequences are the most direct of PIWI, Context: absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell  proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating  RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing, Context: Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were reported in 2006 as a novel class of small  non-coding RNAs associated with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute/Piwi family.  Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles  in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in  epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In addition,  the function of this pathway in somatic cells has also been more systematically  characterized. The new findings reveal the Piwi-piRNA pathway as a more general  mechanism of gene regulation, Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide explicit details on what the minimal genome build is. The text discusses the concept of a minimal genome, its importance in synthetic biology, and the challenges in defining it, but it does not provide a","Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced, Context: As a key focus of synthetic biology, building a minimal artificial cell has  given rise to many discussions. A synthetic minimal cell will provide an  appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems  with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and  construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a  cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome.  Kinds of approaches, based on bioinformatics and molecular biology, have been  developed and proceeded to derive essential genes and minimal gene sets for the  synthetic minimal genome. Experiments about streamlining genomes of model bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created, Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell, Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) and methylates Lys-142 of DNMT1. In addition, it has been shown to","Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation  patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the  activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). Here, we show that  SET7, a known histone methyltransferase, is involved in the regulation of  protein stability of DNMT1. SET7 colocalizes and directly interacts with DNMT1  and specifically monomethylates Lys-142 of DNMT1. Methylated DNMT1 peaks during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle and is prone to proteasome-mediated  degradation. Overexpression of SET7 leads to decreased DNMT1 levels, and  siRNA-mediated knockdown of SET7 stabilizes DNMT1. These results demonstrate that signaling through SET7 represents a means of DNMT1 enzyme turnover, Context:  A novel histone methyltransferase, termed Set9, was isolated from human cells.  Set9 contains a SET domain, but lacks the pre- and post-SET domains. Set9  methylates specifically lysine 4 (K4) of histone H3 (H3-K4) and potentiates transcription activation. The histone H3 tail interacts specifically with the  histone deacetylase NuRD complex. Methylation of histone H3-K4 by Set9 precludes  the association of NuRD with the H3 tail. Moreover, methylation of H3-K4 impairs Suv39h1-mediated methylation at K9 of H3 (H3-K9). The interplay between the Set9  and Suv39h1 histone methyltransferases is specific, as the methylation of H3-K9  by the histone methyltransferase G9a was not affected by Set9 methylation of, Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the  hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a, Context:  Methylation of histone tails plays a pivotal role in the regulation of a wide  range of biological processes. SET and MYND domain-containing protein (SMYD) is  a methyltransferase, five family members of which have been identified in humans.

However, the  physiological functions of SMYD5 remain unknown. To investigate the function of Smyd5 in vivo, zebrafish were utilised as a model system.

Of 10,038 original  participants, 3022 subjects underwent Sasang Constitutional Type (SCT)  evaluation. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to predict CVD during the  ten year follow-up period.  RESULTS: Of 3022 participants, SCT classified into 364 (12%) SE, 1053 (34.8%)  SY, 1605 (53.1%) TE, and no TY.

The CVD events were significantly different among the types when MetS was present.

In this monograph we review data on the  pharmacokinetics, metabolism and safety of fremanezumab as reported in the  scientific literature from phase I to phase III studies. Fremanezumab  demonstrated a very low incidence of adverse events. Primary and secondary endpoints in randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy of fremanezumab were  achieved. Fremanezumab was demonstrated to be able to reduce the number of  migraine days, headache hours and number of days with use of acute treatment agents.

However, it is worth mentioning that fremanezumab showed a very low incidence of  development of adverse drug antibodies compared with other CGRP antibodies, Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes.

RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes.

Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?,"Yes, a de novo mutation in FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) gene, specifically a Gly380Arg mutation in the transmembrane domain of the protein, is","Context: increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals,  suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals  are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal  dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In  contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and  affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia  parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome  4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains  a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes.

RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese.

Besides the specific  features of achondroplasia, synostosis of the metopic, coronal, lambdoid, and  squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried  out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common  achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as  molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any  additional genetic alteration. It is suggested that this unusual phenotype is a result of variable expressivity of the common achondroplasia mutation, Context: Achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism in humans, occurs  between 1 in 15,000 and 40,000 live births. More than 90% of cases are sporadic  and there is, on average, an increased paternal age at the time of conception of  affected individuals.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"Yes, HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels by affecting regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These","Context:  Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics. Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that, Context: intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that  several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding,  affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels. These data  provide a functional explanation for the genetic association of HBS1L-MYB  intergenic polymorphisms with human erythroid traits and HbF levels. Our results  further designate MYB as a target for therapeutic induction of HbF to ameliorate  sickle cell and β-thalassemia disease severity, Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is  marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin, Context:  Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) modulates the phenotype of sickle cell anemia by  inhibiting deoxy sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization. The blood concentration  of HbF, or the number of cells with detectable HbF (F-cells), does not measure the amount of HbF/F-cell. Even patients with high HbF can have severe disease  because HbF is unevenly distributed among F-cells, and some cells might have  insufficient concentrations to inhibit HbS polymerization. With mean HbF levels of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the distribution of HbF/F-cell can greatly vary, even  if the mean is constant. For example, with 20% HbF, as few as 1% and as many as  24% of cells can have polymer-inhibiting, or protective, levels of HbF of ∼10, Context: described. Moreover, several pathological and nonpathological conditions  affecting the beta-globin gene cluster, such as beta-thalassemia, sickle cell  disease, deltabeta-thalassemia, and hereditary persistence of HbF syndromes, are  characterized by the continued synthesis of gamma-globin chains in the adult  life.

Does TIMELESS-TIPIN participate in replisome disassembly?,"Yes, TIMELESS-TIPIN plays a role in replisome disassembly. In the absence of TIMELESS-TIPIN, the UBXN-3 adaptor protein is important for replisome disassembly.","Context: p97/CDC-48 ""unfoldase"". Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution with in vivo  studies in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, to show that the replisome-associated  TIMELESS-TIPIN complex is required for CUL-2LRR-1 recruitment and efficient CMG  helicase ubiquitylation. Aided by TIMELESS-TIPIN, CUL-2LRR-1 directs a suite of  ubiquitylation enzymes to ubiquitylate the MCM-7 subunit of CMG. Subsequently,  the UBXN-3 adaptor protein directly stimulates the disassembly of ubiquitylated  CMG by CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4. We show that UBXN-3 is important in vivo for  replisome disassembly in the absence of TIMELESS-TIPIN. Correspondingly,  co-depletion of UBXN-3 and TIMELESS causes profound synthetic lethality. Since the human orthologue of UBXN-3, FAF1, is a candidate tumour suppressor, these  findings suggest that manipulation of CMG disassembly might be applicable to  future strategies for treating human cancer, Context:  Blocks in replication result from impediments to the advancing replication  machinery and are lethal if not resolved. The replication fork must be  reassembled for DNA synthesis to proceed. Fork assembly outside the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) is mediated by recombination or via a  helicase-dependent pathway. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites  initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. We review evidence suggesting that R-loops are frequent during normal cell growth  and that R-loops are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. We  propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by, Context: synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a  significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a  proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are  synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Third, the principal  mechanism of Okazaki fragment processing is via generation of flaps, which have  the potential to form a variety of structures in their sequence context.  Finally, many proteins for the lagging strand interact with factors involved in  repair and recombination. Thus, lagging strand DNA synthesis could be the best  example of a converging place of both replication and repair proteins. To achieve the risky task with extraordinary fidelity, Okazaki fragment processing  may depend on multiple layers of redundant, but connected pathways. An essential  Dna2 endonuclease/helicase plays a pivotal role in processing common structural intermediates that occur during diverse DNA metabolisms (e.g. lagging strand  synthesis and telomere maintenance). Many roles of Dna2 suggest that the  preemptive removal of long or structured flaps ultimately contributes to genome, Context: locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by  RNA polymerase II. In addition, converged replication forks accumulated at all  of these sites in the absence of Pfh1. The effects of Pfh1 on DNA replication  are likely direct, as it had high binding to sites whose replication was  impaired in its absence. Replication in the absence of Pfh1 resulted in DNA  damage specifically at those sites that bound high levels of Pfh1 in wild-type  cells and whose replication was slowed in its absence. Cells depleted of Pfh1  were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome  component that stabilizes stalled forks. Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at  hard-to-replicate sites, Context: Protecting replication fork integrity during DNA replication is essential for  maintaining genome stability. Here, we report that SDE2, a PCNA-associated  protein, plays a key role in maintaining active replication and counteracting  replication stress by regulating the replication fork protection complex (FPC).  SDE2 directly interacts with the FPC component TIMELESS (TIM) and enhances its  stability, thereby aiding TIM localization to replication forks and the coordination of replisome progression. Like TIM deficiency, knockdown of SDE2  leads to impaired fork progression and stalled fork recovery, along with a  failure to activate CHK1 phosphorylation. Moreover, loss of SDE2 or TIM results in an excessive MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks. Together, our  study uncovers an essential role for SDE2 in maintaining genomic integrity by  stabilizing the FPC and describes a new role for TIM in protecting stalled","34269473, 15569610, 20131965, 22426534, 33127907",Yes.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"Yes, avelumab is effective for bladder cancer. The context states that avelumab has shown promising antitumor activity in patients with urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) and has received","Context: (40 [16%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21  (8%) of 249 patients, the most common of which were fatigue (four [2%]), and  asthenia, elevated lipase, hypophosphataemia, and pneumonitis in two (1%)  patients each. 19 (8%) of 249 patients had a serious adverse event related to  treatment with avelumab, and one treatment-related death occurred (pneumonitis). INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients  with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety  profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients. These data provide the  rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis. FUNDING: Merck KGaA, and Pfizer Inc, Context: unchanged for the last 20-30 years. Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and  its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown  promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and  PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could  potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical  efficacy, Context: by independent review. Safety analysis was done in all patients who received at  least one dose of avelumab. Antitumour activity was assessed in post-platinum  patients who received at least one dose of avelumab. This trial is registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort of  patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma is closed and the trial is  ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2014, and March 15, 2016, 329 patients with advanced  metastatic urothelial carcinoma were screened for enrolment into this study; 249  patients were eligible and received treatment with avelumab for a median of 12  weeks (IQR 6·0-19·7) and followed up for a median of 9·9 months (4·3-12·1). Safety and antitumour activity were evaluated at data cutoff on June 9, 2016. In  161 post-platinum patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, a best overall  response of complete or partial response was recorded in 27 patients (17%; 95% CI 11-24), including nine (6%) complete responses and 18 (11%) partial  responses. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (any grade in ≥10%  patients) were infusion-related reaction (73 [29%]; all grade 1-2) and fatigue, Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma.

What is the purpose of the Tokuhashi scoring system?,"Yes, the Tokuhashi scoring system is used to predict the prognosis of patients with spinal metastases. It can accurately predict early death, which can help avoid major operations for these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score","Context: calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score  and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38,  respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system  overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system  underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS: Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict  prognosis of spinal metastases after operation.

The median survival time of 146  patients with low grade primary tumor of thyroid, breast and prostate was 12  months. The median survival time of 146 patients with medium grade primary tumor  of kidney, lymphoma, ovary and uterus, and unknown primary tumor was 7. 1  months. The median survival time of 211 patients with the Tokuhashi revised  score of 0 to 8 points was 4 months. The median survival time of 147 patients  with the Tokuhashi revised score of 9 to 11 points was 10 months. The median  survival time of 89 patients with the Tokuhashi revised score of 12 to 15 points was 29 months. The differences between the groups were significant (P<0. 01 or  0. 0001). The Tokuhashi revised score was positively correlated with survival  time (r=0. 833, P<0. 001).

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,"Yes, HER-2 belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of proteins. This is stated explicitly in the first sentence of the second context passage.","Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases. Likewise, the highest concentrations of this oncoprotein are found in patients with breast cancer, but lower concentrations  may be found in other malignancies, particularly ovarian, prostate and lung  cancer (mainly adenocarcinomas).

In three of nine matched pairs, the  AD prostate biopsy was HER-2 negative, and the AI metastatic sample was HER-2  positive. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab is not effective as a single agent for the treatment of  patients with AI HER-2 negative tumors. HER-2 expression varies by clinical state in patients with prostate carcinoma: Accurate HER-2 profiling requires  sampling metastatic tissue in patients with metastatic disease. Further  development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of  sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2  positive tumors, Context:  HER-2 belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family.

Abnormal neurogenesis and neurotransmission have been implicated in the  pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.

In treatment AB, 50 mg  empagliflozin was administered once daily (q.d.) for 5 days (treatment A),  immediately followed by coadministration of 50 mg empagliflozin q.d. and 100 mg  sitagliptin q.d. over 5 days (treatment B). In treatment C, 100 mg sitagliptin was administered q.d. for 5 days. A washout period of ≥7 days separated  treatments AB and C.

BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin, traditionally known as a hematopoietic hormone, has  been linked to neovascularization. Whereas administration of EPO acutely after  MI reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function, its role in the failing  heart is unknown. METHODS: Rats underwent coronary ligation or sham surgery. Rats with MI were  randomly assigned to: untreated (MI), a single bolus of EPO immediately after MI  induction (MI-EPO-early), EPO treatment immediately after MI and once every  three weeks (MI-EPO-early+late), and EPO treatment starting three weeks after induction of MI, once every three weeks (MI-EPO-late). After nine weeks,  hemodynamics, infarct size, myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, myocyte  hypertrophy, and capillary density were measured. RESULTS: Erythropoietin treatment started immediately after MI (MI-EPO-early and  MI-EPO-early+late) resulted in a 23% to 30% reduction in infarct size (p < 0.01)  and, accordingly, hemodynamic improvement.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. This is evident in a study where recombinant Bax was used to induce apoptosis in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. The results showed","Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors, Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis, Context: Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an apoptosis-inducing protein that  participates in cell death during normal development and in various diseases.  Bax resides in an inactive state in the cytosol of many cells. In response to  death stimuli, Bax protein undergoes conformational changes that expose  membrane-targeting domains, resulting in its translocation to mitochondrial  membranes, where Bax inserts and causes release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin  (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes. HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Conversely,  reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and  increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association","23536162, 23475110, 23567243, 21069436, 12732850","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

This was determined by finding a significant","Context: METHODS: All participants underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, and the stage of  endometriosis was determined according to the Revised American Fertility Society  classification. Of the 138 women enrolled, 59 had no endometriosis, 21 had stage  I, 10 had stage II, 23 had stage III and 25 had stage IV. SNPs were  discriminated by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. RESULTS: Individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of  HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype:  adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI  1.08-8.43). There was a significant trend associating A/G + A/A genotypes with severity of endometriosis (P for trend < 0.01). No statistically significant  association was found for the CYP19 polymorphism.

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in  HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of  HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis, Context: NK and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and its genetic polymorphisms were tested in  endometriosis. We found that median Granzyme B levels were significantly  different in patients with the GG genotype in the control group, compared to  those with the AA and AG genotype. However, this difference was not detected  between the control and endometriosis groups.What are the implications of these  findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our results contribute  to uncovering the pathogenesis of endometriosis since there are no previous  studies in the literature regarding this topic. Although we did not find a  difference, our results will inform further studies made on this topic. Studies with different molecules and an increased number of patients are needed. The  immune defect of endometriosis may not be due exclusively to Granzyme B. Other  mediators that are secreted from immune cells may have mutual effects and  interactions, Context: Leprechaunism is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by  severe insulin resistance. This disease is caused by a defective insulin  receptor and features abnormal glucose metabolism and retarded intrauterine and  postnatal growth. However, there are few reports on the long-term course of  leprechaunism. We reported the long-term clinical course and rh-IGF-1 treatment  in a patient with leprechaunism. During follow-up her diabetes gradually  deteriorated despite of treatment of rh-IGF-1. Furthermore, she developed  endometrioid adenocarcinoma at the age of 24 yr. The development of endometrial  disease must be carefully followed up in this disease, Context: data has revealed strong candidates for the causal SNPs within these critical  regions; however, the molecular pathogenesis of these SNPs is currently unknown.  We used gene expression data collected from whole blood from 862 individuals and  endometrial tissue from 136 individuals from independent populations of European  descent to examine the mechanism underlying endometriosis susceptibility.  Association mapping results from 7,090 individuals (2,594 cases and 4,496  controls) supported rs3820282 as the SNP with the strongest association for  endometriosis risk (P = 1.84 × 10−5, OR = 1.244 (1.126-1.375)). SNP rs3820282 is  a significant eQTL in whole blood decreasing expression of LINC00339 (also known as HSPC157) and increasing expression of CDC42 (P = 2.0 ×10−54 and 4.5x10−4  respectively).

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in various types of cancer including lung, bladder, prostate, and liver cancers. This upregulation has been associated with poor patient prognosis and tumor progression. The","Context: increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth,  movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1, Context: small interfering RNA or negative control small interfering RNA. The cell  proliferation changes of the transfected bladder urothelial carcinoma cells were  determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis caused by silencing MALAT1 was  evaluated using the flow cytometry assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The motility changes induced by silencing MALAT1 were measured using the wound  healing assay. RESULTS: MALAT1 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma compared with  matched normal urothelium (P=.008). The MALAT1 expression levels were greater in  high-grade carcinomas than in low-grade carcinoma (P=.001). The MALAT1  expression levels were greater in invasive carcinoma than in noninvasive carcinoma (P=.018). Cell proliferation inhibition, increased apoptosis, and  decreased motility were observed in MALAT1 small interfering RNA-transfected  bladder urothelial carcinoma T24 and 5637 cells. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 plays an oncogenic role in urothelial carcinoma of the  bladder. Silencing MALAT1 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for this  cancer, Context: PURPOSE: To understand the role of MALAT-1 in prostate cancer we evaluated its  expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. We also studied the  therapeutic effects of MALAT-1 silencing on castration resistant prostate cancer  cells in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction was used to detect MALAT-1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. siRNA against MALAT-1 was designed and the silencing effect was  examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The  biological effects of MALAT-1 siRNA on cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation using a cell counting kit and cell colony assays as well as cell  migration by in vitro scratch assay, cell invasion by Transwell® invasion assay  and cell cycle by flow cytometry. We further investigated the effect of, Context: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a long  non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and associated  with cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the, Context: same viral oncogenes in addition to increasing MALAT-1 transcription have also  been shown to inhibit p53 and/or pRb function. In p53 mutant or inactive cell  lines MALAT-1 was also shown to be highly upregulated. We hypothesize that there  is a correlation between MALAT-1 over-expression and p53 deregulation. In  conclusion, we show that disruption of p53, by both polyoma and papilloma  oncoproteins appear to play an important role in the up-regulation of MALAT-1.  MALAT-1 might therefore represent a biomarker for p53 deregulation within  malignancies","22088988, 23153939, 23845456, 21678027, 24163781",Malat-1 expression is upregulated in several tumor types,"21266177, 16878148, 24163781, 22722759, 21678027, 16441420, 18006640, 23845456, 20007090, 22858678, 23726266, 15552795, 22088988, 12970751"

Yet, the factors involved and  the mechanisms by which the 3D organization of the nucleus is established remain  poorly understood. The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based  approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural  proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins  orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of  interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their  co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D  chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene  expression, Context: Since Jacob and Monod's characterization of the role of DNA elements in gene  control, it has been recognized that the linear organization of genome structure  is important for the regulation of gene transcription and hence the  manifestation of phenotypes. Similarly, it has long been hypothesized that the  spatial organization (in three dimensions evolving through time), as part of the  epigenome, makes a significant contribution to the genotype-phenotype transition. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation  capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC and ChIA-Pet) are  increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype.  The apparent simplicity of these methodologies-crosslink chromatin, digest,  dilute, ligate, detect interactions-belies the complexity of the data and the, Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology.

Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Although different expression patterns of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1  and beta1 have been reported, no essential distinction has been established in  their functions. Unlike the TR beta gene, a mutation in the TR alpha1 gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).  Previously we found a mutant TR beta with an 11-carboxyl (C)-terminal amino acid  truncation (betaF451X) in a girl with severe RTH. BetaF451X is a natural mutant with disruption of the transactivation domain, tau4, and it had very strong  dominant negative activities.

At week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the  brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups were 51% and 64%, respectively, as compared  with 44% among patients who switched from placebo to open-label brodalumab;  responses were sustained through week 52. At week 12, serious adverse events had  occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the  placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab significantly improved response rates among patients with psoriatic arthritis. Larger studies of longer duration are necessary to  assess adverse events. (Funded by Amgen; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01516957  .), Context: The primary end point was the percentage improvement from baseline in the PASI  score at week 12. Secondary end points included improvement of at least 75% and  at least 90% in the PASI score and the score on the static physician's global  assessment at week 12. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients underwent randomization. At week 12, the mean  percentage improvements in the PASI score were 45.0% among patients receiving 70  mg of brodalumab, 85.9% among those receiving 140 mg, 86.3% among those  receiving 210 mg, 76.0% among those receiving 280 mg, and 16.0% among those  receiving placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). An improvement of at least 75% and at least 90% in the PASI score at week 12 was seen in 77% and  72%, respectively, of the patients in the 140-mg brodalumab group and in 82% and  75%, respectively, of the patients in the 210-mg group, as compared with 0% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The percentage of patients with  a static physician's global assessment of clear or minimal disease was 26%, 85%,  80%, and 69% with the 70-mg, 140-mg, 210-mg, and 280-mg doses, respectively, of, Context: the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The percentage of patients with  a static physician's global assessment of clear or minimal disease was 26%, 85%,  80%, and 69% with the 70-mg, 140-mg, 210-mg, and 280-mg doses, respectively, of  brodalumab, as compared with 3% with placebo (P<0.01 for all comparisons with  placebo). Two cases of grade 3 neutropenia were reported in the 210-mg  brodalumab group. The most commonly reported adverse events in the combined  brodalumab groups were nasopharyngitis (8%), upper respiratory tract infection  (8%), and injection-site erythema (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab significantly improved plaque psoriasis in this 12-week, phase 2 study. (Funded by Amgen; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975637.), Context: Advances in knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of psoriasis have allowed the  development of a new class of agents known as biologic drugs. Data confirm that  T helper (Th)17 and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling has a crucial role in the  pathogenesis of the disease. High levels of IL-17 and Th17-related cytokines  have been reported in psoriasis, leading to the suggestion of agents targeting  IL-17 as a potential therapeutic strategy in psoriasis. Brodalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17 receptor A, blocking the effects of  IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17E. Data from Phase I and Phase II clinical trials  indicate that brodalumab has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with strong clinical activity, suggesting that it is a potential tool for use in the  treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, Context: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can lead to significant illness or even  death without proper intervention and treatment. With vast implications through  a novel mechanism, belimumab offers a new standard of treatment for physicians  in the complications associated with SLE, specifically lupus nephritis. By  targeting B cell signaling and maturation, belimumab is able to mitigate the  underlying pathological complications surrounding SLE. Phase 3 clinical trials  with belimumab have depicted clinically efficacious applications, suggesting  belimumab as a revolutionary breakthrough in the treatment armamentarium for  practicing clinicians. This article explains the precise mechanism of action of belimumab on the soluble protein BlyS that plays a major role in the  pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.

What do studies show about the effect of Induced hypothermia in premature babies?,"Yes, studies suggest that induced hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC (Necrotizing Enterocolitis) is both feasible and safe. However, further investigation is needed to establish the","Context: Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with  hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or  neurodevelopmental disabilities. Little is known about applications of this  treatment to preterm newborns. Studies in animal experimental models  demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia in preterm fetuses but clinical  application to newborn infants are limited to restricted cases, as severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We present a case of therapeutic whole body  cooling in a baby at 34 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with HIE, Context: OBJECTIVE: To review and revise the 1987 pediatric brain death guidelines. METHODS: Relevant literature was reviewed. Recommendations were developed using  the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation)  system.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Determination of brain death in term  newborns, infants, and children is a clinical diagnosis based on the absence of  neurologic function with a known irreversible cause of coma. Because of  insufficient data in the literature, recommendations for preterm infants <37  weeks gestational age are not included in these guidelines. (2) Hypotension,  hypothermia, and metabolic disturbances should be treated and corrected, and medications that can interfere with the neurologic examination and apnea testing  should be discontinued allowing for adequate clearance before proceeding with  these evaluations. (3) Two examinations including apnea testing with each examination separated by an observation period are required. Examinations should  be performed by different attending physicians. Apnea testing may be performed  by the same physician. An observation period of 24 hours for term newborns (37, Context: Statistically significant relationships were identified between core temperature  and heart rate (P < .0001), pH (P < .0001), base excess (P = .003), and blood  clot dynamics (longer time to initial clot formation, slower rate of clot  formation, and decrease in clot strength; all P < .001) as assessed by  thromboelastography. No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted  during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no  increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who  were cooled. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC  seems both feasible and safe. Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted, Context: OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with multiple organ dysfunction  syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality. There is extensive  experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in  infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety  of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a  randomized trial.  METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants  who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at  least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress. Three groups (n = 5 per group) were  cooled to core temperatures of 35.5 degrees C (+/-0.5 degrees C), 34.5 degrees  C, and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, for 48 hours before rewarming to 37 degrees C. Infants were carefully assessed to identify adverse effects that potentially  were related to cooling and rewarming. A noncooled group (n = 10) with advanced  surgical NEC and MODS was used for comparison. Data are medians (interquartile  range), Context: INTRODUCTION: Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia  for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term or  late preterm infants. In August 2006, the Neonatology Department at  Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, introduced total body cooling for infants born at  term with HIE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprises data from medical  records of newborn children born with HIE during a period of 32 months. Relevant  data for cooling were recorded. Structured neurological examinations were  carried out on survivors when they were ten and or 18 months old. RESULTS: A total of 32 infants fulfilled the criteria for cooling, the incidence being 0.4/1000 births. Twenty infants were cooled for 72 hours. Eleven infants  had cooling discontinued before 72 hours because of their grave prognosis. One  infant had cooling discontinued because of pulmonary hypertension. Most infants were cooled before six hours of age (median four hours). The mortality rate was  41%. A total of 45% were cooled without being placed in a ventilator. The side  effects were of no major concern. Eight children had a neurological follow-up","22320395, 22522447, 20100756, 20100756, 20470651",Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in term or late preterm infants.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat is telomerase. It binds with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhib","Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context: diastereomers in animals or humans. The key aims of the experiment were to  examine darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide with respect to (a)  assessment of in vitro metabolic stability and protein binding and (b)  characterization of in vivo oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics in mice. METHODS: In vitro (liver microsomes stability and protein binding) and in vivo  experiments (oral/intravenous dosing to mice) were carried out using  darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,Rdarolutamide. Besides, tissue levels of  darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide were measured following oral  and intravenous dosing. Appropriate plasma/tissue samples served to determine the pharmacokinetics of various analytes in mice. Liquid chromatography in  tandem with mass spectrometry procedures enabled the delineation of the plasma  pharmacokinetics, in vitro and tissue uptake data of the various analytes. RESULTS: Chiral inversion was absent in the metabolic stability study. However,  darolutamide showed profound stereoselectivity (S,S-darolutamide greater than  S,R-darolutamide) after either intravenous or oral dosing. S,R-darolutamide but, Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose  of this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2  inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms ""SGLT2"" and ""SGLT2  inhibitor"" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes. They are generally well tolerated. However, due, Context: BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified  with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity. It  has been shown to inhibit megakaryocytic proliferation in vitro in cells  obtained from patients with essential thrombocythemia. In this phase 2 study, we  investigated whether imetelstat could elicit hematologic and molecular responses  in patients with essential thrombocythemia who had not had a response to or who  had had unacceptable side effects from prior therapies. METHODS: A total of 18 patients in two sequential cohorts received an initial  dose of 7.5 or 9.4 mg of imetelstat per kilogram of body weight intravenously once a week until attainment of a platelet count of approximately 250,000 to  300,000 per cubic millimeter. The primary end point was the best hematologic  response. RESULTS: Imetelstat induced hematologic responses in all 18 patients, and 16 patients (89%) had a complete hematologic response.

The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress. These results demonstrate the  presence of important mechanisms for defense against Fol in the tomato genotype  BHRS 2,3, Context: in three separate animals. Of these DEGs, 52 were overlapping DEGs. Using these  data, we determined the enriched GO terms, metabolic pathways and candidate  genes associated with meat color traits. Additionally, we mapped 114  non-redundant DEGs to the meat color QTLs via a comparative analysis with the  porcine quantitative trait loci (QTL) database. Overall, our data serve as a  valuable resource for identifying genes whose functions are critical for meat  color traits and can accelerate studies of the molecular mechanisms of meat  color formation, Context: neighbors within a few hours. The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues. On the  basis of these staining patterns, we found that many olfactory sensory neurons  in the developing mouse olfactory epithelium showed sustained caspase activity","17077494, 17077494, 28549197, 27748458, 18483489",Ranasmurfin is a blue protein.,"20615601, 17077494"
List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome. The two most common symptoms are idiopathic intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities.","Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome, Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly type III) is a craniosynostosis  syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although similar to the  other craniosynostosis syndromes in its clinical presentation, this syndrome is  caused by a mutation in the TWIST1 gene. The TWIST1 gene product is a  transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain important  in the development of the head and limbs. Clinical features of this syndrome include unilateral or bilateral coronal synostosis, ptosis, low-set ears,  hearing loss, hypertelorism, maxillary hypoplasia, deviated nasal septum, broad  great toes, clinodactyly, and syndactyly. We report a young girl with clinical features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome who has a previously undescribed sequence  variant in the TWIST1 gene, corresponding to p.R191M. The location of the  altered amino acid in the Twist-box of TWIST1, the high conservation of this, Context: Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant  adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological  abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis, Context: tumors. We report, a 14-year-old boy who presented with clinical features of  aplastic anemia (AA).

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 does have an effect on chromatin. It is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression through histone modification. Specifically, it adds methyl","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context: Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a potentially fatal bone marrow (BM) failure  syndrome. IFN-γ-producing Th1 CD4(+) T cells mediate the immune destruction of  hematopoietic cells, and they are central to the pathogenesis. However, the  molecular events that control the development of BM-destructive Th1 cells remain  largely unknown. Ezh2 is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that regulates multiple  cellular processes primarily by silencing gene expression. We recently reported that Ezh2 is crucial for inflammatory T cell responses after allogeneic BM  transplantation. To elucidate whether Ezh2 mediates pathogenic Th1 responses in  AA and the mechanism of Ezh2 action in regulating Th1 cells, we studied the effects of Ezh2 inhibition in CD4(+) T cells using a mouse model of human AA.  Conditionally deleting Ezh2 in mature T cells dramatically reduced the  production of BM-destructive Th1 cells in vivo, decreased BM-infiltrating Th1, Context: In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia  (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (Ezh2). Tumor cells show little residual H3K27 trimethylation marks compared  with controls. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 Polycomb group protein complex,  which is associated with DNA methyltransferases. Using next-generation  sequencing, we identify alteration in gene expression levels of EZH2 and acquired mutations in PRC2-associated genes (DNMT3A and JARID2) in human adult  T-ALL. Together, these studies document that deregulation of EZH2 and associated  genes leads to the development of mouse, and likely human, T-ALL, Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy, Context: The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer  of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Several lines of  evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and  perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed,  the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and  with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene. The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a  candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype. We  report here the genomic structure and fine mapping of the EZH2 gene.

This means that only one copy of the altered gene, inherited from either parent, is sufficient to cause the disorder.","Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy). DNA analysis was based on EcoRI/BlnI restriction enzyme digestion  followed by hybridization with P13E-11 molecular probe. In our material, we have, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent adult  muscular dystrophies. The common clinical signs usually appear during the second  decade of life but when the first molecular dysregulations occur is still unknown. Our aim was to determine whether molecular dysregulations can be  identified during FSHD fetal muscle development. We compared muscle biopsies  derived from FSHD1 fetuses and the cells derived from some of these biopsies with biopsies and cells derived from control fetuses. We mainly focus on DUX4  isoform expression because the expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both  FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. We measured DUX4 isoform, Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common autosomal dominant  muscular dystrophy caused by truncation of D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35.  Facial and shoulder-girdle muscles are preferentially affected but clinical symptoms are quite variable even within the same family. Asymmetrical muscle  involvement is also characteristic in this disease. There are no disease  specific changes on muscle pathology, and genetic diagnosis is performed by the southern blotting analysis. Recent advances provide us several ideas on possible  pathomechanisms of this complicated disease. There are several genes on  chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study mentioned in the context, there is evidence that consuming tomato juice can lower cholesterol levels. The study found that total and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly reduced after participants consumed a high","Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

When was vaxchora first licensed by the FDA?,"Yes, Vaxchora was first licensed by the FDA on June 10, 2016. This is stated explicitly in the context.","Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to  these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections, Context: efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally  downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus,  demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for  economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need, Context: EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c,  FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body  weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop  diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60  ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side  effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin  offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable  side-effect profile. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency, Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents.

It has limited effects on myocardial contractility; is available in a  powder-filled capsule and has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours.  METHODS: Pharmacy records were reviewed to identify pediatric patients who had  received isradipine. The following demographic data were obtained: age, weight,  sex, underlying medical problems, and initial blood pressure values. Information  concerning isradipine included the initial dose and its interval, subsequent  dose escalations, blood pressure response to the medication, and duration of  therapy. RESULTS: The study population comprised 12 patients, ranging in age from 10 days to 11 years. The etiology of the hypertension was renal in 9 cases and nonrenal  in 3. Initial dosing with isradipine was 0.1 mg/kg/dose. Six patients had  emergent hypertension, and their blood pressure had been controlled with intravenous nicardipine before oral isradipine.

Four trials evaluated the safety and  efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as  an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner, Context: INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their  lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission.

Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the  pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations, Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro, Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development, Context:  To better understand the genetic basis of medulloblastoma development, we sought  genomic amplifications and deletions in these tumors using digital karyotyping  in combination with expression analysis. Five medulloblastoma genomes were karyotyped by sequencing an average of 195,745 genomic DNA tags for each  analysis. Tags were tallied at unique positions and mapped to the human genome  to determine DNA copy numbers in high resolution along each chromosome.

LB100 suppressed phosphorylation of the  STAT3 protein and several STAT3 downstream targets. Also, LB100 directly  increased cisplatin uptake and overcame cisplatin-resistance in vitro. Finally,  LB100 exhibited potent in vivo anti-neoplastic activity in combination with cisplatin in an intracranial xenograft model, Context: Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas (AAM) represent 20% of all meningiomas. They  are associated with poor outcomes due to their tendency to recur. While surgery  and radiation (RT) are first line therapy, no effective systemic medical  treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro.

The antitumor effects of combining LB-100  with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse  model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the  radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic  assays. LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by γ-H2AX),  mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated  meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of  its downstream proteins. In vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the survival of mice with xenografts compared to RT alone. Taken together, these  results provide convincing preclinical data to support the use of LB-100 as a  radiosensitizing agent for treatment of malignant meningioma. Its potential for clinical application deserves further investigation, Context:  Purpose: To determine the MTD and to assess the safety, tolerability, and  potential activity of LB-100, a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor of  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in adult patients with progressive solid tumors.Experimental Design: LB-100 was administered intravenously daily for 3  days in 21-day cycles in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design.Results: There were 29  patient entries over 7 dose escalations.

What is ceritinib?,"Ceritinib is a highly selective inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is an important cancer target. It is an investigational compound, and a liquid chromatography tandem mass spect","Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase, Context: Ceritinib is a highly selective inhibitor of an important cancer target,  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Because it is an investigational compound,  there is a need to develop a robust and reliable analytical method for its  quantitative determination in human plasma. Here, we report the validation of a  liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid  quantification of ceritinib in human plasma. The method consists of protein precipitation with acetonitrile, and salting-out assisted liquid-liquid  extraction (SALLE) using a saturated solution of sodium chloride prior to  analysis by LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) technique in positive mode. Samples were eluted at 0.800 mL min(-1) on Ascentis Express® C18 column  (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) with a mobile phase made of 0.1 % formic acid in water  (A) and 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The method run time was 3.6 min, Context: On September 15, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved  subcutaneous fremanezumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal  antibody, for the treatment of episodic and chronic migraine in adults, with two  recommended dosages: 225 mg monthly or 675 mg every 3 months. On March 28, 2019,  the European Commission granted fremanezumab Marketing Authorization in the E.U.  for the same indication. In this monograph we review data on the  pharmacokinetics, metabolism and safety of fremanezumab as reported in the  scientific literature from phase I to phase III studies. Fremanezumab  demonstrated a very low incidence of adverse events. Primary and secondary endpoints in randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy of fremanezumab were  achieved. Fremanezumab was demonstrated to be able to reduce the number of  migraine days, headache hours and number of days with use of acute treatment agents. No data on drug-drug interactions with fremanezumab are available.  However, it is worth mentioning that fremanezumab showed a very low incidence of  development of adverse drug antibodies compared with other CGRP antibodies, Context: designed phase I/II trials has been a landmark success in clinical cancer  research and contributes a new era of oncogenic targeted therapy characterized  by elegant clinical trial design. In this review, we aim to present the current  knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK  inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to  review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and  results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its  accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the  updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent  alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also  presented, Context: therapy versus standard chemotherapy, but mutations conferring resistance to  treatment develop in most cases. The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib  was approved in 2014 for the treatment of ALK-mutated NSCLC in patients who are  intolerant or develop resistance to crizotinib. In a clinical trial of ceritinib  involving 130 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the majority of whom had  experienced disease progression during crizotinib use, patients receiving at  least 400 mg of ceritinib daily had an overall response rate of 56% and median  PFS of seven months. Adverse effects commonly reported with the use of either  drug include visual disturbances, gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., diarrhea), and liver enzyme abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The tyrosine kinase inhibitors crizotinib and ceritinib provide an  effective treatment approach for patients with ALK-mutated NSCLC. Efficacy data for both crizotinib and ceritinib indicate improved response rates and PFS with  the use of either drug as an alternative to standard chemotherapy","24670165, 25258279, 31050694, 25458559, 26294238","Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.","24891360, 24675041, 24980964, 26018086, 25258279, 25381900, 25101329, 25258420, 24670165, 25228534, 25733882, 25170107, 25458559"
Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, based on the context, there exists a deep learning system that can detect melanoma with higher accuracy than some dermatologists. This was demonstrated in a study where the deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy","Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating  characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean  receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71,  P = .001). LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice.

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification.

RESULTS: A multi-step approach combining microarray miRNA and mRNA expression  profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the CRC specific  miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. First, 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and  2916 mRNAs from CRC samples and their corresponding normal epithelial tissues  were identified by miRNA and mRNA microarray, respectively. Secondly, 22  dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target mRNAs (72 miRNA-mRNA pairs) were  identified by a combination of Pearson's correlation analysis and prediction by databases TargetScan and miRanda. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these  miRNA-mRNAs pairs were involved in Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, 6  up-regulated miRNAs (mir-21, mir-223, mir-224, mir-29a, mir-29b, and mir-27a) and 4 down-regulated predicted target mRNAs (SFRP1, SFRP2, RNF138, and KLF4)  were selected to validate the expression level and their anti-correlationship in  an extended cohort of CRC patients by qRT-PCR. Except for mir-27a, the, Context: PURPOSE: Although microRNAs have recently been recognized as riboregulators of  gene expression, little is known about microRNA expression profiles in serous  ovarian carcinoma. We assessed the expression of microRNA and the association  between microRNA expression and the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and  eight patients treated for benign uterine disease between December 2000 and  September 2003 were enrolled in this study. The microRNA expression profiles  were examined using DNA microarray and Northern blot analyses. RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a,  miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially  expressed in >16 patients. In addition, the expression levels of some microRNAs were correlated with the survival in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma.

It seems that microRNAs act as major regulators of gene  expression. In this review, we discuss microRNAs' role in cancer and how  microRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their gene targets.  Bioinformatic analysis of putative miRNA binding sites has indicated several  novel potential gene targets involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastatic  mechanisms. Matching computational prediction analysis together with microarray  data seems the best method for microRNA gene target identification. MicroRNAs  together with transcription factors generate a complex combinatorial code regulating gene expression. Thus, manipulation of microRNA-transcription factor  gene networks may be provides a novel approach for developing cancer therapies, Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies.

The key aims of the experiment were to  examine darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide with respect to (a)  assessment of in vitro metabolic stability and protein binding and (b)  characterization of in vivo oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics in mice. METHODS: In vitro (liver microsomes stability and protein binding) and in vivo  experiments (oral/intravenous dosing to mice) were carried out using  darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,Rdarolutamide. Besides, tissue levels of  darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide were measured following oral  and intravenous dosing. Appropriate plasma/tissue samples served to determine the pharmacokinetics of various analytes in mice.

The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l, which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway, Context: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits  following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv). TRH had  no effect on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min post-treatment in rabbits pre-treated with the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 hr  before TRH treatment, iv), but the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine did  not affect these responses to TRH. Experiments in vitro show that although TRH (10(-3) to 10(-8) M) had no direct effects on the isolated heart, left atrium,  and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and  dopamine on the left atrium.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"Yes, the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is AAUAAA. This hexamer is present in 41.9% of the identified polyadenylation signals and is considered to be a ""functional""","Context: hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors, Context:  A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in  silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants  that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were  identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at  least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these  hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347  terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were, Context: collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation, Context: and 35.3%, respectively). Western blotting revealed that the activity of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p34(cdc2) was significantly  decreased in oocytes and cumulus cells treated with 3'-dA at a concentration of  1 microg/ml or greater. To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms,  expression patterns and polyadenylation states of four important genes, C-mos,  cyclin B, GDF9 and BMP15, were studied as representative maternal transcripts by  real-time PCR and the PAT assay. 3'-dA at concentrations above 1 microg/ml  significantly prevented polyadenylation and caused aberrant expression of C-mos  and GDF9 during oocyte maturation. These results suggest that polyadenylation inhibitor blocked pig oocyte maturation in vitro by one or more of the following  actions: (1) inactivation of MAPK and MPF in oocytes, especially at the late  stages (MI and MII); (2) prevention of cumulus cell expansion through inactivation of cellular MAPK; and (3) inhibition of the maternal mRNA  polyadenylation process, which in reverse, disrupted the maternal mRNA patterns  in pig oocytes' maturation in vitro, Context: are two sequences with 75% homology to the consensus sequence,  (C/T)GTGTT(C/T)(C/T), identified by McLauchlan et al.

What is CPX-351,CPX-3,"Context: PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this  liposomal formulation.  METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a  phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy  was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m2). We developed a  population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and  daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required  two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal  volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal  clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than  published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the  liposome, Context: AML is highest. Therapeutic options mainly consist of hypomethylating agents,  ongoing clinical trials and, less commonly, intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.  CPX-351, a novel liposomal formulation which encapsulates cytarabine and  daunorubicin in 5:1 molar ratio, has shown promising efficacy, leading to recent  US FDA approval for front-line therapy for patients with therapy-related AML and  AML with myelodysplasia-related changes based on a large multicenter Phase III  clinical trial. This review summarizes the clinical development of CPX-351 as  induction therapy, Context: AIMS: To investigate the effects of methotrexate (MTX) on the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of CP-690,550, a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development as a  therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to determine the effects of multiple  doses of CP-690,550 on the PK of MTX, and to evaluate the short-term safety and  tolerability of co-administration of CP-690,550 and MTX. METHODS: This was a fixed-dose drug-drug interaction study. Twelve patients diagnosed with RA for at least 6 months were enrolled in a Phase I, open-label  study of the PK of multiple doses of CP-690,550 (30 mg b.i.d.) and single doses  of MTX (15-25 mg per week). RESULTS: All patients completed the study and were evaluated for PK and safety.  CP-690,550 exposure was not affected by co-administration with MTX; AUC(12)  ratio (CP-690,550 + MTX/CP-690,550) was 103.06% [90% confidence interval (CI), Context: treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. In a pivotal  phase 3 study that evaluated 309 patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly  diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia, CPX-351 significantly  improved median overall survival versus conventional 7 + 3 chemotherapy  (cytarabine continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin for 3 days), with a  comparable safety profile. A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease  or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare  survival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11,  2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient was partitioned into 3 health states: TOX (time with any grade 3 or 4 toxicity  or prior to remission), TWiST (time in remission without relapse or grade 3 or 4  toxicity), and REL (time after relapse). Within each treatment arm, Q-TWiST was, Context: risk : benefit profile at least similar to biologic therapies, be more  convenient for the patient and, hopefully, be less expensive.

RECENT FINDINGS: Additional information has become available in the past year on  five oral compounds including kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, fostamatinib,  VX-509), an S1P lyase inhibitor (LX 3305) and a chemokine receptor-1 antagonist  (CCX354-C). Efficacy has been shown in phase III with tofacitinib and in phase  II with fostamatinib and VX-509; safety was the primary endpoint of the trials  of CCX354-C and LX3305. Regarding side effects, liver test elevation and neutropenia occurred with tofacitinib, VX-509 and fostamatinib; lipid elevation  with tofacitinib and VX-509; creatinine elevation and anemia with tofacitinib,  and hypertension and diarrhea with fostamatinib.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker. It binds to phosphatidylserine which is exposed on the outer membrane of apoptotic cells. This property makes it a convenient marker for identifying apoptotic","Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues, Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process, Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF  expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells, Context: reliability of this method. By comparing the comet assay with a flow cytometry  method that uses Annexin V binding to apoptotic cells, we have provided further  evidence for evaluating the usefulness of the comet assay for detecting  apoptosis.  METHODS: Apoptosis was induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) by ionizing radiation and measured using the comet assay and a flow  cytometry method that measures Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining.  RESULTS: The Annexin V flow cytometry assay distinguished among early apoptosis,  late apoptosis, and an apoptotic or necrotic phase in which the cells were  labeled with both Annexin V and PI. The comet assay detected only the latter two phases of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The comet assay is a useful tool for measuring the late stages of  apoptosis whereas the Annexin V assay measures higher amounts of apoptosis  because it can detect cells in an earlier stage of the apoptotic pathway","7812008, 16331047, 7622868, 16737615, 12116376","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"

Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as  the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signalling suggested Tcf3-β-catenin  activation of target genes would stimulate self-renewal, here we show that an  antagonistic relationship between Wnt3a and Tcf3 on gene expression regulates  ESC self-renewal. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 replaced the requirement for  exogenous Wnt3a or GSK3 inhibition for ESC self-renewal, demonstrating that inhibition of Tcf3 repressor is the necessary downstream effect of Wnt  signalling. Interestingly, both Tcf3-β-catenin and Tcf1-β-catenin interactions  contributed to Wnt stimulation of self-renewal and gene expression, and the combination of Tcf3 and Tcf1 recruited Wnt-stabilized β-catenin to Oct4 binding  sites on ESC chromatin.

Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern  similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse  ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as  attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In  addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed  in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown.

However, the role of large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in  this regulatory circuitry and their underlying mechanism remains undefined.  Here, we demonstrate that a lincRNA, linc-RoR, may function as a key competing  endogenous RNA to link the network of miRNAs and core TFs, e.g., Oct4, Sox2, and  Nanog. We show that linc-RoR shares miRNA-response elements with these core TFs  and that linc-RoR prevents these core TFs from miRNA-mediated suppression in  self-renewing human ESC.

Only about 4% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged  nalmefene, whereas up to 60% was excreted as a beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase  hydrolysable conjugate(s) of nalmefene. In the second study, six healthy men  were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were  obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours. A dosing schedule of 20 mg  q12h was then started and continued for seven days. Plasma samples were  collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no  clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day  administration period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Context: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common syndrome characterised by widespread pain and at  least 11/18 painful tender points that requires multimodal pharmacological  treatment also combined with non-pharmacological therapy. Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: cardiac death should be considered in all affected persons. Standard care is  recommended for cardiovascular malformations and extracardiac malformations such  as syndactyly and hypoglycemia. Prevention of primary manifestations:  Arrhythmias must be prevented with the standard therapy. Because anesthesia is a  known trigger for cardiac arrhythmia, close cardiac monitoring is warranted  during surgery. Fever can be a trigger for arrhythmias in individuals with  CACNA1C-related Brugada syndrome and requires aggressive treatment with standard  antipyretic drugs. Surveillance: Cardiac and neurologic evaluations every six to  12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs reported to prolong QT interval; drugs and dietary practices that could lead to hypoglycemia. Evaluation of  relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of the older  and younger at-risk relatives of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from a complete cardiac evaluation and  institution of measures to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.

The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded, Context: of LACE Index for Readmission - Length of stay (days), Acute (emergent)  admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of ED visits within six months  (LACE) and Patients At Risk of Hospital Readmission (PARR) using New Zealand  hospital admissions. This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the  PARR index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity  of 0.542, Context: Predictive models for hospital readmission rates are in high demand because of  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Readmission  Reduction Program (HRRP). The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed  during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during  the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in  the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative  (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated  across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded  that of the LACE index. INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge  death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows  analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes","23696773, 23696773, 30040677, 29148921, 23696773","The LACE index is a simple tool that includes 4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months.

Core body temperature completely lost robust circadian rhythm  and acquired a 6-h rhythm with a low amplitude under LD 3:3.

Circadian expression of Dbp, a clock-controlled gene, was also disrupted in these tissues from mice housed under LD 3:3.

Owing to the multitude of systemic signalling pathway involved in  the phase resetting of peripheral clocks the disruption of any particular one  has only minor effects on the steady state phase of circadian gene expression in organs such as the liver.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. The context mentions that patients with an increased frequency of recombination have a higher frequency of cancer. Additionally, genetic disorders such as Ataxia telangie","Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context:  DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair. This review presents the  main mechanisms and pathways of homologous recombination repair, Context: This work focuses on the main DNA repair pathways, highlighting their role in  gastrointestinal carcinogenesis and the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),  mutations being described in several tumor types, including those of the  gastrointestinal tract. The mismatch repair (MMR) system is inherently altered  in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, and plays a role in  carcinogenesis in a subset of sporadic colorectal, gastric and esophageal  cancers. Alterations in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous  end-joining (NHEJ) also contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. Gene  polymorphisms of some X-ray cross-complementing (XRCCs), cofactor proteins involved in the base excision repair pathway, have been investigated in relation  to gastric, colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Yet only one polymorphism, XRCC1  Arg194Trp, appears to be involved in smoking-related cancers and in early onset pancreatic cancer. Although evidence in the literature indicates that mtDNA  somatic mutations play a role in gastric and colorectal carcinogenesis, no sound  conclusions have yet been drawn regarding this issue in pancreatic cancer,","12488587, 12427531, 23675572, 22276468, 17397816",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1 are mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki. These genes are part of the Hippo pathway, which controls organ size in flies and","Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five  sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein, Context: Elav-positive neurons and the fat body of Drosophila third instar larvae.  Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a  lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly  with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Accordingly,  centromeres reside closer to the nuclear lamina in neurons than in Kc167 cells.  As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc  domains. These domains are occupied by silent or weakly expressed genes with  genes residing in the HP1a-bound LADs expressed at the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS: In various differentiated Drosophila cell types, we discovered the existence of peripheral heterochromatin, similar to that observed in mammals.  Our findings support the model that peripheral heterochromatin matures enhancing  the repression of unwanted genes as cells terminally differentiate, Context: including humans, in a high-throughput manner. Here, we report, for the first  time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the  Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved  transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took  advantage of the very recently developed ""unit assembly"" strategy to assemble  two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex  chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently  injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2% of the injected F(0) fertile flies,  we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable  modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications  of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed","10772900, 17980593, 11528505, 30384843, 22624882",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities. We present a  model in which an alpha-independent beta-Kap progenitor gave rise to the  alpha-dependent beta-Kaps and the alpha-Kaps","22648805, 26888428, 25451386, 26888428, 9391096","mTOR, TOG5,  DNA-PKcs, HEATR1, Rif1, B56γ, PR65/A, SF3b155, Pds5B","27072897, 26676747, 27549742, 28512144, 27066066, 20007090, 28415797, 28668119, 24120762, 22315229"
What is protein palmitoylation?,"Yes, protein palmitoylation is the reversible attachment of a 16-carbon fatty acid (palmitate) to cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester linkage. This modification anchors","Context:  Protein S-palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM)  in blood stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. S-palmitoylation  refers to reversible covalent modification of cysteine residues of proteins by saturated fatty acids. In vivo, palmitoylation is regulated by concerted  activities of DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases (DHHC PATs) and acyl protein  thioesterases (APTs), which are enzymes responsible for protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, respectively. Here, we investigate the role of protein  palmitoylation in red blood cell (RBC) invasion by P. falciparum merozoites. We  demonstrate for the first time that free merozoites require PAT activity for, Context: impaired skin barrier function. As stratum corneum (SC) lipids have a crucial  role in the skin barrier function, we investigated the SC lipid composition and  organization in NTS patients. We studied the SC lipid composition by means of  mass spectrometry, and the lipid organization was examined by infrared  spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Decreased free fatty acid (FFA) chain length  and increased levels of monounsaturated FFAs were observed in the SC of NTS  patients compared with controls. Furthermore, the level of short-chain ceramides  (CERs) was enhanced in NTS patients and a strong reduction in long-chain CER  levels was seen in several patients. The changes in lipid composition modified the lipid organization leading to an increased disordering of the lipids  compared with the controls. In addition, in a subgroup of patients the  organization of the lipid layers changed dramatically. The altered FFA and CER profiles in NTS patients corresponded to changes in the expression of enzymes  involved in SC lipid processing. The observed changes in lipid composition,  lipid organization, and enzyme expression are likely to contribute to the, Context: Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are lipid anchors allowing the exposure of  proteins at the outer layer of the plasma membrane. In fungi, a number of  GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are involved in the remodeling of the cell wall  polymers. GPIs follow a specific biosynthetic pathway in the endoplasmic  reticulum. After the transfer of the protein onto the GPI-anchor, a lipid  remodeling occurs to substitute the diacylglycerol moiety by a ceramide. In addition to GPI-APs, A. fumigatus produces a GPI-anchored polysaccharide, the  galactomannan (GM), that remains unique in the fungal kingdom. To investigate  the role of the GPI pathway in the biosynthesis of the GM and cell wall organization, the deletion of PER1-coding for a phospholipase required for the  first step of the GPI lipid remodeling-was undertaken. Biochemical  characterization of the GPI-anchor isolated from GPI-APs showed that the PER1, Context:  Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid  (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a  thioester linkage. Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer.  NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular  loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation  site is conserved through most metazoan phlya.

Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) analog, used in  pulmonary hypertension, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory functions.  However, little is known about its role in the MIP-1α production in human  monocytes.  METHODS: We investigated the effects of 3 conventional (iloprost, beraprost, and  treprostinil) and 1 new (ONO-1301) PGI2 analogs, on the expression of MIP-1α  expression in human monocytes. Human primary monocytes from control subjects and  THP-1 cell line were treated with PGI2 analogs, with or without  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression).

A functional polymorphism in the human MAOA gene (high-  and low-MAOA) has been associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. To investigate directly the biological mechanism whereby this polymorphism  influences brain function, we recently measured the activity of the MAO A enzyme  in healthy volunteers. When found no relationship between the individual's brain MAO A level and the MAOA genotype, we postulated that there are additional  regulatory mechanisms that control the MAOA expression.

Another related disease, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy  (DRPLA) is also caused by an unstable triplet repeat and can present as SCA in late onset patients. We investigated the frequency of the SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3  and DRPLA mutations in 328 Brazilian patients with SCA, belonging to 90  unrelated families with various patterns of inheritance and originating in, Context:  Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an  autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat  expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range  in Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70  clinical SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further  used in SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions.

However, the importance of these transcriptional alterations in the pathogenesis  of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 remains unclear, Context:  AIMS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar  ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding  ataxin-3. The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the  loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the  cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. They can be employed in the treatment of both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells. However, issues related to vector expression and genotoxicity have limited their ther","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context: of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis  by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes.  Co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter  could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR), Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level.

However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss.

It shows complete  penetrance and variable expressivity and has been linked to the TWIST gene on  chromosome 7p21; more than 80 different intragenic mutations and, recently,  large deletions have been detected in Saethre-Chotzen patients. The aim of this  study was to genetically and phenotypically characterize patients with a  clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic  diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 34) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome are brachycephaly (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad,  depressed nasal bridge (65 percent), a high forehead (56 percent), ptosis (53 percent), and prominent auricular crura (56 percent). Furthermore, using  different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were  identified in 71 percent of patients, Context: phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper  eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild  cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow,  fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is  thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed  in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to  distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already  made in a family member, Context:  BACKGROUND: Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous  phenotype. The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the  authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008). Their phenotype, need for  primary cranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperation  were recorded. Genetic records were reviewed to identify each patient's TWIST1  mutation, Context: additional malformations and without chromosome breakage, who fits this narrow  definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation  in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the  protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk  for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance.  Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation,  while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is  very low, Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome  7p21.2.

Then, five levels of the five factors above were further optimized using the  CCD. Finally, the optimal parameters obtained with the RSM were the initial moisture 61.5%, inoculum 2.75%, the amount ratio of wheat bran to rice husk  0.42, temperature 29 degrees C, pH 5.5. Under the optimized conditions, 420.9 U  g(-1) of dry substrate of inulinase activity was reached in the solid-state, Context: emergency departments who had received a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack.  Physicians completed data forms with the ABCD2 score before disposition. The  outcome criterion, stroke, was established by a treating neurologist or by an  Adjudication Committee. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity for  predicting stroke 7 and 90 days after visiting the emergency department using  the original ""high-risk"" cutpoint of an ABCD2 score of more than 5, and the  American Heart Association recommendation of a score of more than 2. RESULTS: We enrolled 2056 patients (mean age 68.0 yr, 1046 (50.9%) women) who  had a rate of stroke of 1.8% at 7 days and 3.2% at 90 days. An ABCD2 score of more than 5 had a sensitivity of 31.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-47.5)  for stroke at 7 days and 29.2% (95% CI 19.6-41.2) for stroke at 90 days. An  ABCD2 score of more than 2 resulted in sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 82.7-98.5) for stroke at 7 days with a specificity of 12.5% (95% CI 11.2-14.1).

The text mentions its approval as a CAR T-cell product for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell","Context: CAR T-cells have transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with  relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Currently, three CAR T-cell  products are approved or soon to be approved: axicabtagene ciloleucel,  tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel. These products differ in  construct, manufacturing, clinical trial design and toxicity profile. Patient  selection for CAR T-cells, and the ideal product for a given patient, involves myriad considerations including age, fitness, prior therapies, comorbid  diseases, organ function, logistics of administration, turnaround time, and  institutional familiarity. This article reviews the proper patient and product selection for the management of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive  B-cell lymphomas, Context: destruction of tumor nests was seen by CGP41251 administration. In both tumor  tissues, the PKC activity of the particulate fraction was significantly  decreased by CGP41251 treatment. From these results, it is thought that the  antitumor activity of CGP41251 against human NSCLS is accompanied by the  decrease of PKC activity in the particulate fraction. Moreover, the G2/M arrest  of the cell cycle induced by CGP41251 might be important for the growth  inhibitory action of this compound, Context: The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (referred to hereafter as  ""mitoribosome"") is protein-rich, containing nearly twice as much protein as the  Escherichia coli ribosome. In order to produce soluble mitochondrial proteins  and protein-deficient subribosomal particles for use in functional and  structural studies, the proteins of bovine mitoribosomes were extracted by  washing in a series of buffers containing increasing concentrations of LiCl as  the only chaotropic agent. LiCl disruption is used in order to preserve the  solubilized proteins in a substantially ""native"" configuration. The extraction  mixtures were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis and the compositions of the stripped protein and residual pellet fractions were  determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to  analyze the behavior or individual proteins, the intensity of Coomassie blue stain for each protein was normalized against the intensity of stain for the  same protein in a control sample.

Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat  patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an  immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to  determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence.

Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,"No, according to the context, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that surgical treatment of endometrioma improves fertility outcomes over medical treatment. A study comparing surgical removal versus expectant management of endometrioma on ovar","Context:  OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs. PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher, Context: recommended for women above the age of 40 and for large endometriomas. Except  for pelvic clearance, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that surgical  treatment of endometrioma is better than medical treatment with respect to the  long-term relief of symptoms and quality of life. Laparoscopic excision of  ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over  expectant management. A large, well-designed, adequately powered randomized  controlled study that compares the effects of surgical removal versus expectant  management of endometrioma on ovarian performance and pregnancy outcomes in  women undergoing IVF is warranted, Context: visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the  non-operated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients  who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower  antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with  non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present  ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and  live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF  outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of  endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins, Context: natural pregnancy rate in the control group. Pregnancy rates in patients  receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15)  before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively. In post-menopausal women, the  median (quartile) age at menopause was similar in the study (n=9) and control  groups (n=6) [48 (45-52) versus 49 (44-52) years, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced  long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no  contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve  the success rates of fertility treatment, Context: OBJECTIVES: Endometriomas are rare in pregnancy. May be difficult to diagnose  and may cause significant complications at any stage during gestation.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to this en","Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus  formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and  adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells.

RNA editing by adenosine  deamination (A-to-I) is widespread in humans and can lead to a variety of  biological effects depending on the RNA type or the RNA region involved in the  editing modification. Hereafter, we describe an easy and reproducible  computational protocol for the identification of candidate RNA editing sites in  human using deep transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and genome (DNA-Seq) sequencing data, Context: RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there  is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase,  RNA-specific) targets. Here we explore natural genetic variation affecting  editing levels of particular sites in 81 natural strains of Drosophila  melanogaster. The analysis of associations between editing levels and  single-nucleotide polymorphisms allows us to map putative cis-regulatory regions  affecting editing of 16 A-to-I editing sites (cis-RNA editing quantitative trait  loci or cis-edQTLs, P < 10(-8)). The observed changes in editing levels are  validated by independent molecular technique. All identified regulatory variants are located in close proximity of modulated editing sites. Moreover, colocalized  editing sites are often regulated by same loci. Similar to expression and  splicing QTL studies, the characterization of edQTLs will greatly expand our understanding of cis-regulatory evolution of gene expression, Context:  BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a co-transcriptional modification that increases the  molecular diversity, alters secondary structure and protein coding sequences by  changing the sequence of transcripts. The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A→I) that is catalyzed by the members of the  Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are  identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the context provides information about several interaction partners for the protein GATA-1. These include FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, CTCF, Rad","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: The activity of hematopoietic factor GATA-1 is modulated through  p300/CBP-mediated acetylation and FOG-1 mediated indirect interaction with  HDAC1/2 containing NuRD complex. Although GATA-1 acetylation is implicated in  GATA-1 activation, the role of deacetylation is not studied. Here, we found that  the FOG-1/NuRD does not deacetylate GATA-1. However, HDAC1/2 can directly bind  and deacetylate GATA-1. Two arginine residues within the GATA-1 linker region mediates direct interaction with HDAC1. The arginine to alanine mutation (2RA)  blocks GATA-1 deacetylation and fails to induce erythroid differentiation. Gene  expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis further demonstrate the importance of GATA-1 deacetylation for gene activation and chromatin recruitment.

Which proteins does RG-7992 target?,"No, the context does not provide information about RG-7992. It only mentions RG7112 which is a small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding","Context: MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2  as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding  that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for  cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of  MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with  high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule  binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53  amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell  lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response, Context: METHODS: We report here the making of MRG002, a novel HER2-targeted antibody  drug conjugate (ADC), and preclinical characterization including pharmacology,  pharmacodynamics and toxicology and discuss its potential as a novel agent for  treating patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. RESULTS: MRG002 exhibited similar antigen binding affinity but much reduced  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity compared to  trastuzumab. In addition to potent in vitro cytotoxicity, MRG002 showed tumor  regression in both high- and medium-to-low HER2 expressing in vivo xenograft  models. Furthermore, MRG002 showed enhanced antitumor activity when used in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Main findings from toxicology studies  are related to the payload and are consistent with literature report of other  ADCs with monomethyl auristatinE. CONCLUSION: MRG002 has demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and potent  antitumor activities in the breast and gastric PDX models with varying levels of  HER2 expression, and/or resistance to trastuzumab or T-DM1. A phase I clinical, Context: cancer cases and is thus responsible for a substantial proportion of cancer  deaths. Consequently, KRAS has been the subject of exhaustive drug-targeting  efforts over the past 3-4 decades. These efforts have included targeting the  KRAS protein itself but also its posttranslational modifications, membrane  localization, protein-protein interactions and downstream signalling pathways.  Most of these strategies have failed and no KRAS-specific drugs have yet been  approved. However, for one specific mutation, KRASG12C , there is light on the  horizon. MRTX849 was recently identified as a potent, selective and covalent  KRASG12C inhibitor that possesses favourable drug-like properties. MRTX849 selectively modifies the mutant cysteine residue in GDP-bound KRASG12C and  inhibits GTP-loading and downstream KRAS-dependent signalling. The drug inhibits  the in vivo growth of multiple KRASG12C -mutant cell line xenografts, causes tumour regression in patient-derived xenograft models and shows striking  responses in combination with other agents. It has also produced objective  responses in patients with mutant-specific lung and colorectal cancer. In this, Context: The p53 tumor suppressor is a potent transcription factor that plays a key role  in the regulation of cellular responses to stress. It is controlled by its  negative regulator MDM2, which binds directly to p53 and inhibits its  transcriptional activity. MDM2 also targets p53 for degradation by the  proteasome. Many tumors produce high levels of MDM2, thereby impairing p53  function. Restoration of p53 activity by inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction may  represent a novel approach to cancer treatment. RG7112 (2g) is the first  clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket  of MDM2. In cancer cells expressing wild-type p53, RG7112 stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and  inhibition or regression of human tumor xenografts, Context: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence  of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. PROCEDURES: RG7112 and its inactive enantiomer RG7112i were evaluated against  the 23 cell lines of the PPTP in vitro panel using 96 hours exposure (1 nM to 10  µM).

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, ficolin-3 activates the lectin complement pathway. This is stated explicitly in the first and fourth contexts, where it mentions that ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway","Context: concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has  been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of  Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we  report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal  bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and  calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and  displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells'  response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial  pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common  pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause  extraintestinal, opportunistic infections, Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The  following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World  Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as  neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral  ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and  6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.  RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with  controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was  reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia.  Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with  unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain  injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters. These results support  the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to, Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators, Context: Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition  molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic  variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene  was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms  was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by  production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied  10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several  polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was  particularly interesting. In individuals heterozygous for the FCN3+1637delC  deletion lowered Ficolin-3 concentration was observed (P=0.025).

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, bats are thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS. The virus was closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU","Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed, Context: A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the  causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012. The virus was  termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is taken  notice of important coronavirus caused severe diseases to human after the  outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. There is a lot  of unknown characterization regarding MERS-CoV because of less than one year  after finding the first case. MERS-CoV was related to the 2C betacoronavirus  clade and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and  Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Thus, bats are thought to be natural hosts of this virus. Recently, there were reports supposed to be cases of human to human  infection. There are growing concerns about spread of infection, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures  against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans.

In 2012, a new human disease called  Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was  caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical  Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory  tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the  death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown,  but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may  sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human  transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further  understanding the virus-host interactions that govern disease severity and  infection outcome.

The association, then, should be tested in  other populations to clarify the possible involvement, if any, of the TNFR2  polymorphism in SLE or other related autoimmune diseases.

We found no association at all between the TNFR2 polymorphism and any  autoimmune diseases including SLE in Japanese, Context:  Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors are considered to be involved  in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A number of previous  studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the  genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position  encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2). The purpose of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of TNFR2 and its possible association with the  susceptibility to SLE, using the case-control association analysis.

Such lack of consistency could partly derive from the population admixture involved  in the case-control study. To avoid such a problem, polymorphisms in these genes  were analyzed using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in Caucasian SLE families. Ninety-one Caucasian SLE family samples recruited in southern  California were analyzed for the association with HLA-DRB1, TNF promoter  positions at -1031, -863, -857 and -308, and TNFR2-196M/R polymorphisms, Context: Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors are considered to be involved  in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"Yes, interneuron-specific Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mice were developed to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. These mice have impaired growth and decreased survival,","Context: amplifies their signaling in T24 cells. GA downregulated Met by inhibiting new  protein maturation, thereby dampening HGF signaling. HGF and chemical hypoxia  with CoCl2 cooperatively promoted in vitro invasion and vascular endothelial  growth factor (VEGF) secretion, while CoCl2 but not HGF activated urokinase-type  plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase 2, both of which promote  invasion and angiogenesis. Low dose GA (100 nmol/L) inhibited these processes by  suppressing both HGF and HIF-1 pathways. Notably, brief GA pretreatment  inhibited in vitro invasion and VEGF secretion induced by HGF as effectively as  did continuous treatment. Moreover, we found that GA inhibited activation of focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion assembly, and actin reorganization induced  by HGF and integrin engagement by extracellular matrix. Thus, GA widely  suppresses extrinsic stimuli-induced signaling that contribute to tumor invasion and angiogenesis in this bladder carcinoma model, suggesting the utility of  Hsp90 inhibitors in preventing tumor progression and metastasis, Context: directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to  1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.  Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible  genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among  them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6, Context: contribution of increased mTORC1 signaling, specific abnormalities that underlie  the severe neurologic features in TSC remain poorly understood. We hypothesized  that epilepsy and autism in TSC result from abnormalities of γ-aminobutyric  acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we generated  conditional knockout mice with selective deletion of the Tsc1 gene in GABAergic  interneuron progenitor cells. These interneuron-specific Tsc1 conditional  knockout (CKO) mice have impaired growth and decreased survival. Cortical and  hippocampal GABAergic interneurons of CKO mice are enlarged and show increased  mTORC1 signaling. Total numbers of GABAergic cells are reduced in the cortex with differential reduction of specific GABAergic subtypes. Ectopic clusters of  cells with increased mTORC1 signaling are also seen suggesting impaired  interneuron migration. The functional consequences of these cellular changes are evident in the decreased seizure threshold on exposure to the proconvulsant  flurothyl. These findings support an important role for the Tsc1 gene during  GABAergic interneuron development, function, and possibly migration, Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that, Context: A substantial fraction of phenotypic differences between closely related species  are likely caused by differences in gene regulation. While this has already been  postulated over 30 years ago, only few examples of evolutionary changes in gene  regulation have been verified. Here, we identified and investigated binding  sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPa) aiming to  discover cis-regulatory adaptations on the human lineage. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments in a human cell line, we  found 11,619 putative GABPa binding sites. Through sequence comparisons of the  human GABPa binding regions with orthologous sequences from 34 mammals, we identified substitutions that have resulted in 224 putative human-specific GABPa  binding sites. To experimentally assess the transcriptional impact of those  substitutions, we selected four promoters for promoter-reporter gene assays","17525527, 21536806, 22021912, 30214018, 26814189",Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines is a data and tool resource to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.,27710791
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is explicitly stated in the context when it mentions that ""stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules"" and ""cytoplasmic FUS","Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist  longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular  change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state, Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN.

Entresto is composed of which two drugs?,"Yes, according to the context, Entresto is composed of valsartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) and sacubitril (a neprilysin inhibitor).","Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides.

This article  reviews the stages that led to the development of this drug, the failure of its  preceding agents, the lessons we have learnt, and the current trials of Entresto  for new indications, Context: WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity  and mortality worldwide. Advanced therapies have prolonged survival in patients  with advanced heart failure, but pharmacotherapeutic optimization remains the  mainstay of treatment. It has been over 10 years since the last  mortality-reducing medication has been approved by the Food and Drug  Administration. This article reviews the background, current knowledge and data  supporting the use of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto(®) ), the newly  FDA-approved medication that dually inhibits angiotensin and neprilysin, in the  treatment of heart failure. METHODS: A literature search was performed (January 1980 to August 2015) using  PubMed and the search terms were as follows: neprilysin inhibitor, heart  failure, endopeptidase, natriuretic peptides, angiotensin, omapatrilat, LCZ696, valsartan and sacubitril. Peer-reviewed, published clinical trials, review  articles, relevant treatment guidelines and prescribing information documents  were identified and reviewed for relevance. Additionally, reference citations, Context:  Entacapone (Comtess/Comtan) is Orion Pharma's original proprietary  catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor. Entacapone is able to slow down  degradation of levodopa and improve the availability and efficacy of each levodopa dose, hence its use as a complement to levodopa/carbidopa in patients  with Parkinson's disease. In order to simplify the daily dosing of these  medications, Orion has developed an entacapone/levodopa/carbidopa combination tablet. Three tablet strengths are being developed so as to cover the most  common clinical dosing needs. In September 2000, Orion signed a marketing and  distribution agreement with Novartis for the combination tablet.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children.

That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains, Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes.

Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle, Context: CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29  and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory  manifestations of H1N1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both  women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the  other recovered without any long-term consequence. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if  myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant  association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased  risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women.

Thrombophilia can be revealed by pregnancy.  Thrombotic risk during pregnancy and the puerperium is higher in asymptomatic women with than without thrombophilia. Antithrombin deficiency, combined  deficiencies and homozygous or double-heterozygotes factor V Leiden and factor  II G 20210 A mutations are associated with a higher thrombotic risk than heterozygote mutations or protein S and C deficiencies, whereas  hyperhomocysteinemia does not appear as a risk factor for maternal  thromboembolic disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome with lupus anticoagulant is, Context: placental abruption. We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period, Context: BACKGROUND: Although some paternal components to the predisposition to  pre-eclampsia have been demonstrated recently, it is not known whether such  paternal factors play a role to thrombophilia-related perinatal mortality.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the paternal and maternal contribution to perinatal  mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Data from a prospective registry of perinatal mortality in a Dutch  healthcare region were used. Between December 1999 and May 2000, the prevalence  of thrombophilia was studied in 74 women with a history of perinatal mortality  (female cases) and 54 of their male partners (male cases). Seventy-one healthy  unrelated women after uneventful pregnancies only and 66 of their male partners were used as controls. SETTING: Obstetric outpatient clinic in a regional hospital (Remierde Graaf  Group, Deflt). METHODS: Presence of various coagulation abnormalities, hyperhomocysteinaemia  and anticardiolipins was investigated. RESULTS: The frequency of antithrombin deficiency (12% vs 0%), increased  activated protein C (APC) resistance (32% vs 6%), total protein S deficiency  (11% vs 1%) and elevated factor VIII:C activity (43% vs 17%) was significantly, Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of  cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia","19031171, 15027582, 19031171, 15713144, 20860491","Thrombophilia has been found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin does have a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the context, it is mentioned that hesperidin exhibits neuroprotective effects and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, hes","Context: AIMS: There is increasing evidence showing that mild traumatic brain injury  (mTBI) is associated with increased depression-related disorders in humans.  Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural  flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury  and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its  neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse  model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the  antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid. MAIN METHODS: Ten days after mTBI-induction, mice received oral hesperidin  treatment (50 mg/kg/14 days), then animals were subjected to different  depression tests including sucrose preference test, forced swim test,, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line, Context: effects against a broad group of diseases. Citrus fruits and juices are a rich  source of vitamin C and flavonoids, with a potential effect on the inflammatory  response. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evidence the potential anti-inflammatory effects of  the flavonoids hesperidin for its possible therapeutic application against  diverse pathologies. METHOD: In the present review, available literature about the anti-inflammatory  effects of hesperidin is reported and discussed. Moreover, we also discuss the  chemistry, bioavailability and proposed mechanisms of action of hesperidin. RESULTS: Hesperidin is a flavonoid present in high concentration in citrus species and has numerous biological properties, principally antioxidant and  anti-inflammatory. Several studies have been performed in order to evaluate the  effects of hesperidin as anti-inflammatory agent using cellular and animal models and few clinical trials. Hesperidin treatment decreased inflammatory  mediators and exerted significant antioxidant effects. The molecular basis for  its anti-inflammatory effects seems to be mediated by signalling pathways, Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C.

Which disease the skin condition Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is associated to?,"Yes, Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is associated with diabetes mellitus. This association is mentioned in all of the provided contexts and it is a well-known fact that Necrobiosis lipoidica","Context: Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare skin disorder, usually considered a  marker for diabetes mellitus. More than half of the patients with necrobiosis  lipoidica diabeticorum have diabetes mellitus, but less than one per cent of  diabetes mellitus patients have necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. In the  diabetes and dermatology literature, we find the position that there is no  effect of glucose control on either the appearance of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum or the clinical course of the lesion. We base our challenge to this  position on a critical review of the original data. And conclude on the  contrary, that necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is usually associated with poor glucose control and that tighter glucose control, as currently practised,  might improve or prevent the disorder, Context:  Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an unusual dermatologic condition with a  characteristic clinical appearance and a clear association with diabetes  mellitus.

We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow.

All  of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the α-granule content by  immunofluorescence analysis for α-granule secretory proteins.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are substances that result from the bioactivation of xenobiotic compounds. They can form adducts with trapping reagents like glutathione, making them detectable even though they","Context: A predominant pathway of xenobiotic-induced toxicity is initiated by  bioactivation. Characterizing reactive intermediates will provide information on  the structure of reactive species, thereby defining a potential bioactivation  mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable. However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily, Context: Although idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are rare, they are still a major  concern to patient safety. Reactive metabolites are widely accepted as playing a  pivotal role in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. While  there are today well established strategies for the risk assessment of stable  metabolites within the pharmaceutical industry, there is still no consensus on  reactive metabolite risk assessment strategies. This is due to the complexity of  the mechanisms of these toxicities as well as the difficulty in identifying and  quantifying short-lived reactive intermediates such as reactive metabolites. In  this review, reactive metabolite risk and hazard assessment approaches are discussed, and their pros and cons highlighted. We also discuss the nature of  idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, using acetaminophen and nefazodone to  exemplify the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of reactive metabolite mediated hepatotoxicity. One of the key gaps moving forward is our understanding  of and ability to predict the contribution of immune activation in idiosyncratic  adverse drug reactions. Sections are included on the clinical phenotypes of, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity, Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction. Although the reactive metabolite hypothesis is logical,  it has important implications for drug development, and we need to develop ways, Context: identification of minor reactive metabolites are equally important since the  minor metabolites, even though at low levels, may be highly reactive and also  play an important role in drug-induced adverse reactions. In this study,  2-acetylthiophene, clozapine, troglitazone and 7-methylindole were selected as  model compounds to further validate the advantages of this method for rapid  detection and structural characterization of minor glutathione (GSH) adducts  derived from reactive metabolites. The utility of the current method was clearly  demonstrated by successful identification of novel reactive metabolites at low  levels and also minor ones either masked by non-specific responses or co-eluted with other conjugates. In comparison with existing methods, this method is  sensitive, efficient, and suitable for rapid screening and more complete  profiling of reactive metabolites","21469730, 26735163, 12093356, 17145699, 16235238","Reactive metabolites are generated when a small molecule, commonly a drug or hydrocarbon, is broken down in the body.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the features of Triple A syndrome include alacrima (absence of tear production), achalasia (a disorder of the esophagus causing difficulty in swallowing), and adrenal failure. Additionally, most patients","Context: ""Triple A"" syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive condition whose main clinical  features are alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal failure. Most patients also  develop some neurologic abnormalities. We describe an 11-year-old boy with  triple A syndrome who presented with progressive axonal motor neuropathy.  Molecular analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the AAAS gene,  confirming the clinical diagnosis. The clinical presentation of patients with  triple A syndrome is variable. Our patient manifested neurologic problems during  early childhood, before other features of this condition were apparent. We  highlight the neurologic presentation of this multisystem disorder. In the presence of complex axonal neuropathy, other features of this condition should  be sought, Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of, Context: change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported, Context:  ""Triple A"" syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive condition whose main clinical  features are alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal failure. Most patients also  develop some neurologic abnormalities. We describe an 11-year-old boy with triple A syndrome who presented with progressive axonal motor neuropathy.

In the, Context: achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this  patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The  parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin  brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol  rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a  genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation","22000320, 20200814, 29255950, 22000320, 18551317","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes, according to the context, CEP-2","Context: 2.0 ± 1.0 nM, respectively). CEP-26401 displayed potent antagonist and inverse  agonist activities in [³⁵S]guanosine 5'-O-(γ-thio)triphosphate binding assays.  After oral dosing of CEP-26401, occupancy of H₃R was estimated by the inhibition  of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (OCC₅₀ = 0.1 ± 0.003 mg/kg), and  antagonism of the H₃R agonist R-α-methylhistamine- induced drinking response in  the rat dipsogenia model was demonstrated in a similar dose range (ED₅₀ = 0.06  mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have, Context: significantly inhibited the growth of HT-29 cell xenograft in SCID mice, and the  mice survival was dramatically improved. At the same time, in xenografted tumors  administrated with AZD-2014, the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 were largely  inhibited, and autophagic markers were significantly increased. Thus, AZD-2014  inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Our results  suggest that AZD-2014 may be further investigated for colorectal cancer therapy  in clinical trials, Context: self-administration. Current studies show that bupropion facilitates the  acquisition of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats, further suggesting  that bupropion enhances the rewarding properties of nicotine. Bupropion has been  shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials, bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile, Context: aciclovir and L-valine, the essential amino acid. The mode of action and  spectrum of antiviral activity of valaciclovir are thus identical to aciclovir.  The bioavailability of aciclovir after valaciclovir, characterised from studies  in healthy adult volunteers, is similar in a wide range of patient populations,  including the elderly, those with advanced HIV disease, patients with impaired  liver or renal function, or undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No  clinically significant drug interactions with valaciclovir have so far been  identified. Dosage reductions in clinical use of valaciclovir are only necessary  when renal function is severely impaired. In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir  in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic  neuralgia. It is as effective as aciclovir in hastening rash healing. In patients with ophthalmic zoster, no differences were evident between  valaciclovir and aciclovir treatment on zoster-associated pain or the occurrence  of ocular complications. The safety profiles of valaciclovir, aciclovir and, Context:  Rasburicase is a new treatment for hyperuricemia, a metabolic manifestation of  tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Rasburicase has a unique mechanism of action that  allows uric acid byproducts to be easily excreted in the urine. Clinical trials have shown that rasburicase has a rapid onset of action that allows chemotherapy  to be delivered on time and prevents hyperuricemia-related complications,  including renal compromise. The drug has been used successfully in adults and children. The main side effect of rasburicase is the potential for a  hypersensitivity reaction. The drug is contraindicated in patients with glucose  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency because this can precipitate","22001260, 24309100, 17227286, 15989601, 11842483",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
