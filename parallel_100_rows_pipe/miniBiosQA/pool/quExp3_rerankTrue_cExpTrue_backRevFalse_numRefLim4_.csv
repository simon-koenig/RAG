What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. This is suggested by frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases and high expression of polycomb genes, which","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma","23179372, 23179372, 14688019, 19270706","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"H4K20me1.   This is mentioned in the first context where it says ""Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR","Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation  patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the  activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). Here, we show that  SET7, a known histone methyltransferase, is involved in the regulation of  protein stability of DNMT1. SET7 colocalizes and directly interacts with DNMT1  and specifically monomethylates Lys-142 of DNMT1. Methylated DNMT1 peaks during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle and is prone to proteasome-mediated  degradation. Overexpression of SET7 leads to decreased DNMT1 levels, and  siRNA-mediated knockdown of SET7 stabilizes DNMT1. These results demonstrate that signaling through SET7 represents a means of DNMT1 enzyme turnover, Context: limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone  marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further validated by experimentally confirming the transcription of two predicted  missing genes. Moreover, a sequence motif analysis was constructed in order to  identify the DH sites and many putative transcription factor binding sites, Context:  The SET domain contains the catalytic center of lysine methyltransferases that  target the N-terminal tails of histones and regulate chromatin function. Here we  report the structure of the SET7/9 protein in the absence and presence of its cofactor product, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). A knot within the SET  domain helps form the methyltransferase active site, where AdoHcy binds and  lysine methylation is likely to occur. A structure-guided comparison of sequences within the SET protein family suggests that the knot substructure and  active site environment are conserved features of the SET domain","27131378, 19282482, 23355544, 12389038",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

The product of this proto-oncogene is overexpressed in 25-30% of human breast cancer and is the target of selective immunotherapy. Concerned about the  ethnic differences on the expression of this oncogene, we have evaluated 143  consecutive specimens of primary breast cancer diagnosed in San Pablo Hospital, Puerto Rico. The specimens were analyzed for Her-2/neu expression using  immunohistochemistry assays (Hercept test). We have related the expression of  hormone receptor status, percent cells in S phase, DNA ploidy, tumor size, nodal, Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c.","Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-Î± plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: Vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the orthopoxvirus genus, encodes the  mitochondrial-localized protein F1L that functions to protect cells from  apoptotic death and inhibits cytochrome c release. We previously showed that F1L  interacts with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak and inhibits activation  of Bak following an apoptotic stimulus (Wasilenko, S. T., Banadyga, L., Bond,  D., and Barry, M. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 14031-14043). In addition to Bak, the  pro-apoptotic protein Bax is also capable of initiating cytochrome c release  suggesting that vaccinia virus infection could also inhibit Bax activity. Here  we show that F1L inhibits the activity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax by inhibiting oligomerization and N-terminal activation of Bax. F1L expression also  inhibited the subcellular redistribution of Bax to the mitochondria and the  insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane. The ability of F1L to inhibit Bax activation does not require Bak, because F1L expression inhibited  cytochrome c release and Bax activation in Bak-deficient cells. No interaction  between Bax and F1L was detected during infection, suggesting that F1L functions, Context: Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to  mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells.

However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,No. The context mentions that a mutation in the TR alpha1 gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone acts via receptor subtypes (TRÎ±1, TRÎ²1, TRÎ²2) with  differing tissue distributions, encoded by distinct genes (THRA, THRB). THRB  mutations cause a disorder with central (hypothalamic-pituitary) resistance to thyroid hormone action with markedly elevated thyroid hormone and normal TSH  levels. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review describes the clinical features, genetic and  molecular pathogenesis of a homologous human disorder mediated by defective THRA. Clinical features include growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia and  constipation associated with low-normal T4 and high-normal T3 levels and a low  T4/T3 ratio, together with subnormal reverse T3 levels. Heterozygous TRa1, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context:  Although different expression patterns of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1  and beta1 have been reported, no essential distinction has been established in  their functions. Unlike the TR beta gene, a mutation in the TR alpha1 gene has never been found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH).  Previously we found a mutant TR beta with an 11-carboxyl (C)-terminal amino acid  truncation (betaF451X) in a girl with severe RTH. BetaF451X is a natural mutant with disruption of the transactivation domain, tau4, and it had very strong  dominant negative activities. Based on the fact that the 46 amino acid sequence  in the extreme C-terminal region is identical in TR alpha1 and TR beta, except, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,Autosomal dominant.   This is mentioned in the first sentence of the provided text as a characteristic of FSHD.,"Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  Consensual diagnostic criteria for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) include  onset of the disease in facial or shoulder girdle muscles, facial weakness in  more than 50% of affected family members, autosomal dominant inheritance in familial cases, and evidence of myopathic disease in at least one affected  member without biopsy features specific to alternative diagnoses. Six patients  did not meet most of these criteria but were diagnosed as FSHD by DNA testing, which showed small EcoRI fragments on chromosome 4q.

In conclusion, this large-scale analysis provides further  information that should be taken into account when counselling families in which  a reduced allele with 4-8 D4Z4 repeats segregates. In addition, the reduced  expression of disease observed in distant relatives suggests that a family's  genetic background plays a role in the occurrence of facioscapulohumeral  muscular dystrophy.

Treatment must reduce pressure in the renal vasculature, otherwise  glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate.  Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a  suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles.

Therefore, it is necessary to search for new sources of therapies for the  treatment of these patients in order to improve their quality of life. From content analysis of literature of new therapeutic targets, there are various  targets and drugs reported to be promising for the treatment of asthma.  Interleukins involved in inflammatory processes are often presented as candidate targets for new drugs. The action of such therapeutics would not only affect  interleukins, but also their receptors.

The prognosis of metastatic STS is poor with a life  expectancy of 12-18 months. The mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy with an anthracycline. The addition of other chemotherapeutic agents to an anthracycline  has been studied with limited success in improving outcomes for STS patients.  Olaratumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFR-Î±) preventing binding of its  ligands and receptor activation. This drug recently received the US Food and  Drug Administration's accelerated approval for the treatment of advanced STS, Context: Ewing's sarcoma is a solid tumor of the bone that primarily occurs in children  and young adults. Most cases harbor the (11;22) (q24;q12) chromosomal  translocation that encodes the EWS/FLI oncoprotein. EWS/FLI is an aberrant  ETS-type transcription factor that dysregulates a number of genes important in  the development of Ewing's sarcoma. Because EWS/FLI is the key oncoprotein in  this tumor and ETS proteins are often dysregulated in various human cancers, Ewing's sarcoma serves as a useful paradigm for ETS-mediated oncogenesis. We  recently showed that EWS/FLI interacts with GGAA-microsatellites to regulate  some of its target genes, including NR0B1, an EWS/FLI-regulated gene that is required for the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma. While microsatellites  typically have no ascribed function, and are sometimes considered ""junk"" DNA,  our findings provide a unique role for microsatellites in cancer development, Context: rhabdomyosarcoma than for those with osteosarcoma (77%, 64%, and 26%,  respectively; P < 0.005).

At the time of last follow-up, 7 patients (10%) were alive without  progression: 3 with Ewing's sarcoma, 1 with osteosarcoma, and 3 with  rhabdomyosarcoma.  CONCLUSIONS: MAID chemotherapy is an active regimen in adults with advanced or  metastatic Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Although there was no direct  comparison with a doxorubicin and cisplatin-based regimen, the response rate and survival in patients with osteosarcoma suggest that doxorubicin and  cisplatin-based chemotherapy would remain the accepted initial chemotherapy  regimen.

Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation.

Our data further imply  that a diminished PML function may contribute to cell senescence, genomic  instability, and tumorigenesis, Context:  In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit both genetic and epigenetic  instability. These unique properties give rise to genetic and epigenetic  heterogeneity in a given population of cancer cells and provide a means for the population to undergo phenotypic progression by clonal selection. DNA  methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one of the epigenetic marks that are  frequently disturbed in cancer cells.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Symplekin, alpha-Kaps, beta-Kaps.","Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals.

Secondary-structural prediction  algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of  all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were  investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation.  The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts.

Among the most frequently  identified proteins, 380 proteins belonged to Lactobacillus spp., 155 belonged  to Clostridium spp., and 66 belonged to Streptococcus spp. The most frequently  identified proteins were heat shock chaperones, including 349 GroEL proteins,  from many bacterial species, whereas the most abundant enzymes were pyruvate  kinases, as judged by the number of peptides identified per protein (spectral counting). Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses revealed the functions and  locations of the identified proteins.

The context mentions that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.,"Context: Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid  [G.

Mol, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the, Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR)","16717285, 21247248, 7624311, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes. Tumour-specific antigens mostly arise by point mutations in known protein-coding genes, such as tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system.","Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs, Context: documented (reviewed in HÃ¤mmerling et al, 1987). However, the key question of  whether cytolytic T cell attack has a role in human cancer remains unsolved.  Similarly, the role of NK cells is unclear; these seem to lyse cells with low  levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss.

However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

Most patients tolerate statins well, but  approximately 10% to 20% experience side effects (primarily muscle-related)  contributing to diminished compliance or discontinuation of statin therapy and  subsequent increase in cardiovascular risk. Statin-intolerant patients require  more effective therapies for lowering LDL-C. Proprotein convertase  subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a compelling target for LDL-C-lowering  therapy.

In addition to two known binding partners  (HSP90, CDC37), 12 proteins were identified using the TAP assay; four of which  are mitochondrially localized (GRP75, HSP60, LRPPRC, and TUFM). Western blot  analysis showed no differences in cellular abundance of these proteins comparing  PINK1 mutant and control fibroblasts. When sequencing LRPPRC, four exonic  synonymous changes and 20 polymorphisms in noncoding regions were detected. Our  study provides a list of putative PINK1 binding partners, confirming previously  described interactions, but also introducing novel mitochondrial proteins as  potential components of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, Context: Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific  transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in  erythropoiesis. Our laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B promoter  region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription.

These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress.,"Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, TÂ cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance, Context: is regulated at the translational level. More recently, we have shown that in  cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein, MDR1 mRNA does not aggregate into  translationally silent stress granules. Importantly, this is not unique for  MDR1, since other transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins, and which are  thus translated at the endoplasmic reticulum, follow the same pattern. By using  a series of chimaeric transcripts, we have demonstrated that transcript  localization at the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the signals dictating stress  granule sequestration. Polysome profile analyses and protein synthesis  experiments indicate that, upon stress withdrawal, endoplasmic-reticulum-bound transcripts resume translation faster than those at the cytosol, which have been  sequestered into stress granules. This may represent a novel mechanism by which  drug-resistant cells respond quickly to stress, helping them to survive the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, Context: following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the  Z-DNA-binding domain (ZÎ±(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required  for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of  ZÎ±(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding  protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We  additionally show that the ZÎ± domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1,  E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we  show that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization.  We have thus identified a novel role for Z-DNA-binding domains in mammalian  cells, Context: following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,Mutations in the CREBBP gene cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.,"Context:  Mutations in the CREBBP (CREB-binding protein gene) cause Rubinstein-Taybi  syndrome (RSTS). At present, however, genetic testing of CREBBP is not commonly  applied in clinical settings because the currently available assays are technically and financially demanding, mainly because of the size of the gene.  In the present study, we took advantage of a highly sensitive and specific,  automated denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique. First, we developed a DHPLC-based protocol to analyze the entire coding region  of CREBBP. Second, we analyzed genetic samples from 21 RSTS patients using  DHPLC. The coding region was amplified by 41 primer pairs, all of which have the, Context: hypotonia and feeding difficulties. A routine chromosome analysis on 20  metaphase cells showed a normal 46, XX karyotype.

Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel Hâ‚ƒR antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: mg/kg).

CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context:  CEP-26401 is a novel orally active, brain-penetrant, high-affinity histamine H3  receptor (H3R) antagonist, with potential therapeutic utility in cognition  enhancement. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography.
