What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,The defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Restoration of expression of genes controlling H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.,"Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations","19270706, 19747111","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. These lncRNAs contain consensus Sam68 binding sites and their stability is affected by Sam68 deficiency.","Context: lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas  depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected.

Describe RIblast,"RIblast is a tool for rapid identification of weak similarity in large nucleotide sequence datasets. It was developed as an alternative to existing alignment tools such as BLAST and BLAT, which were found to be too slow for metagenomic analyses with next","Context: of viruses and phages, and in prokaryotic metagenomic sequences, as well as in  EST sequences with spliced-out introns. These bioinformatics tools were  demonstrated to have state-of-the-art accuracy and have been frequently used for  gene annotation in novel nucleotide sequences. An additional advantage of these  sequence-analysis tools is that the problem of algorithm parameterization is  solved automatically, with parameters estimated by iterative self-training  (unsupervised training), Context: BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is a powerful methodology to study microbial  communities, but it is highly dependent on nucleotide sequence similarity  searching against sequence databases. Metagenomic analyses with next-generation  sequencing technologies produce enormous numbers of reads from microbial  communities, and many reads are derived from microbes whose genomes have not yet  been sequenced, limiting the usefulness of existing sequence similarity search  tools. Therefore, there is a clear need for a sequence similarity search tool  that can rapidly detect weak similarity in large datasets. RESULTS: We developed a tool, which we named CLAST (CUDA implemented large-scale alignment search tool), that enables analyses of millions of reads and thousands  of reference genome sequences, and runs on NVIDIA Fermi architecture graphics  processing units. CLAST has four main advantages over existing alignment tools. First, CLAST was capable of identifying sequence similarities ~80.8 times faster  than BLAST and 9.6 times faster than BLAT. Second, CLAST executes global  alignment as the default (local alignment is also an option), enabling CLAST to","21901741, 25495907","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: show that, in vitro, TFL2/LHP1 binds to histone H3 di- or tri-methylated at  lysine 9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3), the marks recognized by HP1, and to histone H3  trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), the mark deposited by PRC2. However, in  vivo TFL2/LHP1 association with chromatin occurs almost exclusively and  co-extensively with domains marked by H3K27me3, but not H3K9me2 or -3. Moreover,  the distribution of H3K27me3 is unaffected in lhp1 mutant plants, indicating  that unlike PRC2 components, TFL2/LHP1 is not involved in the deposition of this  mark. Rather, our data suggest that TFL2/LHP1 recognizes specifically H3K27me3  in vivo as part of a mechanism that represses the expression of many genes  targeted by PRC2, Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By  generating a modification-specific antibody and yeast strains that harbor  mutations in the putative site of methylation, we provide evidence that this  mark exist in vivo. Importantly, we show that this lysine residue is highly  conserved through evolution, and provide evidence that this methylation event  also occurs in higher eukaryotes. By identifying a novel site of histone methylation, this study adds to our overall understanding of the complex number  of histone modifications that contribute to chromatin function","17542647, 21249157",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

What are the targets of pemigatinib?,"The targets of pexidartinib (not pemigatinib) are CSF1 receptor, KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 harboring an internal tandem","Context: Conventional cancer treatment modalities have several limitations including lack  of sufficient efficacy, serious untoward toxicity, as well as innate and  acquired drug resistance. In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify  patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus  allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a  desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface  of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain,  endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is  a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment.  With the development of FRα-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite, Context: Pexidartinib (TURALIO™) is an orally administered small molecule tyrosine kinase  inhibitor with selective activity against the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1)  receptor, KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) and FMS-like  tyrosine kinase 3 harboring an internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD).  In August 2019, the US FDA approved pexidartinib capsules for the treatment of  adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated  with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement  with surgery. This approval was based on positive results from the phase III  ENLIVEN trial. Pexidartinib is being investigated in various malignancies as monotherapy or combination therapy.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: amniotic fluid optical density readings were found in four samples (29%).  Overall, 12 of 54 fetuses (22%) with increased bowel echogenicity had a  detectable peak at 410 nm. Three of the 12 (25%) fetuses with echogenic bowel  and positive readings for hemoglobin were chromosomally abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal small bowel echogenicity is associated with the presence of  heme pigments in amniotic fluid as determined by amniotic fluid optical density  at 410 nm. Swallowing of amniotic fluid after intraamniotic bleeding seems  implicated in the etiology of second-trimester echogenic bowel in both euploid  and aneuploid fetuses, Context: switch in haemoglobin expression, as well as the fetal to adult switch that is  unique to humans and old world monkeys. We discuss the nature of these switches  and models of their regulation. The factors that have been suggested to regulate  this process are then discussed. With the increased understanding and discovery  of molecular regulators of haemoglobin switching, such as BCL11A, new avenues of  research may lead ultimately to novel therapeutic, mechanism-based approaches to  fetal haemoglobin reactivation in patients","8633653, 20201948","HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants modulate fetal hemoglobin via long-range MYB enhancers. Several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. Several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding, affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels.",24614105
Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,"No. The context only mentions BCG vaccine as the main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with no mention of avelumab.","Context: Intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the  main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with proven  effects on reducing recurrence, progression, and death from NMIBC. However, it  is not effective in all patients, and recurrence after adequate BCG therapy can  frequently lead to progression to more life-threatening disease. This  point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient  with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease,  that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of  induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full  course of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not  likely to work; this meets the new definition of a ""BCG unresponsive"" disease. For this situation, the safest (curative) option is removal of the bladder. If  that is not an accepted alternative, then a clinical trial or combination  intravesical chemotherapy or hyperchemotherapy may be another option, Context: cancers. Importantly, hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA of 90%  (18/20) superficial tumors with negative or atypia cytology. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of E-cadherin, p14 or RASSF1A in urine sediment  DNA is a potential biomarker for detecting superficial, low grade cancer.  Besides, hypermethylation of these 3 genes is a valuable adjunct diagnostic  marker to urine cytology, which can enhance the diagnostic accuracy and  follow-up treatment of bladder cancer patients","31307960, 19181545","Yes, avelumab is effective treatment of bladder cancer.","29103968, 29606979, 29784744, 29644490, 28864844, 28493171, 29540084, 29069302, 28214651, 29416316, 28982750"
HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,The EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) family.,"Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases. Likewise, the highest concentrations of this oncoprotein are found in patients with breast cancer, but lower concentrations  may be found in other malignancies, particularly ovarian, prostate and lung  cancer (mainly adenocarcinomas). HER-2/neu assay sensitivity in patients with, Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria was partially prevented by Bcb (Bax channel blocker), indicating that Bax can indeed trigger the release of cytochrome c.","Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,Telomerase.   The context mentions that imetelstat acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase.,"Context: imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a  reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths.  Short-term imetelstat treatment also increased γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci staining in  the esophageal cancer cell lines indicating a possible induction of DNA double  strand breaks (DSBs). We also found that pre-treatment with imetelstat led to increased number and size of 53BP1 foci after ionizing radiation. The increase  of 53BP1 foci number was especially pronounced during the first 1h of repair  whereas the increase of foci size was prominent later on.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: The acromelic dysplasia group includes three rare disorders: Weill-Marchesani  syndrome (WMS), Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and Acromicric dysplasia (AD) all  characterized by short stature, short hands and stiff joints. The clinical  overlap between the three disorders is striking. Indeed, in addition to the  diagnostic criteria, they all share common features including delayed bone age,  cone shaped epiphyses, thick skin and heart disease. In contrast, a microspherophakic lens seems to be a characteristic feature of WMS whereas  hepatomegaly and a severe outcome are encountered only in the most severe forms  of GD. Finally, WMS is transmitted either by an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance, GD by an autosomal recessive mode  of inheritance and AD by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Using  genetic approaches, we have identified the molecular basis of WMS and GD which, Context: Severe congenital neutropenia (CN) includes a variety of hematologic disorders  characterized by severe neutropenia, with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) below  0.5 x 10(9)/L, and associated with severe systemic bacterial infections from  early infancy. One subtype of CN, Kostmann syndrome, is an autosomal recessive  disorder, characterized histopathologically by early-stage maturation arrest of  myeloid differentiation. CN with similar clinical features occurs as an  autosomal dominant disorder and many sporadic cases also have been reported.  This genetic heterogeneity suggests that several pathophysiological mechanisms  may lead to this common clinical phenotype. Recent studies on the genetic bases of CN have detected inherited or spontaneous point mutations in the neutrophil  elastase gene (ELA 2) in about 60% to 80% of patients and, less commonly,  mutations in other genes.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. In the context of the first study, it is mentioned that ""Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.""","Context: PURPOSE: We compared the effects of consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  acids (PUFA)-enriched tomato juice versus plain tomato juice on the serum lipid  profile and levels of biomarkers related to antioxidant status and  cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women. METHODS: Eighteen healthy women participated in a 2-week intervention trial  involving the daily intake of 500 mL of n-3 PUFA-enriched juice (n = 11) or plain tomato juice (n = 7). Each serving of enriched juice provided 250 mg of  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Both juices provided  natural antioxidant compounds such as phenolics (181 mg) and lycopene (26.5 mg). RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid  profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL)  remained unchanged. The serum antioxidant status improved following juice, Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.

A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"The indication for isradipine is to slow the rate of progression of renal deterioration.

These L-type channels are likely constrained within a narrow range of biophysical parameters  to perform similar functions in the snail and mammalian cardiovascular systems.  What distinguishes snail and mammalian L-type channels is a difference in dihydropyridine sensitivity: 100 nM isradipine exhibits a significant block of  mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 currents without effect on snail LCa(v)1 currents. The  native snail channel serves as a valuable surrogate for validating key residue, Context: glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow will continue to deteriorate.  Isradipine a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, has been investigated as a  suitable treatment in this setting. Isradipine maintains glomerular filtration  rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers, isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"The VAC regimen includes Vincristine, Actinomycin D (also known as Dactinomycin), and Cyclophosphamide.","Context: Our understanding of Ewing's sarcoma development mediated by the EWS/FLI fusion  protein has been limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the tumor cell of  origin. To circumvent this, we analyzed the function of EWS/FLI in Ewing's  sarcoma itself. By combining retroviral-mediated RNA interference with  reexpression studies, we show that ongoing EWS/FLI expression is required for  the tumorigenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma. We used this system to define the full complement of EWS/FLI-regulated genes in Ewing's sarcoma. Functional  analysis revealed that NKX2.2 is an EWS/FLI-regulated gene that is necessary for  oncogenic transformation in this tumor.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,The most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site is UGUAA.,"Context: The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in  eukaryotes.

The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence.

Treatment with  taraxasterol significantly increased the pain thresholds and reduced the  clinical arthritic scores of the mice in the experimental group compared with  those of the model group. Furthermore, treatment with taraxasterol significantly  suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and nuclear  factor-κB protein expression levels compared with those in the rheumatoid  arthritis model mice. Taraxasterol treatment also significantly reduced nitric  oxide, prostaglandin E2 and cyclooxygenase-2 levels compared with those in the  rheumatoid arthritis model group.

Which part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: some autoimmune diseases. Yaa is a Y-chromosome-linked gene that accelerates  autoimmune diseases in some autoimmune-prone strains of mice. To further  elucidate a possible relationship with autoimmunity, the effect of the Yaa gene  on MAIDS was investigated. Analysis of phenotypic and functional disease  parameters revealed that Yaa does not accelerate MAIDS disease. This is probably  due to the generalized activation of most or all lymphoid cells in MAIDS, which  cannot be enhanced by the Yaa gene. This result is in accordance with the  selective enhancing effect of the Yaa gene on the immune response against self  and foreign antigens in a specific genetic background. It suggests that the autoimmune response associated with MAIDS is a secondary phenomenon.  Interestingly, even in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, autoantibody production may  contribute overproportionally to the hypergammaglobulinemia associated with  MAIDS, Context: intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22) has now been  conclusively shown to confer approximately two-fold risk for seropositive RA as  well as several other autoimmune disorders. PTPN22 appears to act primarily by  setting thresholds for T-cell receptor signaling, and the current data suggest  that the PTPN22 620W allele is likely to be a general risk factor for the  development of humoral autoimmunity. PTPN22 is expressed widely in hematopoietic  cells, but other than in T cells, its role is unknown. These results provide  strong evidence for the longstanding hypothesis that common genes underlie  different autoimmune phenotypes and emphasize that finding genes of only moderate risk can provide important insights into disease pathogenesis","10753498, 15790351",There is a TNFR2 3' flanking region polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"11607787, 11169260, 11196716, 11197692, 10395102"
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Nutrient limitation is an environmental stress that may reduce the effectiveness  of bioremediation strategies, especially when the contaminants are organic  compounds or when organic compounds are added to promote microbial activities  such as metal reduction. Genes indicative of phosphate-limitation were  identified by microarray analysis of chemostat cultures of Geobacter  sulfureducens. This analysis revealed that genes in the pst-pho operon, which is  associated with a high-affinity phosphate uptake system in other microorganisms,  had significantly higher transcript abundance under phosphate-limiting  conditions, with the genes pstB and phoU upregulated the most. Quantitative PCR analysis of pstB and phoU transcript levels in G. sulfurreducens grown in  chemostats demonstrated that the expression of these genes increased when  phosphate was removed from the culture medium. Transcripts of pstB and phoU within the subsurface Geobacter species predominating during an in situ  uranium-bioremediation field experiment were more abundant than in chemostat  cultures of G. sulfurreducens that were not limited for phosphate.

Our study reveals that compound characterization based on three cell lines at  two time points results in more genes being affected than six cell lines at a  single time point. Based on the available LINCS data, we conclude that the most  optimal experimental design to characterize a large set of compounds is to test  them in duplicate in three different cell lines. Our conclusions are constrained  by the fact that the compounds were profiled at a single, relative high  concentration, and the longer time point is likely to result in phenotypic rather than mechanistic effects being recorded","20010635, 27187605",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of  young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Familial Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th  and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3).

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context mentions human homologs to Drosophila insulator binding proteins such as the suppressor of Hairy-wing, but does not mention yeast proteins like Abf1.","Context: gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects. Chromatin  insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic  promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of  surrounding chromatin. The best characterized insulators are from Drosophila. We  hypothesize that the important cellular function of chromatin organization is  evolutionarily conserved and that human homologs to Drosophila insulator binding  proteins such as the suppressor of Hairy-wing exist and can be cloned. Using  these putative proteins, it should be possible to identify corresponding minimal  binding sites with insulator activity. The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors  should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic  transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene  therapy, Context: and epigenetic changes in cHS4 and the transgene promoter. We found that the  core only reduced the clonal variegation in expression. Unique insulator  activity resided in the distal 400 bp cHS4 sequences, which when combined with  the core, restored full insulator activity and open chromatin marks over the  transgene promoter and the insulator. These data consolidate the known  insulating activity of the canonical 5' core with a novel 3' 400 bp element with  properties similar to the core. Together, they have excellent insulating  properties and viral titers.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"In both CHF and AMI patients, plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly elevated compared to controls.","Context:  To investigate relationships between thyroid states and the cardiac endocrine  system, we analyzed thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid hormone, plasma levels of  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in 50 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), in 30 patients with heart failure from acute  myocardial infarction (AMI), and in 15 controls. Plasma levels of IL-6 and BNP  in both CHF and AMI were significantly elevated, while free triiodothyronine (FT3) was significantly decreased compared to controls.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. The results of the present study suggest that hesperidin has neuroprotective potential against QA induced HD like symptoms in rats.,"Context: (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per  se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

Bimagrumab is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab, Context: comorbidity. This drug has been studied in five phase 3 clinical trials, four  discussed herein: semaglutide produces roughly twice as much weight loss as we  have seen in older antiobesity medications. Semaglutide is already in use for  treatment of diabetes and, as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor analog,  is part of a class of drugs used widely in diabetes. Tirzepatide, a  glucose-insulin peptide and GLP-1 dual agonist is in phase 3 study for obesity  management, and bimagrumab is a new agent in phase 2 with a unique mechanism of  action; they are generating much interest.
