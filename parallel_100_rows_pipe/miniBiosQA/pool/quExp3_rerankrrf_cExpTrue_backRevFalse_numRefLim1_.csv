What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"I don't know the answer. The context only mentions implications of histone methylation in general and its relation to oncogenesis, but does not specifically mention medulloblastoma.","Context: which hinder histone methylation and are implicated in oncogenesis, are recently  identified in several cancer disease and called oncohistones. Well-known  oncohistones, with mutations on both H3.1 and H3.3, include H3K36M in  chondroblastoma, H3K27M in glioma, and H3G34 mutations that exist in bone  cancers and gliomas. Oncohistone expression can lead to epigenome/transcriptome  reprogramming and eventually to oncogenesis. The H3K27M, H3G34V/R, and H3K36M  histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.  Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of H3K27M-driven tumorigenesis has recently  led to the identification of some potential therapeutic targets in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this chapter, we will review and summarize recent  studies on the H3K27M-driven tumorigenic mechanisms and properties and the role  of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones in brain tumors",33155136,"Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,I don't know the answer.   (Note: The provided context does not mention specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are regulated by SAM68.),"Context: A significant portion of the mammalian genome encodes numerous transcripts that  are not translated into proteins, termed long non-coding RNAs. Initial studies  identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence  of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the  last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and  function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long  non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it  functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3'  exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have  now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither  bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3'  exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark  of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed  that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be  imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is  marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin",16735596,"HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants modulate fetal hemoglobin via long-range MYB enhancers.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions thyroid hormone receptor beta gene mutations, but does not mention alpha1 mutations.","Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,A highly degenerate sequence.,"Context: hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors",23776204,"Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. An Annexin-V assay was used in the context to reveal that miR-26a but not miR-30b induced apoptosis in HER2-positive BC cells.,"Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: RNA samples were obtained from HER2-positive (SKBR3 and  BT474) and HER2-negetive (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) cells with and without  trastuzumab treatment for 6 days. Next, we conducted a microRNA profiling  analysis using these samples to screen those microRNAs that were up- or  down-regulated only in HER2-positive cells. This analysis identified miR-26a and  miR-30b as trastuzumab-inducible microRNAs. Transfecting miR-26a and miR-30b  induced cell growth suppression in the BC cells by 40% and 32%, respectively. A  cell cycle analysis showed that these microRNAs induced G1 arrest in  HER2-positive BC cells as trastuzumab did. An Annexin-V assay revealed that miR-26a but not miR-30b induced apoptosis in HER2-positive BC cells. Using the  prediction algorithms for microRNA targets, we identified cyclin E2 (CCNE2) as a  target gene of miR-30b.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses is mentioned in the context as a form of integrating gene transfer vectors.,"Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,",21247248,"Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Cytoplasm. The text states that mRNAs are localized to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells.,"Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.,"Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome",22269667,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. The known genetic causes are a microdeletion at 16p13.3 or mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) at 22q13 (5%). Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.","7630403, 16359492, 22269667, 14974086, 18773673, 20684013, 23432975, 22303793, 15706485, 20689175, 22991675"
Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No. The context does not mention any function of Abf1 in acting as an insulator. It only discusses zinc cluster proteins like Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2.","Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida",28379181,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417

Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,Activin type II receptors (ActRII).,"Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab  is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes,  pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29.
