What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,I don't know the answer. The provided context does not mention anything about histone lysine methylation or its implications in medulloblastoma. It only discusses thyroid cancer and pituitary adenomas.,"Context: RET and the intracellular signalling effectors RAS and BRAF- are essential for  the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Similarly, there is  increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the  phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are  essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Besides  this strong relationship between the histological phenotype and the pathway  predominantly activated, the nature of the genetic event seems to determine the  biological behaviour of the tumour and the ultimate clinical outcome of the  patient. In this review we will summarise and discuss the main genetic events related to thyroid cancer initiation, the contribution of genomics and the  convenience of using a new molecular classification of thyroid cancer,  complementary to the clinicopathological classification. This may help us to predict more faithfully the clinical outcome of patients with thyroid cancer and  to select more appropriately candidates for targeted therapies, Context: spinal cord and brain. We report the case of a 15-year-old boy with the  diagnosis of aggressive GH-PRL pituitary macroadenoma and a family history of  VHL disease. Pituitary resection was performed, although complete excision of  the lesion could not be confirmed by the neurosurgeon. A control MRI was done  6 months after surgery and the pituitary lesion was similar to the presurgical  image. A second operation allowed partial resection of the tumour followed by  targeted radiotherapy. Pituitary adenomas are rare benign tumours in children  with macroadenomas observed mainly in boys. These tumours in adolescents often  occur in a familial setting or in the context of known genetic defects. Angiogenesis is an important feature of pituitary adenomas and a possible  inhibitory role of pVHL in pituitary angiogenesis has been suggested. This  GH-PRL pituitary macroadenoma with a VHL mutation might be of particular aggressiveness. Pituitary adenomas are not classically described in VHL syndrome  and the medical community should be alerted to its rare occurrence in this  location","18055323, 22265326","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,The SET7/9 histone methyltransferase deposits a monomethyl mark on lysine 4 of histone H3.,"Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells, Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from  the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate  that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule  inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies","23302691, 21940714",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context states that Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c.","Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,The IL-17 receptor.,"Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,"Symplekin, alpha-Kaps (alpha1 and alpha2), beta-Kaps.","Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.

These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.

Mol, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,","16717285, 21247248","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. They mostly arise by point mutations in known protein-coding genes.,"Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific.

Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?,"The R package copynumber has been developed for copy number analysis. Additionally, crlmm is also mentioned as an implementation of a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number.","Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at  different times or by different labs.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Cytoplasm. Stress granules are formed in response to various stressors and are composed of proteins that are involved in translation initiation and other processes, and they are localized in the cytoplasm.","Context:  Protein aggregation is a continuous process in our cells. Some proteins  aggregate in a regulated manner required for different vital functional  processes in the cells whereas other protein aggregates result from misfolding caused by various stressors. The decision to form an aggregate is largely made  by chaperones and chaperone-assisted proteins. Proteins that are damaged beyond  repair are degraded either by the proteasome or by the lysosome via autophagy. The aggregates can be degraded by the proteasome and by chaperone-mediated  autophagy only after dissolution into soluble single peptide species. Hence,  protein aggregates as such are degraded by macroautophagy. The selective, Context:  BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is known to exist in  five different isoforms. PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the  nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus, PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively  studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly  defined.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context states that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context:  Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously, Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells","12200417, 27262581",Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417
What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The context does not provide specific information about the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. It may be a candidate agent for neuroprotective treatment in the retina.,"Context:  We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress. We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-α gene  expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological  function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured, Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP.
