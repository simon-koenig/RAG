What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it may play a role in tumorigenesis, as high levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) were observed in","Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation, Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,","14688019, 14688019, 19747111, 23179372","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. These lncRNAs were identified as being regulated by Sam68 in the context of adipogenesis.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the, Context: Our previous study found that the nuclear protein, 68-kDa Src-associated in  mitosis protein (Sam68), is translocated to the cytoplasm and forms punctate  pattern during enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection [Virus Research, 180 (2014),  1-11]. However, the exact function of this punctate pattern in cytoplasm during  EV71 infection remains unknown. In this study, we firstly have examined this  punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the  obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs). Sam68,  belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then  confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless, Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly,  indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71  infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs  formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a  microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that, Context: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) include a series of malignant tumors arising in  epithelial tissues, typically oral cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer  and thyroid cancer. HNCs are important contributors to cancer incidence and  mortality, leading to approximately 225,100 new patients and 77,500 deaths in  China every year. Determination of the mechanisms of HNC carcinogenesis and  progression is an urgent priority in HNC treatment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNAs longer than 200 bps. lncRNAs have been reported to  participate in a broad scope of biological processes, and lncRNA dysregulation  leads to diverse human diseases, including cancer. In this review, we focus on lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HNCs, summarize the latest findings regarding  the function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in HNC carcinogenesis and  progression, and discuss the clinical application of lncRNAs in HNC diagnosis,, Context:  Long noncoding RNAs have recently been discovered to comprise a sizeable  fraction of the RNA World. The scope of their functions, physical organization,  and disease relevance remain in the early stages of characterization. Although many thousands of lncRNA transcripts recently have been found to emanate from  the expansive DNA between protein-coding genes in animals, there are also  hundreds that have been found in simple eukaryotes. Furthermore, lncRNAs have been found in the bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life,  suggesting they are ubiquitous. In this chapter, we focus primarily on what has  been learned so far about lncRNAs from the greatly studied single-celled","29137239, 27057671, 27802187, 28815538","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
Describe RIblast,RIblast is a computational tool for predicting RNA secondary structures. It uses a seed-and-extension approach with suffix arrays and an RNA secondary structure energy model to achieve high prediction accuracy at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.,"Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, pure red blood cell aplasia of  childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors. About 40% of  patients display various malformations. Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment  in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell  transplantation. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19,  are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than  25% of cases. Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of  patients show that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis.  Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of  patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding  sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia who were negative for  RPS19 mutations. RESULTS: About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and  only 1.6% in RPS24. All but three mutations that we report here are new, Context: Diamond Blackfan anemia is characterized by a severe hypoplastic anemia and a  heterogeneous collection of other clinical features. Approximately 25% of  Diamond Blackfan anemia cases are associated with mutations in the gene encoding  ribosomal protein S19. The hypothesis presented here ties together molecular and  clinical features of the disease, and establishes a conceptual framework for  understanding many of the unusual characteristics of a growing number of diseases linked to factors involved in ribosome synthesis. The hypothesis states  that ribosomal proteins are expressed in amounts that differ relative to one  another in a tissue-specific manner, and that haploinsufficiency for a particular protein may make that protein limiting for ribosome assembly in some  tissues, while other tissues remain unaffected. Further, polymorphisms in  factors controlling the expression of a particular ribosomal protein gene may, Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This is achieved through fluorescence in situ hybrid","Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This unit details how Oligopaint probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: A host of observations demonstrating the relationship between nuclear  architecture and processes such as gene expression have led to a number of new  technologies for interrogating chromosome positioning. Whereas some of these  technologies reconstruct intermolecular interactions, others have enhanced our  ability to visualize chromosomes in situ. Here, we describe an oligonucleotide-  and PCR-based strategy for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform that enables this technology to be extended to any  organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are  renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers  precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and  multicolor imaging of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with, Context: This work is concerned with more complex geometric properties, i.e., the  complete shape formed by genomic regions. Our work is based on statistical shape  theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures,  e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution,  and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions. We found that geometric normalization  with respect to the nucleus shape based on non-rigid image registration has a","26868282, 24510436, 23236188, 18789978","Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: DNA and histone modifications direct the functional state of chromatin and  thereby the readout of the genome. Candidate approaches and histone peptide  affinity purification experiments have identified several proteins that bind to  chromatin marks. However, the complement of factors that is recruited by  individual and combinations of DNA and histone modifications has not yet been  defined. Here, we present a strategy based on recombinant, uniformly modified chromatin templates used in affinity purification experiments in conjunction  with SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry for this purpose. On the  prototypic H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 histone modification marks we compare our method with a histone N-terminal peptide affinity purification approach. Our analysis  shows that only some factors associate with both, chromatin and peptide matrices  but that a surprisingly large number of proteins differ in their association, Context: Post-translational modifications of histone proteins, the basic building blocks  around which eukaryotic DNA is organized, are crucially involved in the  regulation of genome activity as they control chromatin structure and dynamics.  The recruitment of specific binding proteins that recognize and interact with  particular histone modifications is thought to constitute a fundamental  mechanism by which histone marks mediate biological function. For instance, tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is important for recruiting  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby  regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging, and heterochromatin formation. Until now, little was known about the regulation of effector-histone mark  interactions, and in particular, of the binding of HP1 to H3K9me3. Recently, we  and others presented evidence that a ""binary methylation-phosphorylation switch"", Context:  Defining the protein factors that directly recognize post-translational,  covalent histone modifications is essential toward understanding the impact of  these chromatin ""marks"" on gene regulation. In the current study, we identify human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that  directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4. In vitro  binding studies identified that CHD1 recognizes di- and trimethyl H3K4 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 5 microm, whereas monomethyl H3K4  binds CHD1 with a 3-fold lower affinity. Surprisingly, human CHD1 binds to  methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. In, Context:  Post-translational modification of histone tails is thought to modulate  higher-order chromatin structure. Combinations of modifications including  acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation have been proposed to provide marks recognized by specific proteins. This is exemplified, in both mammalian cells  and fission yeast, by transcriptionally silent constitutive pericentric  heterochromatin. Such heterochromatin contains histones that are generally hypoacetylated and methylated by Suv39h methyltransferases at lysine 9 of  histone H3 (H3-K9). Each of these modification states has been implicated in the  maintenance of HP1 protein-binding at pericentric heterochromatin, in","21836164, 17172865, 16263726, 11850619",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

To explore which receptors involved the effects of PGI2 analogs on the expression of MIP-1α expression, I  prostanoid (IP) and E prostanoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-r receptor antagonists were used to pretreat THP-1 cells. Forskolin, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activator, was also used to  further confirm the cAMP involvement on the effect of PGI2 analogs in MIP-1α  production. RESULTS: Three PGI2 analogs could suppress LPS-induced MIP-1α production in, Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female, Context: majority of cells. Consequently, although all cells displayed linear I-V  relations in Mg(2+)-free saline, cells in which the slow EPSC was predominently  mediated by NMDA receptors exhibited voltage-dependent rectification in the  presence of external Mg2+ (1 mM). 6. With increasing postnatal age (10-30 d),  the contribution made to the slow EPSC by NMDA receptors declined, with a  reciprocal increase in the contribution being made by AMPA/KA  receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","3537733, 24402297, 30276444, 7472327",Her-2 belongs to the family of the human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs).,"16707458, 26545934, 15173008, 27993109, 30312728, 15920544, 21896992, 33202212, 11785652, 17536308, 15782071, 11694782, 22505536, 17867585, 12767812, 25620423, 27426127, 30384340, 10480346, 11180765, 19048033, 7612897, 21805036, 19279475, 29389942, 16800251, 18505086"

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context mentions that CsA (cyclosporin A) totally prevented cytochrome c release when apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells, indicating that Bax can indeed trigger","Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis, Context:  BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. However, it  remains unclear by what mechanism BAX is triggered to initiate apoptosis. Here,  we reveal the mechanism using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. An inactive BAX monomer was found to exhibit conformational heterogeneity and exist  at equilibrium in two conformations, one of which has never been reported. We  show that upon apoptotic stimulus by BH3-only peptides, BAX can be induced to convert into either a ligand-bound monomer or an oligomer through a  conformational selection mechanism. The kinetics of reaction is studied by means  of time-resolved ESR, allowing a direct in situ observation for the, Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: Cell death plays an important role in a number of physiological processes in all  complex multicellular organisms. One of the molecules that regulates this  process is BAX, an integral membrane protein, that promotes apoptosis. The  function of BAX is countered by BCL-2 and BCL-XL. The differential expression of  these proteins can influence the ability of the cell to die or survive.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Upregulated.  In many of the provided contexts, MALAT-1 is mentioned as being up-regulated in various types of cancers.","Context: PURPOSE: To understand the role of MALAT-1 in prostate cancer we evaluated its  expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. We also studied the  therapeutic effects of MALAT-1 silencing on castration resistant prostate cancer  cells in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction was used to detect MALAT-1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. siRNA against MALAT-1 was designed and the silencing effect was  examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The  biological effects of MALAT-1 siRNA on cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation using a cell counting kit and cell colony assays as well as cell  migration by in vitro scratch assay, cell invasion by Transwell® invasion assay  and cell cycle by flow cytometry. We further investigated the effect of, Context: increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth,  movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that MALAT-1 expression levels are associated  with patient survival and identify tumor-promoting functions of MALAT-1, Context: small interfering RNA or negative control small interfering RNA. The cell  proliferation changes of the transfected bladder urothelial carcinoma cells were  determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis caused by silencing MALAT1 was  evaluated using the flow cytometry assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The motility changes induced by silencing MALAT1 were measured using the wound  healing assay. RESULTS: MALAT1 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma compared with  matched normal urothelium (P=.008). The MALAT1 expression levels were greater in  high-grade carcinomas than in low-grade carcinoma (P=.001). The MALAT1  expression levels were greater in invasive carcinoma than in noninvasive carcinoma (P=.018). Cell proliferation inhibition, increased apoptosis, and  decreased motility were observed in MALAT1 small interfering RNA-transfected  bladder urothelial carcinoma T24 and 5637 cells. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 plays an oncogenic role in urothelial carcinoma of the  bladder. Silencing MALAT1 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for this  cancer, Context: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a long  non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and associated  with cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the","23845456, 22088988, 23153939, 21678027",Malat-1 expression is upregulated in several tumor types,"21266177, 16878148, 24163781, 22722759, 21678027, 16441420, 18006640, 23845456, 20007090, 22858678, 23726266, 15552795, 22088988, 12970751"

Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3.

Together, these results suggest that NTS and MSM may  be potential drug candidates for anti-inflammation therapy, Context: INTRODUCTION: NF-kB is a key regulator of inflammation and immunity in cancer  development. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic  subunits termed IKK-α, -β and -γ. It is well known that many pro-inflammatory  stimuli require the IKK-β subunit for NF-kB activation. AREAS COVERED: NF-kB affects the progression of inflammation-related  diseases,such as myocardial ischemia, bronchial asthma, arthritis, cancer and  other diseases. We review the characteristics and effects of these inhibitors on  inflammatory and other diseases. EXPERT OPINION: Various synthesized IKK inhibitors have been developed and they  will be used clinically in the near future, Context: patients with atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Available systemic drugs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  are limited. There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen.  Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment  of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2)  allergic inflammation are promising. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody  to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published  efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. A number  of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in  atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin).  Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval  of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,Telomerase. It binds with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic activity.,"Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context: but has only limited expression in normal tissues. Thus, inhibition of  telomerase has been shown to be a viable approach in controlling cancer growth  in nonclinical studies and is currently in phase II clinical trials. In this  study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase  inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and  pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase  activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Additionally, imetelstat treatment reduced the CSC fractions present in the  breast and pancreatic cell lines. In vitro treatment with imetelstat, but not control oligonucleotides, also reduced the proliferation and self-renewal  potential of MCF7 mammospheres and resulted in cell death after <4 weeks of  treatment. In vitro treatment of PANC1 cells showed reduced tumor engraftment in nude mice, concomitant with a reduction in the CSC levels. Differences between  telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor  cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of, Context: Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells.

Intrahepatic cholestasis,"Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome.

Although similar to the  other craniosynostosis syndromes in its clinical presentation, this syndrome is  caused by a mutation in the TWIST1 gene. The TWIST1 gene product is a  transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain important  in the development of the head and limbs. Clinical features of this syndrome include unilateral or bilateral coronal synostosis, ptosis, low-set ears,  hearing loss, hypertelorism, maxillary hypoplasia, deviated nasal septum, broad  great toes, clinodactyly, and syndactyly.

Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established.

In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy).

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,Yes. Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % with the high tomato diet in a study of twenty-one healthy subjects.,"Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context:  High dietary intakes of tomato products are often associated with a reduced risk  of CVD, but the atheroprotective mechanisms have not been established. This  study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary intake of tomato products on plasma lipids and LDL oxidation. The diet intervention  included a baseline period, a 3-week low tomato diet (no tomato products  allowed) and a 3-week high tomato diet (400 ml tomato juice and 30 mg tomato ketchup daily). Twenty-one healthy study subjects participated in the study.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension and stroke prevention. Isradipine reduces infarct size caused by embolic stroke in rats.,"Context: The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion  of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood, Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension,  resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and  augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is inhibited by LB-100.,"Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the, Context: Various genes have been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of  follicular thyroid tumors. Cowden syndrome is the only known familial syndrome  with an increased risk of both follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and carcinoma  (FTC). Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a  dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with  Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular  thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in PTEN, which maps to  10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of  markers within 10q22-24 occurs in about 25%. Recently, another phosphatase gene, MINPP1, has been localized to 10q23.3. MINPP1 has the ability to remove  3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates, a function that overlaps that of  PTEN. Because of this overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, we  considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could contribute to the  pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. We analyzed DNA from tumor and, Context: Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas (AAM) represent 20% of all meningiomas. They  are associated with poor outcomes due to their tendency to recur.

CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with  a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most  dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians' experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN's image classification. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: This study was registered at the German Clinical Trial  Register (DRKS-Study-ID: DRKS00013570; https://www.drks.de/drks_web/), Context: Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following  reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of  pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two  fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously  produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result.

Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: A randomized study of 264 children and adults with previously untreated  localized Ewing's sarcoma of bone was undertaken between 1973 and 1978 by 83  institutions of three national study groups: Children's Cancer Study Group,  Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The Intergroup Study  was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral  pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide  (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and  metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival  rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of  disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC  plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to treatment with VAC alone.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,A highly degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A residues after the cleavage point.,"Context: signal peptide regions and short regions (<50 consecutive residues) unlikely to  harbour new families, for ∼38% of the human protein residues, there was no  information in Pfam about conservation and evolutionary relationship with other  protein regions. This uncovered portion of the human proteome was found to be  distributed over almost 25 000 distinct protein regions. Comparison with  proteins in the UniProtKB database suggested that the human regions that  exhibited similarity to thousands of other sequences were often either divergent  elements or N- or C-terminal extensions of existing families. Thirty-four per  cent of regions, on the other hand, matched fewer than 100 sequences in UniProtKB. Most of these did not appear to share any relationship with existing  Pfam-A families, suggesting that thousands of new families would need to be  generated to cover them. Also, these latter regions were particularly rich in amino acid compositional bias such as the one associated with intrinsic  disorder. This could represent a significant obstacle toward their inclusion  into new Pfam families. Based on these observations, a major focus for, Context: distributions (linearity in log-log scale) in the spatial arrangement of Alu and  LINE1 elements in the human genome. Here we investigate the large-scale features  of the spatial arrangement of all principal classes of TEs in 14 genomes from  phylogenetically distant organisms by studying the size distribution of  inter-repeat distances. Power-law-like size distributions are found to be  widespread, extending up to several orders of magnitude. In order to understand  the emergence of this distributional pattern, we introduce an evolutionary  scenario, which includes (i) Insertions of DNA segments (e.g., more recent  repeats) into the considered sequence and (ii) Eliminations of members of the studied TE family. In the proposed model we also incorporate the potential for  transposition events (characteristic of the DNA transposons' life-cycle) and  segmental duplications. Simulations reproduce the main features of the observed size distributions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various genomic  features on the presence and extent of power-law size distributions including TE  class and age, mode of parental TE transmission, GC content, deletion and, Context: hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors, Context: proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site.  We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine 36  tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage  sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a  single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the H3K36Me3 levels are comparable  among the alternative polyadenylation sites themselves.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. It binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells.,"Context:  Apoptotic cells possess specific morphological and biochemical markers. Various  methods have been developed to detect apoptosis based on these markers. One of  the most common is the fragmentation of genomic DNA. In addition to electrophoresis for the identification of the characteristic 200 base pair  ladders and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick  end-labeling, DNA content analysis is often employed. This technique is based on the fact that permeablized apoptotic cells release fragmented DNA, resulting in  DNA content that is less than that in live diploid cells. Although widely used,  we have found that the number of apoptotic cells detected by DNA content, Context:  Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells.

Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold.

Apoptosis is characterized based on morphological and biochemical criteria. Morphological characteristics include cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic  condensation, chromatin segregation and condensation, membrane blebbing, and the  formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, whereas the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA cleavage into oligonucleosome-length  fragments. A great deal of research is aimed at defining the molecular  mechanisms that play a role in apoptosis. As one of the common end points of, Context:  The ability of a cell to undergo apoptosis is crucial during development, tissue  homeostasis, and in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease (1). To study  apoptosis, it is important to be able to detect apoptotic cells reliably.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and that defects in DNA repair genes contribute to tumorigenesis, specifically mentioning homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes such as BRCA2, BRCA1,","Context:  Genomic instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The incidence of genetic  alterations in homologous recombination repair genes increases during cancer  progression, and 20% of prostate cancers (PCas) have defects in DNA repair genes. Several somatic and germline gene alterations drive prostate cancer  tumorigenesis, and the most important of these are BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM and CHEK2.  There is a group of BRCAness tumours that share phenotypic and genotypic properties with classical BRCA-mutated tumours. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase  inhibitors (PARPis) show synthetic lethality in cancer cells with impaired  homologous recombination genes, and patients with these alterations are, Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: Brca1 deficiency leads to the development of breast cancer. We previously found  that Brca1 deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway. Reduced expression of  Brca1 was highly correlated with increased activated Akt in human breast cancer  samples. Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in  Brca1-deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. Defective homologous  recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to tumorigenesis in Brca1 deficiency. Here, we show that Akt1 promotes chromosome instability in  Brca1-deficent cells. DNA breaks in Brca1-deficent cells are aberrantly joined  into complex chromosome rearrangements by a process dependent on Akt1. Depletion of Akt1 increases HR in Brca1-mutant cells, which is rescued by expression of  wild-type, but not mutant Akt1 with deletion of Brca1-binding domain.

The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts.

RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate  that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD, Context: The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)  inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor,  3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase  (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. In vitro, carbidopa,  benserazide and NSD-1015 all potently inhibited hepatic MAO A and B activity  (IC(50) 10-50 micro M). In ex vivo studies following systemic drug administration, NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg ip) produced 88% and 96% inhibition of  hepatic and striatal MAO A and B activity respectively. Carbidopa (12.5 mg/kg  i.p.) and benserazide (50 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on striatal MAO A activity or hepatic MAO B activity. However, they inhibited striatal MAO B activity by 45  +/- 10% and 36 +/- 10% respectively.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes. The context mentions ""The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and vector-mediated genotoxicity.""","Context: particular B30.2 domain variable elements. These results suggest that  occasional, complex changes were incorporated into the TRIM5alpha B30.2 domain  at discrete time points during the evolution of primates. Some of these time  points correspond to periods during which primates were exposed to retroviral  infections, based on the appearance of particular endogenous retroviruses in  primate genomes. The results are consistent with a role for TRIM5alpha in innate  immunity against retroviruses, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase  cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the mouse  enzyme was found to be transferred to human cells at high efficiency. Enzyme, Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR)","15857996, 21247248, 10757351, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes. These antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity because they are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already expressed in normal cells, implying that they originate from known protein-coding genes.","Context: The immunohistological distribution of blood group (BG)-related antigens  including A, B, H type 2, and sialylated Lex in lung adenocarcinomas was  examined using monoclonal antibodies. BG-A, B, and H type 2 compatible with the  ABO status in tumor cells were expressed in 60% of the cases. Accumulation of H  type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of  patients with BG status other than 0. Tumor-associated antigens, Lex and sialylated Lex were detected in 36.0% and 72.0%, respectively. Modification of  carbohydrate antigens in cancer may be associated with incomplete synthesis;  accumulation of precursor antigen; and activated sialylation, Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses.

In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?,copynumber. It is a software suite for segmentation of copy number variations in the human genome.,"Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: negative. Whole exome sequencing was therefore applied to capture the majority  of protein-coding regions for the identification of single-nucleotide variants,  small insertion/deletions, and copy number abnormalities in the patient's  germline as well as primary tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the patient's blood, primary  tumor, and the unaffected mother's blood. DNA libraries were constructed and  sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000. Data were post-processed using Picard and  Samtools, then analyzed with the Genome Analysis Toolkit. Variants were  annotated using an in-house Ensembl-based program. Copy number was assessed  using ExomeCNV. RESULTS: Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than  120×. A rare non-synonymous coding single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in TP53 was  identified in the germline. There were 10 somatic cancer protein-damaging variants that were not observed in the unaffected mother genome.

Although whole-genome  sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability.  To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to  control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our  predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we  find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to, Context:  SUMMARY: Copy number variation (CNV) is a major type of structural genomic  variation that is increasingly studied across different species for association  with diseases and production traits.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T  cells are widely studied for cancer immunotherapy. CD19-specific CAR-T cells,  tisagenlecleucel, have been recently approved for clinical application. Ongoing  clinical trials are testing CAR designs directed at novel targets involved in  hematological and solid malignancies. In addition to trials of single-target  CAR-T cells, simultaneous and sequential CAR-T cells are being studied for  clinical applications. Multi-target CAR-engineered T cells are also entering  clinical trials. T cell receptor-engineered CAR-T and universal CAR-T cells represent new frontiers in CAR-T cell development. In this study, we analyzed  the characteristics of CAR constructs and registered clinical trials of CAR-T  cells in China and provided a quick glimpse of the landscape of CAR-T studies in  China, Context: diseases (i.e. different types of hematologic malignancies, solid tumors) as  well as in various infections (i.e. pneumonia, tuberculosis, HIV infection etc.)  and related inflammatory conditions is not well understood. As the immune system  plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both infection-related as well as  noninfectious (i.e. cancer) inflammatory diseases, much research has been done  in the past few years to discover and design better immunomodulatory agents.

Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show  that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly  limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: A model to quantitatively characterize the effect of evinacumab, an  investigational monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3  (ANGPTL3) on lipid trafficking is needed. A quantitative systems pharmacology  (QSP) approach was developed to predict the transient responses of different  triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles in response to evinacumab  administration. A previously published hepatic lipid model was modified to  address specific queries relevant to the mechanism of evinacumab and its effect  on lipid metabolism. Modifications included the addition of intermediate-density  lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein compartments to address the modulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by evinacumab, ANGPTL3 biosynthesis and  clearance, and a target-mediated drug disposition model. A sensitivity analysis  guided the creation of virtual patients (VPs). The drug-free QSP model was found to agree well with clinical data published with the initial hepatic liver model  over simulations ranging from 20 to 365 days in duration. The QSP model,  including the interaction between LPL and ANGPTL3, was validated against, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1.","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes","12032775, 28161276, 21632975, 16888367","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome characterized by  facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes, and growth and mental  retardation as the main clinical features. RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross  chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations. Translocations and inversions  involving chromosome band 16p13.3 form the minority of CBP mutations, whereas microdeletions occur more frequently (about 10%). Most deletion studies in RTS  are performed by FISH analysis, and five cosmids must be used to cover the whole  of the CBP gene, which spreads over 150 kb.

Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three  females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces.

Regarding this, much  attention has been paid to natural antioxidants as a novel prevention and  treatment strategy for cancer. Flavonoids are one of the most important  ingredients in vegetables and fruits, especially in the genus Citrus. Hesperidin is a flavonone glycoside, belonging to the flavonoid family, which is widely  found in Citrus species and acts as a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent.

Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural  flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury  and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its  neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse  model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the  antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bimagrumab on skeletal muscle mass and  function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and  reduced skeletal muscle mass. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with COPD (mean FEV1, 1.05 L [41.6% predicted];  aged 40-80 yr; body mass index < 20 kg/m2 or appendicular skeletal muscle mass  index ≤ 7.25 [men] and ≤ 5.67 [women] kg/m2), received two doses of either, Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab  is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes,  pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal functions were evaluated with basal hormone measurement and  standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests at baseline, Week 8 and at the end of study (EOS)-Week  20. RESULTS: At Week 8, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were reduced by  42.16 IU/L (P < .001) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased by 2.5, Context: comorbidity. This drug has been studied in five phase 3 clinical trials, four  discussed herein: semaglutide produces roughly twice as much weight loss as we  have seen in older antiobesity medications. Semaglutide is already in use for  treatment of diabetes and, as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor analog,  is part of a class of drugs used widely in diabetes.

Further, these developments  shall be used to launch a speculation of what is likely to be their impact on  the future of obesity pharmacotherapy, Context: The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is used to treat multiple myeloma (MM).  Bortezomib inhibits protein degradation by inactivating proteasomes'  active-sites. MM cells are exquisitely sensitive to Bortezomib - exhibiting a  low-nanomolar IC(50) - suggesting that minimal inhibition of degradation  suffices to kill MM cells. Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration,  contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM  cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small  proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that  Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity. Comparing MM  cells to other, Bortezomib-resistant, cancer cells shows that the degree of  proteasome inhibition is the greatest in MM cells and only there leads to proteasome stress, providing an explanation for why Bortezomib is effective  against MM but not other cancers","30095981, 29566437, 34518444, 26288836",Bimagrumab blocks the activin type II receptors.,30095981

We identified 9  novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included, Context:  We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously, Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding  disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome,, Context: The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding  disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets.

Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes. Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a spinal epidural hematoma in one of the cases mentioned.,"Context:  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case demonstrates  that patients are sometimes reluctant to disclose folk medical treatments to Western physicians, and the proper diagnosis may depend upon the prowess of the  neuroradiologist, Context:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acupotomy is a modern type of acupuncture that uses a  blade-needle combined with a flat surgical scalpel at its tip. This study was  conducted to summarize and critically evaluate the current evidence on  acupotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All relevant studies up to February 19, 2019, were  included, through comprehensive searches in 11 electronic databases without  language restrictions. RESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews (SRs) comprising of 69 randomized controlled trials were included, and the methodological quality was medium-to-high in  AMSTAR. All the included studies reviewed musculoskeletal disorders and reported  a significantly higher total effective and cure rates in the acupotomy group for, Context: BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Subdural spinal hematoma (SDH) is a very rare entity;  however, it can lead to serious complications resulting from injuries to the  spinal cord and roots. Although acupuncture has been a popular method for the  management of pain control, we encountered the first case of SDH after  acupuncture. PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to present the first case of  subdural hematoma after acupuncture and the reasons for the risks of blind cervical acupuncture. STUDY DESIGN: A case report and review of the previous literature are presented. METHODS: A 69-year-old man complained of progressive weakness in the right upper and lower extremities 2 hours after acupuncture on the cervical spine and back.  The diagnosis was delayed because of unilateral weakness, and the symptom was  initially misinterpreted as a transient ischemic attack because of no sensory, Context:  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Subdural spinal hematoma (SDH) is a very rare entity;  however, it can lead to serious complications resulting from injuries to the  spinal cord and roots.

"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes.  The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep, with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations.","Context: mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders.
