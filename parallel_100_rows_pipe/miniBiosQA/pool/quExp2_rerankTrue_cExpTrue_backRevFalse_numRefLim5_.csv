What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"No, the context does not provide information about the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma. The context discusses various aspects and functions of histone lysine methylation but does not mention or","Context:  Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active  chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified.  Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. KDM4A  demethylates H3K36me3, a modification enriched in the 3' end of active genes.  The genomic targets and the role of KDM4 proteins in development remain largely unknown. We therefore generated KDM4A mutant Drosophila, and identified 99  mis-regulated genes in first instar larvae. Around half of these genes were  down-regulated and the other half up-regulated in dKDM4A mutants. Although, Context:  The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic, Context:  Methylation of position-specific lysine residues in histone N termini is a  central modification for regulating epigenetic transitions in chromatin. Each  methylatable lysine residue can exist in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated state, thereby extending the indexing potential of this particular modification. Here,  we examine all possible methylation states for histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) and  lysine 27 (H3-K27) in mammalian chromatin. Using highly specific antibodies together with quantitative mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that pericentric  heterochromatin is selectively enriched for H3-K27 monomethylation and H3-K9  trimethylation. This heterochromatic methylation profile is dependent on the, Context:  Methylation of histone lysine residues in eukaryotic chromatin has been an  exciting area of research ever since the first histone methyltransferase enzyme,  Suv39h, was found to methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 in 2000. Only a year later, the HP1 chromodomain polypeptide was identified as a recognition module  for this histone modification. Similar to bromodomain-containing proteins that  recognize histone acetylation sites and subsequently stabilize large complexes to chromatin, effector proteins can also be recruited and stabilized by histone  methylation. Although histone acetylation generally correlates with active  transcription, histone methylation is associated with both the activation and, Context:  Recently developed biochemical techniques have enabled researchers to study  histone modifications more easily and accurately. One of these modifications,  histone lysine methylation, has been shown to be highly stable and to represent an epigenetic alteration. Extensive biochemical analyses have led to discoveries  about the nature and functions of this modification, thus accelerating our  understanding of this crucial epigenetic event. Here we describe basic methods for purification and biochemical analysis of lysine-directed, histone  methyltransferases from HeLa cell-derived extracts.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs interact with both transposon","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world, Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage, Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.

Thus, by reanimating, Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on what the minimal genome build is. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed in the context, but no specific details about its build are provided.","Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced, Context:  A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits monomethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1) and monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H","Context: Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation  patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the  activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). Here, we show that  SET7, a known histone methyltransferase, is involved in the regulation of  protein stability of DNMT1. SET7 colocalizes and directly interacts with DNMT1  and specifically monomethylates Lys-142 of DNMT1. Methylated DNMT1 peaks during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle and is prone to proteasome-mediated  degradation. Overexpression of SET7 leads to decreased DNMT1 levels, and  siRNA-mediated knockdown of SET7 stabilizes DNMT1. These results demonstrate that signaling through SET7 represents a means of DNMT1 enzyme turnover, Context: methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs). Several HMTs and HDMs have  been implicated in cancer, inflammation, and diabetes, making them attractive  targets for drug therapy. Hence, the discovery of small-molecule modulators for  these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate  that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale.

Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted  survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to  determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS: This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with  MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009  were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected, Context: 36 operations (three patients underwent surgical treatment twice) from February  2006 to December 2013. The median age of the patients was 56 years old (range,  28 to 71; male : female=30 : 3).  RESULTS: Overall survival was not correlated with age, sex, level of metastases,  preoperative Child-Pugh classification, preoperative ambulatory function,  preoperative radiotherapy, type of operation, administration of Sorafenib, or  the Tokuhashi scoring system. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an  independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Comparing the Child-Pugh  classification and ambulatory ability, there were no statistically differences between patients pre- and post-operatively.

Although there  are scales that attempt to manage these patients, their real applicability is  unknown. The Tokuhashi Scoring System (TSS) is a widely used prognostic tool. At the time of treatment, the data necessary to complete TSS may be incomplete,  making its application impossible. Objective To evaluate the number of TSS  scores completed by the time the clinical therapeutic decision was made. Methods From July 2010 to January 2012, we selected patients who were diagnosed with  spinal metastases. Results Sixty spinal metastasis patients (21 female, 39 male)  were evaluated between July 2010 and January 2012. At the time of the treatment, Context: calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score  and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38,  respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system  overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system  underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8.

Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors, Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners.

It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin  (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes.  HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Conversely,  reducing HN expression by small interfering RNAs sensitizes cells to Bax and  increases Bax translocation to membranes. HN peptides also block Bax association  with isolated mitochondria, and suppress cytochrome c release in vitro. Notably,  the mitochondrial genome contains an identical open reading frame, and the  mitochondrial version of HN can also bind and suppress Bax. We speculate therefore that HN arose from mitochondria and transferred to the nuclear genome,  providing a mechanism for protecting these organelles from Bax, Context: Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an apoptosis-inducing protein that  participates in cell death during normal development and in various diseases.  Bax resides in an inactive state in the cytosol of many cells. In response to  death stimuli, Bax protein undergoes conformational changes that expose  membrane-targeting domains, resulting in its translocation to mitochondrial  membranes, where Bax inserts and causes release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. It is unknown what controls conversion of Bax from the  inactive to active conformation. Here we show that Bax interacts with humanin  (HN), an anti-apoptotic peptide of 24 amino acids encoded in mammalian genomes. HN prevents the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not implicated in resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. RTH is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta","Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

Extreme  prematurity (26-28 weeks) was an independent risk factor for composite perinatal  adverse outcomes [odds ratio (OR) 43.9; p = 0.001]. Extreme prematurity (OR  42.9; p = 0.001), PPROM (OR 7.1; p = 0.01), male infant (OR 5.2; p = 0.02) and  intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR, OR 4.8; p = 0.04) were factors for  composite respiratory adverse outcomes.  CONCLUSION: Preterm premature rupture of membranes before viability represents  an independent risk factor for composite respiratory adverse outcomes in preterm  neonates. Extreme prematurity may represent the main risk factor for both composite respiratory and perinatal adverse outcomes, Context: consequent deformation of the skull. Here, a case report is presented of a  Caucasian male child affected by craniostenosis of the sagittal suture with a  orthodontic-orthopedic diagnosed ogival palate and insufficient space for the  eruption of the superior canines. The patient was treated by fitting a rapid  palatal protractor, an orthopedic device that acts upon the median palatine  suture of the palate increasing the transverse diameter of the upper jaw and  causes the widening and lowering of the floor of the nasal cavity. The results  obtained were equivalent to those obtained in subjects with no past medical  history of craniosynostosis. This clinical study demonstrated that the premature fusion of the mid-sagittal suture of the skull, that characterises sagittal  craniosynostoses, can occur without the involvement of the median suture of the  palate, rendering expansion possible by means of orthopedic treatment, Context: caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell  morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase  activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of  caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent  phenotype. Subcytotoxic oxidative stress is known to induce premature senescence  in diploid fibroblasts. Interestingly, we show that subcytotoxic level of  hydrogen peroxide induces premature senescence in NIH 3T3 cells and increases  endogenous caveolin-1 expression. Importantly, quercetin and vitamin E, two  antioxidant agents, successfully prevent the premature senescent phenotype and the up-regulation of caveolin-1 induced by hydrogen peroxide. Also, we  demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide alone, but not in combination with quercetin,  stimulates the caveolin-1 promoter activity. Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring  antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is  recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored. Taken together, these results, Context: healthy donors, and from young patients with inherited defects leading to  premature aging, we demonstrated that p16(INK4a) is a reliable marker of both  physiological and premature epidermal aging. Analysis of the expression and  activity of p16(INK4a) regulators showed that stem cell depletion, reduced  proliferation, and p16(INK4a) upregulation in keratinocytes derived from the  chronologically and prematurely aged epidermis strongly correlate with Bmi-1  downregulation. In highly proliferative tissues, replicative and premature  senescence participate in determining senescent cell accumulation. Our findings  demonstrated that Bmi-1 is downregulated in human keratinocytes during both in vitro processes, in parallel with p16(INK4a) upregulation and accomplishment of  clonal conversion. When premature senescence was induced by specific exogenous  stimuli, concomitant Ets-1 upregulation was also observed. Moreover, Bmi-1 inhibited Ets-1-mediated p16(INK4a) upregulation. Finally, Bmi-1 overexpression  reduced p16(INK4a) promoter activity and decreased protein expression in aged  and diseased keratinocytes, inducing a delay of clonal conversion and an, Context: hydrogen peroxide induces premature senescence in NIH 3T3 cells and increases  endogenous caveolin-1 expression.

Interestingly, the opposing  dynamics of PRC2-Ezh2 and PRC2-Ezh1 at these muscle regulatory regions is  differentially regulated at the chromatin level by Msk1 dependent methyl/phospho  switch mechanism involving phosphorylation of serine 28 of the H3 histone  (H3S28ph).

When was vaxchora first licensed by the FDA?,"Yes, the context does provide an answer for this question. Vaxchora was first licensed by the FDA on June 10, 2016.","Context: efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally  downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus,  demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for  economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, the context indicates that isradipine is used for hypertension. This is based on its use in several studies mentioned in the context, including the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis","Context: dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa,  metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood  pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another  antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to  monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective  in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and  that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and  hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when  administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of  isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of  carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased  significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of  therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do.

These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has  proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a  stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood pressure, e.g. by a calcium antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain  barrier, is ineffective in reducing the infarct size, normalisation of blood  pressure alone cannot account for the reductions in infarct size observed with isradipine. The antihypertensive drug isradipine seems rather to offer the  additional benefit of attenuating the consequences of an eventual stroke. If  clinically confirmed, this will be of considerable therapeutic importance, Context: resistance to therapy. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides were  decreased by the end of the second year of treatment, and there was a tendency  toward increase in plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL2  or HDL3). The atherogenic index (ratio between total cholesterol and HDL2 plus  HDL3) was also decreased. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged in both  normoglycemic patients and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  (NIDDM) during 3 years of therapy. It is concluded that isradipine is safe and  effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients  with either hyperlipidemia or NIDDM","7789292, 15257873, 15257873, 2150641, 7946181",Isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients,"2137344, 11172743, 14727944, 15257873, 8963604, 12215829, 1363224, 10854683, 7848351, 9544865, 8466736, 7918132, 7955262, 10728516, 7946181, 7621840, 2949585, 8213473, 7738211, 7789292, 8205296, 2150641, 2523644, 7921533, 2523646"

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK,"Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regulatory submissions have also been made in the EU and other countries. Phase III development is ongoing  worldwide to evaluate ceritinib both as a first- and second-line therapy for  ALK-positive NSCLC. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of, Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib.

Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any ultraconserved elements associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context:  For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related, Context:  Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lef1  partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover,  depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse, Context: The co-occupancy of Tcf3 with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog on embryonic stem cell (ESC)  chromatin indicated that Tcf3 has been suggested to play an integral role in a  poorly understood mechanism underlying Wnt-dependent stimulation of mouse ESC  self-renewal of mouse ESCs. Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as  the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signalling suggested Tcf3-β-catenin  activation of target genes would stimulate self-renewal, here we show that an  antagonistic relationship between Wnt3a and Tcf3 on gene expression regulates  ESC self-renewal. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 replaced the requirement for  exogenous Wnt3a or GSK3 inhibition for ESC self-renewal, demonstrating that inhibition of Tcf3 repressor is the necessary downstream effect of Wnt  signalling. Interestingly, both Tcf3-β-catenin and Tcf1-β-catenin interactions  contributed to Wnt stimulation of self-renewal and gene expression, and the combination of Tcf3 and Tcf1 recruited Wnt-stabilized β-catenin to Oct4 binding  sites on ESC chromatin. This work elucidates the molecular link between the  effects of Wnt and the regulation of the Oct4/Sox2/Nanog network, Context:  Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require transcriptional regulation to ensure  rapid proliferation that allows for self-renewal. However, the molecular  mechanism by which transcriptional factors regulate this rapid proliferation remains largely unknown. Here we present data showing that CIBZ, a BTB domain  zinc finger transcriptional factor, is a key transcriptional regulator for  regulation of ESC proliferation. Here we show that deletion or siRNA knockdown of CIBZ inhibits ESC proliferation. Cell cycle analysis shows that loss of CIBZ  delays the progression of ESCs through the G1 to S phase transition. Conversely,  constitutive ectopic expression of exogenous CIBZ in ESCs promotes proliferation, Context:  Embryonic stem (ES) cells offer insight into early developmental fate decisions,  and their controlled differentiation may yield vast regenerative potential. The  molecular determinants supporting ES cell self-renewal are incompletely understood. The homeodomain proteins Nanog and Oct4 are essential for mouse ES  cell self-renewal. Using a high-throughput approach, we discovered DNaseI  hypersensitive sites and potential regulatory elements along a 160-kb region of the genome that includes GDF3, Dppa3, and Nanog.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, based on the context information, defects in recombination repair can lead to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. Specifically, the context mentions that tumor suppressors like p53 and BRCA","Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context:  DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) may be regarded as the two faces of  a coin: lowering the oncogenetic potential (precise repair with no consequences  on genomic status) or increasing it (deleterious action which may determine chromosome rearrangements such as loss of heterozigosity). Inherited mutations  in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a  prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Normal eukaryotic cells show some  degree of balance between various mechanisms of repair. This review presents the  main mechanisms and pathways of homologous recombination repair, Context: BACKGROUND: Slow progress in improving the outcome of ovarian cancer with  chemotherapy over the last decade has stimulated research into molecularly  targeted therapy. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors target DNA  repair and are specifically active in cells that have impaired repair of DNA by  the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Cells with mutated BRCA function have  HR deficiency (HRD), which is also present in a significant proportion of non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. DESIGN: In the last decade, olaparib, the first and most-investigated oral PARP  inhibitor, has undergone phase I-III trials as a single agent, in comparison with and in addition to chemotherapy, and as a maintenance therapy following  chemotherapy. RESULTS: The greatest benefit to-date has been in the maintenance setting,  prolonging the progression-free survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, Context: proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases, which have diverse roles in  multiple DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination and DNA  repair. In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified and three of them  namely, WRN, BLM and RecQL4 have been linked to genetic diseases characterized  by genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. This helicase  family plays important roles in various DNA repair pathways including protecting  the genome from illegitimate recombination during chromosome segregation in  mitosis and assuring genome stability. This review mainly focuses on various  roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in  the development of cancer and premature aging, Context: DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually  cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination, antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease.

In mammals, the Hippo orthologs Mst1  and Mst2 utilize the Salvador ortholog WW45/Sav1 and other scaffolds to regulate  the kinases Lats1/Lats2 and ndr1/ndr2. As in Drosophila, murine Mst1/Mst2, in a  redundant manner, negatively regulate the Yorkie ortholog YAP in the epithelial  cells of the liver and gut; loss of both Mst1 and Mst2 results in hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis that can be largely negated by reduction or  elimination of YAP. Despite this conservation, considerable diversification in  pathway composition and regulation is already evident; in skin, e.g., YAP phosphorylation is independent of Mst1Mst2 and Lats1Lats2. Moreover, in lymphoid  cells, Mst1/Mst2, under the control of the Rap1 GTPase and independent of YAP,  promotes integrin clustering, actin remodeling and motility while restraining, Context: The evolution of genomic imprinting in mammals occurred more than 100 million  years ago, and resulted in the formation of genes that are functionally haploid  because of parent-of-origin-dependent expression. Despite ample evidence from  studies in a number of species suggesting the presence of imprinted genes on  human chromosome 14, their identity has remained elusive. Here we report the  identification of two reciprocally imprinted genes, GTL2 and DLK1, which  together define a novel imprinting cluster on human chromosome 14q32. The  maternally expressed GTL2 (gene trap locus 2) gene encodes for a nontranslated  RNA. DLK1 (delta, Drosophila, homolog-like 1) is a paternally expressed gene that encodes for a transmembrane protein containing six epidermal growth factor  (EGF) repeat motifs closely related to those present in the delta/notch/serrate  family of signaling molecules. The paternal expression, chromosomal localization, and biological function of DLK1 also make it a likely candidate  gene for the callipyge phenotype in sheep. Many of the predicted structural and  regulatory features of the DLK1/GTL2 domain are highly analogous to those","11735383, 17980593, 17980593, 22898666, 11076856",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process, Context: signalling networks, we compared total proteome changes in mouse embryonic  fibroblasts knock out for H-ras and/or N-ras, using proteomics tools combining  2DE, semi-quantitative image analysis, in-gel trypsin digestion and mass  spectrometry.

MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration.

The context discusses adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, human emb","Context: PURPOSE: The incidence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has rapidly  increased, and with it, physician consultations and expenditures (about one and  a half times) in the last 5 years. Recent etiological studies reveal that AIS is  a complex genetic disorder that results from the interaction of multiple gene  loci and the environment. For personalized treatment of AIS, a tool that can  accurately measure the progression of Cobb's angle would be of great use. Gene analysis utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been developed as a  diagnostic tool for use in Caucasians but not Koreans. Therefore, we attempted  to reveal AIS-related genes and their relevance in Koreans, exploring the potential use of gene analysis as a diagnostic tool for personalized treatment  of AIS therein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 Korean AIS and 35 age- and sex-matched,  healthy adolescents were enrolled in this study and were examined for 10, Context: development. The hESC lines exhibited morphology and expressed markers typical  of hESCs. They demonstrated long-term proliferation capacity and pluripotent  differentiation. Karyotype analysis revealed that two-third of the cell lines  carry a normal euploid karyotype, while one-third remained aneuploid throughout  the derivation, resulting in eight hESC lines carrying either trisomy 13 (Patau  syndrome), 16, 17, 21 (Down syndrome), X (Triple X syndrome), or monosomy X  (Turner syndrome). On the basis of the level of single nucleotide polymorphism  heterozygosity in the aneuploid chromosomes, we determined whether the  aneuploidy originated from meiotic or mitotic chromosomal nondisjunction. Gene expression profiles of the trisomic cell lines suggested that all three  chromosomes are actively transcribed. Our analysis allowed us to determine which  tissues are most affected by the presence of a third copy of either chromosome 13, 16, 17 or 21 and highlighted the effects of trisomies on embryonic  development. The results presented here suggest that aneuploid embryos can serve  as an alternative source for either normal euploid or aneuploid hESC lines,, Context: coding genes with expression differences more than 2 folds between RKO, Lovo  cell lines and RKO cell line receiving 2Gy radiation.

Further experiment on P53, P21, cyclin D1  expression contents of RKO cell line was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.  RESULTS: Lovo(SF2=0.47) was more sensitivity to radiation than RKO(SF2=0.53)  according to the outcome of colony formation assay.

These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

This is stated in all the provided contexts, which mention that mutations in the TWIST1 gene are responsible for the majority of cases","Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common craniosynostosis syndromes.  It is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with variable expression that  is caused by germline mutations in the TWIST1 gene or more rarely in the FGFR2 or FGFR3 genes. We have previously reported that patients with Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here we have  analysed a cohort of 26 women with BRCA1/2-negative hereditary breast cancer to study whether a proportion of these families might have mutations in  Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes. DNA sequence analysis of TWIST1 showed no  pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence in any of the 26 patients. MLPA, Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders  of craniosynostosis in humans and is characterized by craniofacial and limb  anomalies. The locus for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome maps to chromosome 7p21-p22.

CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants  that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between  humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are  overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having  survived millions of years of purifying selection.

Here we review the latest, Context: Next-generation sequencing in clinical diagnostics is providing valuable genomic  variant data, which can be used to support healthcare decisions. In silico tools  to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have  evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its  classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA  mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from  InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do  predict pathogenicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.595, P < 0.001). However, we discovered  31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population  allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a  second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm  their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing  variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert  classification teams, Context: Many parameters included in the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial  Fibrillation (ATRIA) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension,  age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex  category) scores also predict coronary artery disease (CAD). We modified the  ATRIA score (ATRIA-HSV) by adding hyperlipidemia, smoking, and vascular disease  and also male sex instead of female. We evaluated whether the CHA2DS2-VASc,  CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, ATRIA, and ATRIA-HSV scores predict severe CAD. Consecutive  patients with coronary angiography were prospectively included. A ≥50% stenosis  in ≥1epicardial coronary artery (CA) was defined as severe CAD. Patient with normal CA (n = 210) were defined as group 1, with <50% CA stenosis (n = 178) as  group 2, and with ≥50% stenosis (n = 297) as group 3. The mean ATRIA, ATRIA-HSV,  CHA2DS2-VASc, and CHA2DS2VASc-HS scores increased from group 1 to group 3. A correlation was found between the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac  Surgery score and ATRIA (r = 0.570), ATRIA-HSV (r = 0.614), CHA2DS2-VASc (r =  0.428), and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (r = 0.500) scores (Ps < .005).

We sought for non-coding variants to  determine the clinical validity of common CADD scores.  METHODS: We evaluated 12,391 unique SNVs in 624 patient samples submitted for  germ-line mutation testing in a cancer-related gene panel. Stratifying by  genomic region, we compared the distributions of CADD scores of rare SNVs, SNVs  common in our patient population, and the null distribution of all possible  SNVs. RESULTS: The median CADD scores of intronic and nonsynonymous variants were  significantly different between rare and common SNVs (P < 0.0001). Despite these different distributions, no individual variants could be identified as plausibly  causative among the rare intronic variants with the highest scores. The  receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for noncoding variants is modest, and the positive predictive value of CADD for  intronic variants in panel testing was found to be 0.088.

Which annotated database of A-to-I RNA editing is available?,"Yes, based on the context information provided, there are annotated databases for A-to-I RNA editing in various metazoan species. These editomes were systematically characterized and examined to detect linkage of editing sites.","Context:  BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a highly conserved process that  post-transcriptionally modifies mRNA, generating proteomic diversity,  particularly within the nervous system of metazoans. Transcripts encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission predominate as targets of such  modifications. Previous reports suggest that RNA editing is responsive to  environmental inputs in the form of temperature alterations. However, the molecular determinants underlying temperature-dependent RNA editing responses  are not well understood. RESULTS: Using the poikilotherm Drosophila, we show that acute temperature, Context:  The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural, Context:  Pre-mRNA editing involving the conversion of adenosine to inosine is mediated by  adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2). ADARs contain multiple  double-stranded RNA(dsRNA)-binding domains in addition to an adenosine deaminase domain. An adenosine deaminase acting on tRNAs, scTad1p (also known as scADAT1),  cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a deaminase domain related to the ADARs  but lacks dsRNA-binding domains. We have identified a gene homologous to scADAT1 in the region of Drosophila melanogaster Adh chromosome II. Recombinant  Drosophila ADAT1 (dADAT1) has been expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and  purified. The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase, Context:  The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I),  which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. Here we assess  cotranscriptional A-to-I editing in Drosophila by isolating nascent RNA from adult fly heads and subjecting samples to high throughput sequencing. There are  a large number of edited sites within nascent exons. Nascent RNA from an  ADAR-null strain was also sequenced, indicating that almost all A-to-I events require ADAR. Moreover, mRNA editing levels correlate with editing levels within  the cognate nascent RNA sequence, indicating that the extent of editing is set  cotranscriptionally. Surprisingly, the nascent data also identify an excess of, Context:  RNA editing by deamination of specific adenosine bases to inosines during  pre-mRNA processing generates edited isoforms of proteins. Recoding RNA editing  is more widespread in Drosophila than in vertebrates. Editing levels rise strongly at metamorphosis, and Adar(5G1) null mutant flies lack editing events  in hundreds of CNS transcripts; mutant flies have reduced viability, severely  defective locomotion and age-dependent neurodegeneration. On the other hand, overexpressing an adult dADAR isoform with high enzymatic activity ubiquitously  during larval and pupal stages is lethal. Advantage was taken of this to screen  for genetic modifiers; Adar overexpression lethality is rescued by reduced","25555396, 29048557, 10629039, 22658416, 24137011","RADAR is a rigorously annotated database of A-to-I RNA editing.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA1 are FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, Ski, and HDAC1/2 containing NuRD","Context: OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay  (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells.  RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had comparable binding affinities to LDB1 with LMO2-L, and over expression of LMO2-C  prevented LMO2-L from binding to LDB1, the inhibition rate being (81.13 +/-  0.68)%. RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of GPA was reduced [(51.00 +/- 1.58)%] in K562 cells while LMO2-C overexpressed. CONCLUSION: LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and  down regulates the expression of GPA, Context: and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes. We propose that Ski  cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering  with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia.

Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: The activity of hematopoietic factor GATA-1 is modulated through  p300/CBP-mediated acetylation and FOG-1 mediated indirect interaction with  HDAC1/2 containing NuRD complex. Although GATA-1 acetylation is implicated in  GATA-1 activation, the role of deacetylation is not studied. Here, we found that  the FOG-1/NuRD does not deacetylate GATA-1. However, HDAC1/2 can directly bind  and deacetylate GATA-1. Two arginine residues within the GATA-1 linker region mediates direct interaction with HDAC1. The arginine to alanine mutation (2RA)  blocks GATA-1 deacetylation and fails to induce erythroid differentiation. Gene  expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis further demonstrate the importance of GATA-1 deacetylation for gene activation and chromatin recruitment. GATA-12RA  knock-in (KI) mice suffer mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with accumulation of  immature erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen.

Thus, identifying new therapeutic targets to treat Corynebacteria  infections is both medically and economically important. CG2496, a functionally  uncharacterized protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum, was evaluated using an  NMR ligand-affinity screen. A total of 11 compounds from a library of 460  biologically active compounds were shown to selectively bind CG2496 in a highly  conserved region of the protein. The best binder was identified to be  methiothepin (KD =54 ± 19 µM), an FDA-approved serotonin receptor antagonist. Methiothepin was also shown to inhibit the growth of C. glutamicum, but not  bacteria that lack CG2496 homologs. Our results suggest that CG2496 is a novel  therapeutic target and methiothepin is a potential lead compound or structural scaffold for developing new antibiotics specifically targeting Corynebacteria, Context: The p53 tumor suppressor is a potent transcription factor that plays a key role  in the regulation of cellular responses to stress. It is controlled by its  negative regulator MDM2, which binds directly to p53 and inhibits its  transcriptional activity. MDM2 also targets p53 for degradation by the  proteasome. Many tumors produce high levels of MDM2, thereby impairing p53  function. Restoration of p53 activity by inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction may  represent a novel approach to cancer treatment.

Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from  corresponding regions.

The selection experiments were initiated by crossing pairs of  inbred lines that had been derived from outbred laboratory populations that had  different mean life spans. QTL regions were located by association with  microsatellite markers that showed significant selection responses. Regions between recombination map positions 54 and 81 on chromosome 2, between 0 and 30  on chromosome 3, and near locations 49 and 81 on chromosome 3 had the strongest  support as locations of life-span QTL. There was good general agreement between the life-span QTL regions that were identified by selection and those that were  identified in a companion recombination mapping experiment that used the same  fly stocks. Many marker loci responded in opposite directions to selection for, Context: The role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  remains somewhat controversial. Several studies have shown increased production  of TNF alpha and IL-6 in patients with SLE. Increased production of IL-6, TNF  alpha, and IL-1 soluble receptors have also been reported. This finding is  provocative because the soluble receptors have the capacity to act as  antagonists. Several other inflammatory disorders are also associated with  increased production of soluble TNF alpha receptors suggesting that this may be  a general compensatory mechanism designed to down-regulate inflammation. The  recent identification of an SLE disease susceptibility locus near the TNFR2 locus (TNFR p75) suggested the hypothesis that genetically driven differences in  soluble TNFR2 production could play a role in the genetic susceptibility to SLE.  We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and  geographically matched controls. No difference in the gene frequency of the two  base-pair polymorphism in SLE patients compared to controls was found, nor was","20173741, 30094870, 30094870, 15454545, 11196716",There is a TNFR2 3' flanking region polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"11607787, 11169260, 11196716, 11197692, 10395102"

The context states that super-enhancers are large clusters of enhancers covering long regions of regulatory DNA and are","Context: mice. In control mice, labeled axons were restricted primarily to s.  lacunosum-moleculare. However, in pilocarpine-treated animals, a rich plexus of  ChR2-eYFP-labeled fibers and boutons extended into the dentate molecular layer.  Electron microscopy with immunogold labeling demonstrated labeled axon terminals  that formed symmetric synapses on dendritic profiles in this region, consistent  with innervation of granule cells. Patterned illumination of ChR2-labeled fibers  in s. lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 and the dentate molecular layer elicited  GABAergic inhibitory responses in dentate granule cells in pilocarpine-treated  mice but not in controls. Similar optical stimulation in the dentate hilus evoked no significant responses in granule cells of either group of mice. These  findings indicate that under pathological conditions, SOM/GABAergic neurons can  undergo substantial axonal reorganization beyond their normal territory and establish aberrant synaptic connections. Such reorganized circuitry could  contribute to functional deficits in inhibition in epilepsy, despite the  presence of numerous GABAergic terminals in the region, Context: A substantial fraction of phenotypic differences between closely related species  are likely caused by differences in gene regulation. While this has already been  postulated over 30 years ago, only few examples of evolutionary changes in gene  regulation have been verified. Here, we identified and investigated binding  sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPa) aiming to  discover cis-regulatory adaptations on the human lineage. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments in a human cell line, we  found 11,619 putative GABPa binding sites. Through sequence comparisons of the  human GABPa binding regions with orthologous sequences from 34 mammals, we identified substitutions that have resulted in 224 putative human-specific GABPa  binding sites. To experimentally assess the transcriptional impact of those  substitutions, we selected four promoters for promoter-reporter gene assays, Context: markers. We show that the absence of α1-GABAAR increases GABAergic synapses  containing the α2 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and  NL2; in contrast, the absence of NL2 produces highly variable effects  postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe  for the GABAAR subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin. Altogether, the results  confirm the importance of NL2 as organizer of the GABAergic PSD and unravel  distinct roles for α1- and α2-GABAARs in the formation of GABAergic circuits in  close interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, Context: knockout (CKO) mice have impaired growth and decreased survival. Cortical and  hippocampal GABAergic interneurons of CKO mice are enlarged and show increased  mTORC1 signaling. Total numbers of GABAergic cells are reduced in the cortex  with differential reduction of specific GABAergic subtypes. Ectopic clusters of  cells with increased mTORC1 signaling are also seen suggesting impaired  interneuron migration. The functional consequences of these cellular changes are  evident in the decreased seizure threshold on exposure to the proconvulsant  flurothyl. These findings support an important role for the Tsc1 gene during  GABAergic interneuron development, function, and possibly migration, Context:  The transcriptional regulation of genes determines the fate of animal cell  differentiation and subsequent organ development. With the recent progress in  genome-wide technologies, the genomic landscapes of enhancers have been broadly explored in mammalian genomes, which led to the discovery of novel specific  subsets of enhancers, termed super-enhancers. Super-enhancers are large clusters  of enhancers covering the long region of regulatory DNA and are densely occupied by transcription factors, active histone marks, and co-activators.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context when it mentions that ""stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules"" and later refers to ""cytoplasm","Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance, Context: mutation carriers, healthy controls, and patients with sporadic ALS. METHODS: Western blots and immunocytochemistry were performed to study the  subcellular localization of FUS protein. Control and stressed cells were double  stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes.

However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells.

To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene.

Which viruses are best known to cause myocarditis?,"Yes, enteroviruses are best known to cause myocarditis. The context states that ""Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomy","Context:  Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It  has been shown that inflammatory markers may play a role in the pathogenesis of  heart failure. Therefore, inflammatory markers and anticytokine therapy in heart failure have become the attractive subjects in the literature. There are new  studies regarding this issue in the literature. In this article, we reviewed  inflammatory markers in heart failure and their prognostic significance based on the literature data, Context: fundamental to this process, several RIPK3-related pathways such as endoplasmic  reticulum stress and mitochondrial fragmentation have also been implicated in  cardiac I/R injury. In this review, reports from both in vitro and in vivo  studies regarding the roles of necroptosis and RIPK3-regulated necrosis in  cardiac I/R injury have been collectively summarized and discussed. Furthermore,  reports on potential interventions targeting these processes to attenuate  cardiac I/R insults to the heart have been presented in this review. Future  investigations adding to the knowledge obtained from these previous studies are  needed in the pursuit of discovering the most effective pharmacological agent to improve cardiac I/R outcomes, Context: beginning to be understood. Because the SERCA pump plays a major role in muscle  contraction, a number of investigations have focused on understanding its role  in cardiac and skeletal muscle disease. These studies document that SERCA pump  expression and activity are decreased in aging and in a variety of  pathophysiological conditions including heart failure. Recently, SERCA pump gene  transfer was shown to be effective in restoring contractile function in failing  heart muscle, thus emphasizing its importance in muscle physiology and its  potential use as a therapeutic agent, Context: in distilled water); Group C (BPA-treated rats): 10 mg/kg/day BPA suspended in  0.2 ml corn oil; Group D (BPA + GA-treated rats): BPA (10 mg/kg/day) with a  concomitant GA (20 mg/kg/day). All treatments were orally administered for 14  days. BPA induced significant decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial  blood pressure while causing a significant (p < 0.05) increase in heart rate in  the rats. It significantly (p < 0.05) raised both renal and cardiac reactive  oxygen species and depleted the antioxidant system. There were also significant  (p < 0.05) increases in serum myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide, urea and creatinine  in the BPA-treated rats. Lesions of the heart and kidney including inflammation, vascular congestion and erosion of epithelial cells were also observed in the  BPA-treated rats. However, the concomitant treatment with GA ameliorated all the  BPA-induced alterations of the cardio-renal system. Hence, low dose of GA serves a protective function against BPA-induced toxicity of the heart and kidney, Context:  Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute  myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"No, the context does not provide information about the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients.","Context:  BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in thyroid function are frequent in patients with  heart failure and are associated with increased mortality. However, the relation  between thyroid hormone levels and echocardiographic parameters has not been investigated sufficiently. AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlations of thyroid  hormone levels with echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate their  associations with subsequent mortality in a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 111 consecutive  patients with DCMP (35 female, 76 male, mean age: 62+/-12 years). All patients, Context: RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports, Context: Effects of thyroid gland hormones on cardiovascular system have been known for  many years. Thyroid gland hormones deficiency is connected with a range of  metabolic and hemodynamic changes which can contribute to a genesis of heart  failure. Recent works refer to an importance of connection of thyroid gland  hormones metabolism with heart insufficiency pathophysiology. That is especially  a syndrome of a low trijodthyronin level marked as euthyroid sick syndrome which is significantly more frequent in patients with chronic heart failure compared  to a population of healthy individuals. Recent clinical works proved that  treatment administration of thyroid gland hormones to patients with heart failure is connected with favourable hemodynamic changes and increased working  capacity if the treatment is well tolerated, Context: which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart.  In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In  addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the  frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The decrease in T3 serves as an  indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to  increased mortality. In animal models, it can be shown that in pressure  overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy a decrease of thyroid hormone receptor levels occurs. Cardiac function can be improved by increasing expression of  thyroid hormone receptors mediated by adeno-associated virus based gene  transfer. The failing heart may develop a ""hypothyroid"" status contributing to diminished cardiac contractile function, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3  administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic  rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to","15642542, 17893267, 15521205, 19125327, 8936683",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. The context describes how hesperidin can prevent changes in locomotor activity and PPI response, reduce oxidative damage, and protect against cellular ab","Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 µl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused  oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted  super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial, Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C. In hippocampal slice preparations, whole-cell patch clamp  experiments showed that hesperidin reduced the frequency of spontaneous, Context:  We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress. We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-α gene  expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological  function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

The least-squares mean difference between the sotatercept 0.3-mg group and the  placebo group in the change from baseline to week 24 in pulmonary vascular  resistance was -145.8 dyn · sec · cm-5 (95% confidence interval [CI], -241.0 to, Context: sotatercept 0.3-mg group and the placebo group in the change from baseline in  6-minute walk distance was 29.4 m (95% CI, 3.8 to 55.0). The least-squares mean  difference between the sotatercept 0.7-mg group and the placebo group was 21.4 m  (95% CI, -2.8 to 45.7). Sotatercept was also associated with a decrease in  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Thrombocytopenia and an  increased hemoglobin level were the most common hematologic adverse events. One  patient in the sotatercept 0.7-mg group died from cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sotatercept resulted in a reduction in pulmonary  vascular resistance in patients receiving background therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases.
