What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown that genetic events targeting this modification, particularly at H3K9 and H3K27, contribute to the pathogen","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene in humans encodes for DNA polymerase θ. This is explicitly stated in the first sentence of the context.","Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by, Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes.

It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.

The enzyme is uniquely able to, Context: Potential DNA replication accessory factors from the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae have previously been identified by their ability to bind to DNA  polymerase alpha protein affinity matrices (J. Miles and T. Formosa, Proc. Natl.  Acad. Sci. USA 89:1276-1280, 1992). We have now used genetic methods to  characterize the gene encoding one of these DNA polymerase alpha-binding  proteins (POB1) to determine whether it plays a role in DNA replication in vivo. We find that yeast cells lacking POB1 are viable but display a constellation of  phenotypes indicating defective DNA metabolism. Populations of cells lacking  POB1 accumulate abnormally high numbers of enlarged large-budded cells with a single nucleus at the neck of the bud. The average DNA content in a population  of cells lacking POB1 is shifted toward the G2 value. These two phenotypes  indicate that while the bulk of DNA replication is completed without POB1,, Context: Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a member of the family Poxviridae and  pathogenic to humans. MCV causes benign epidermal tumors mainly in children and  young adults and is a common pathogen in immunecompromised individuals. The  viral DNA polymerase is the essential enzyme involved in the replication of the  genome of DNA viruses. The identification and characterization of the gene  encoding the DNA polymerase of molluscum contagiosum virus type 1 (MCV-1) was carried out by PCR technology and nucleotide sequence analysis. Computer-aided  analysis of known amino acid sequences of DNA polymerases from two members of  the poxvirus family revealed a high amino acid sequence homology of about 49.7% as detected between the DNA polymerases of vaccinia virus (genus Orthopoxvirus)  and fowlpoxvirus (genus Avipoxvirus).

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, there are four lncRNAs regulated by SAM68 mentioned in the context. They are Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68.

The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method that uses a seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique.

Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline.

To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage, Context: proteins. Loss of function of PIWI proteins and/or the piRNA loci on the genome  lead to derepression of transposons and causes severe defects in gametogenesis  and fertility. The necessity for both PIWI proteins and piRNAs in protecting the  genome of the gametes from mischievous mobile genomic elements is thus obvious.  There have been extensive biochemical and genetic studies on PIWI proteins and  piRNAs. These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene  silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing  relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for  gametogenesis and fertility.","23124062, 18809914, 23124062, 25336588, 20080197",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough details about what a ""minimal genome build"" is. The concept of a ""minimal genome"" is discussed in the context, but it refers to the smallest set of genes required for life,","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 (also known as PR-Set7) is a cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase that mediates monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H","Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks.

The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells., Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?,"Yes, a de novo mutation in FGFR3 causes achondroplasia.

Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions.

The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor.

We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway.

Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: Encephalitis induced by reovirus serotype 3 (T3) strains results from the  apoptotic death of infected neurons. Extrinsic apoptotic signaling is activated  in reovirus-infected neurons in vitro and in vivo, but the role of intrinsic  apoptosis signaling during encephalitis is largely unknown. Bax plays a key role  in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of  mitochondrial cytochrome c. We found Bax activation and cytochrome c release in neurons following infection of neonatal mice with T3 reoviruses. Bax(-/-) mice  infected with T3 Abney (T3A) have reduced central nervous system (CNS) tissue  injury and decreased apoptosis, despite viral replication that is similar to that in wild-type (WT) Bax(+/+) mice. In contrast, in the heart, T3A-infected  Bax(-/-) mice have viral growth, caspase activation, and injury comparable to  those in WT mice, indicating that the role of Bax in pathogenesis is organ, Context:  Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins has the ability to  form transmembrane pores large enough to allow cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, as  well as to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP); however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, the 3D structure of the genome is not static during cell differentiation. Instead, it undergoes dynamic rearrangement as part of the process. This is demonstrated in the review, where it states that ""the hierarchy","Context: Recent burst of new technologies that allow for quantitatively delineating  chromatin structure has greatly expanded our understanding of how the genome is  organized in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus. It is now clear  that the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome critically impacts  nuclear activities such as transcription, replication, as well as cellular and  developmental events such as cell cycle, cell fate decision and embryonic  development. In this review, we discuss new insights into how the structural  features of the 3D genome hierarchy are established and maintained, how this  hierarchy undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development and how its perturbation will lead to human disease, highlighting the accumulating evidence  that links the diverse 3D genome architecture components to a multitude of human  diseases and the emerging mechanisms by which 3D genome derangement causes disease phenotypes., Context:  The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene  expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand  the link between genome organization and function. Yet, the factors involved and the mechanisms by which the 3D organization of the nucleus is established remain  poorly understood. The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based  approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins  orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of  interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The, Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside, Context: It can be convenient to think of the genome as simply a string of nucleotides,  the linear order of which encodes an organism's genetic blueprint. However, the  genome does not exist as a linear entity within cells where this blueprint is  actually utilized. Inside the nucleus, the genome is organized in  three-dimensional (3D) space, and lineage-specific transcriptional programs that  direct stem cell fate are implemented in this native 3D context. Here, we review  principles of 3D genome organization in mammalian cells. We focus on the  emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific  transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked., Context: organization of the eukaryotic genomes. Chromatin insulators have emerged as one  of the central components of the genome organization tool-kit across species.  Recent advancements in chromatin conformation capture technologies have provided  important insights into the architectural role of insulators in genomic  structuring. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple  spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin  structure during reprogramming and differentiation.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context there is no evidence that thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The context states that all individuals expressing the RTH phenotype","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1.

Here, we  review evidence for the efficacy and safety of these novel psoriasis therapies,  providing clinicians with an overview of the next era in immunotherapy for  psoriasis., Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab  neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor.

The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms.

A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen.

In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: men; disease duration, 0.9 year [SD, 0.7]; mean UPDRS part I to III score, 23.1  [SD, 8.6]); 95% of patients completed the study. Adjusted least-squares mean  changes in total UPDRS score in the antiparkinson medication ON state over 36  months for isradipine and placebo recipients were 2.99 (95% CI, 0.95 to 5.03)  points versus 3.26 (CI, 1.25 to 5.26) points, respectively, with a treatment  effect of -0.27 (CI, -3.02 to 2.48) point (P = 0.85). Statistical adjustment for  antiparkinson medication use did not change the findings. Secondary outcomes  showed no effect of isradipine treatment. The most common adverse effects of  isradipine were edema and dizziness. LIMITATION: The isradipine dose may have been insufficient to engage the target  calcium channels associated with neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with immediate-release isradipine did not slow the clinical progression of early-stage PD. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke., Context: of isradipine treatment. The mean age of children treated with isradipine was  74+/-55 months (mean+/-SD). Nearly all of these children had secondary  hypertension and were initially treated as hospital inpatients for newly  diagnosed hypertension. Mean isradipine dose was 0.36+/-0.17 mg/kg per day, with  no significant variation in dose according to patient age. Isradipine was  administered three times per day in most instances, but 21% of the time it was  administered four times per day. An extemporaneous isradipine suspension was  used in 62% of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with isradipine alone  in 38 children; the remainder received isradipine in combination with additional antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8+/-9 days  later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with isradipine treatment, with a  mean reduction of 14+/-13 mmHg for systolic BP and 13+/-15 mmHg for diastolic BP. There was no effect of isradipine treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects  occurred in 9.5% of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing,  dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that isradipine successfully lowers BP, Context: As it was reported earlier that isradipine, a Ca superset 2+ antagonist of  dihydropyridine derivative class, caused regression of nifedipine-induced  hyperplasia of human gingiva, experiments were performed to examine whether or  not isradipine would solely inhibit the proliferation of cultured gingival  fibroblasts. Normal human gingival fibroblast Gin-1 cells were used to test the  impact of this medication. Fibroblast proliferation in the presence of isradipine (10 microM) was examined by using the reagent water-soluble  tetrazolium-1 (WST-1).

Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro., Context: tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes  (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput  genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations. Here, we have  mutagenised the Ptch+/- murine tumour model using the Sleeping Beauty transposon  system to identify additional genes and pathways involved in SHH subgroup  medulloblastoma development.  RESULTS: Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and  identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically  mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription  factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1  and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotype. Furthermore, activity of  this network varied significantly between the human subgroups, was associated  with metastatic disease, and predicted poor survival specifically within the SHH, Context: INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumor in  the pediatric population, accounting for 20-25% of all brain tumors in children.  Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in  medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,"Yes, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is inhibited by LB-1","Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) inhibitor. It has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK,"Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs.

This system employs Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and, Context:  BACKGROUND: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate  melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger  groups of dermatologists are lacking.

Recently, independent studies have demonstrated  that post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs is also disrupted in HD.  Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is  repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. These changes  occur downstream of REST, and are likely to result in major disruption of mRNA  regulation and neuronal function. In this study we will discuss these findings  and their implications for our understanding of HD. Using updated bioinformatic  analysis, we predict 21 new candidate microRNAs in HD. We propose future  strategies for unifying large-scale transcriptional and microRNA datasets with the aim of explaining HD aetiology. By way of example, we show how available  genomic datasets can be integrated to provide independent, analytical validation  for dysregulation of REST and microRNA mir-124 in HD. As a consequence, gene ontology analysis indicates that HD is characterised by a broad-based depression  of neural genes in the caudate and motor cortex.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%).

RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001).

Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology.

A method to image apoptosis in vivo, rather than requiring  histologic evaluation of tissue, could assist with therapeutic decision making  in these disorders. Programmed cell death is associated with a  well-choreographed series of events resulting in the cessation of normal cell  function, and the ultimate disappearance of the cell.

Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"Yes, there are ultraconserved elements (UCEs) associated with ESC self-renewal. Specifically, the context highlights that dual inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK","Context: BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved elements of DNA have been identified in vertebrate  and invertebrate genomes. These elements have been found to have diverse  functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The  evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined. RESULTS: Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human. In addition to a well-known association with developmental genes, these DNA elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential  cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate  immunity, and sensory reception. Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved, Context: Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating  T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid  enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lef1  partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover,  depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs without exogenous factors, cytokines or inhibitors. Transcriptome  resequencing analysis reveals that LEF1 is closely associated with endoderm  specification in ESCs. Thus, our study adds support to the notion that the key to maintaining the ESC ground state is to shield ESCs from differentiative cues., Context:  Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK).

These human-mouse-rat sequences, which represent  ultraconserved elements (UCEs), are believed to be important for functions  involving DNA binding, RNA processing and the regulation of transcription and  development. In vivo and additional computational studies of UCEs and other highly conserved sequences are consistent with these functional associations,  with some observations indicating enhancer-like activity for these elements.  Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental  duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating,  along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a  distinct subset., Context: Previously known to function in the thymus stromal cells and peripheral lymphoid  organs respectively, Aire and Deaf1 help regulate the ectopic expression of  diverse tissue-specific antigens to establish self-immune tolerance.  Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern  similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse  ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as  attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In  addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed  in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown. These results suggest that transcription factors such as Aire and Deaf1, which exert global  transcriptional regulatory functions, may play important roles in self-renewal  of ESCs and maintaining ESC in a transcriptionally hyperactive state.","23217155, 28288968, 28288968, 16998490, 20226168","Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes.

This research estimates the risk for all readmissions  rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440  admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate  ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method  used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the  accuracy of both the LACE and PARR models. As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, according to the context, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. The text states that enhanced telomeric recombination in human cells with mismatch-repair defects may contribute to cell immort","Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,, Context: mismatch-repair function promotes cellular proliferation in the absence of  telomerase. Defects in mismatch repair, including mutations that correspond to  the same amino-acid changes recovered from HNPCC tumours, enhance  telomerase-independent survival in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a related  budding yeast with a degree of telomere sequence homology that is similar to  human telomeres. These results indicate that enhanced telomeric recombination in  human cells with mismatch-repair defects may contribute to cell immortalization  and hence tumorigenesis., Context:  Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology  directed or non-homologous repair pathways. Defects in components of DSB repair  pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer. The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer,  are involved in homology-directed DSB repair. Defects in another  homology-directed pathway, single-strand annealing, are associated with genome instability and cancer predisposition in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome and a  radiation-sensitive ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome. Many DSB repair  proteins also participate in the signaling pathways which underlie the cell's  response to DSBs., Context: androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide resulted in significantly improved  antitumor efficacy compared with respective single-agent treatments in  hormone-dependent prostate cancer, and addition of EBRT resulted in even further  enhanced antitumor efficacy.

These genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis.","Context: (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on  the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the  physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also  induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We  also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or  proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.  Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication  cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: Virus-induced cell death is a determinant of pathogenesis. Mammalian reovirus is a versatile experimental model for identifying viral and host  intermediaries that contribute to cell death and for examining how these factors  influence viral disease. In this study, we identified that in addition to apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death, reovirus is capable of inducing an  alternate form of controlled cell death known as necroptosis. Death by this  pathway perturbs the integrity of host membranes and likely triggers, Context: neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in  the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis., Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome. Loss of  endocytic nTSGs transforms imaginal disc epithelia into highly proliferative,  invasive tissues that fail to differentiate and display defects in cellular  apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of neoplastic transformation in vertebrates.

In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH., Context: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic  and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease  process.

RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins. All alpha-Kaps contain a central domain composed  of eight approximately 40 amino acid, tandemly arranged, armadillo-like (Arm)  repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals.

Secondary-structural prediction  algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of  all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were  investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation.  The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts.

All patients were  seen at the Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health & Science University over a  9-year period (2003-2012). Demographic data, presence of RD and/or vitritis, and  treatments were reviewed. Main outcome measures were the rate of RD in ocular  toxoplasmosis, degree of vision loss, and final anatomical status of the retina.  Disease- and treatment-related factors associated with poor visual outcome were  also analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five eyes of 28 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis and  sufficient follow-up were studied. Median age of patients was 40 years (range,  7-93 years). Median follow-up time was 22.5 months (range, 6-96 months). Four of thirty-five eyes (11.4%) developed RD with a frequency of 0.06 RD events per  patient-year of follow-up in this sample in a single center. Of four patients  with RD, three underwent pars plana vitrectomy and one underwent laser retinopexy. Two of the 4 patients had recurrent RD requiring scleral buckle. At  final follow-up, all patients who underwent surgical repair had attached  retinas; however, 3 of 4 patients had severe vision loss (20/200 or worse)., Context: Ocular toxoplasmosis is present in 20% of infected immunocompetent individuals.  Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of posterior uveitis in immunocompetent  subjects and congenital toxoplasmosis transmission was the first parasite to be  linked to human lesions in the eye. An experimental model for congenital ocular  toxoplasmosis was developed in C57BL/6 mice with the purpose to evaluate  Toxoplasma induced ocular pathology during fetal life. Toxoplasma gondii, ME-49  strain, was used to infect pregnant females. Histological analysis of pre-natal  fetal eyes from infected female mice, did not show parasite infestation,  however, alterations were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and in the inner nuclear layers (INL) of the retina. Edema was also observed, characterized  by the increase of interstitial spaces forming lacunae between the ONL and INL  cells and a net of vessels associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate. These histological observations suggest that ocular lesions are not delayed  manifestations of toxoplasmosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the nature of the latter in treated cases of the disease and to assess their impact on visual function. METHODS: Four hundred and thirty consecutive children with serologically  confirmed congenital toxoplasmosis were included in this study.

The presence of retinochoroiditis and of associated pathologies was ascertained,  and their impact on visual function was assessed., Context: Ocular toxoplasmosis is present in 20% of infected immunocompetent individuals.  Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of posterior uveitis in immunocompetent  subjects and congenital toxoplasmosis transmission was the first parasite to be  linked to human lesions in the eye. An experimental model for congenital ocular  toxoplasmosis was developed in C57BL/6 mice with the purpose to evaluate  Toxoplasma induced ocular pathology during fetal life. Toxoplasma gondii, ME-49 strain, was used to infect pregnant females. Histological analysis of pre-natal  fetal eyes from infected female mice, did not show parasite infestation,  however, alterations were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and in the inner nuclear layers (INL) of the retina. Edema was also observed, characterized  by the increase of interstitial spaces forming lacunae between the ONL and INL  cells and a net of vessels associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate.","25127047, 17596951, 15906073, 15906073, 17596951",Retinochoroiditis is the most frequent manifestation of congenital toxoplasmosis Infectious uveitis accounted for 37% of posterior uveitis cases of which toxoplasmosis was the most common cause.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about the indications for bupropion. Three indications for bupropion are as an antidepressant, as a tobacco use cessation agent, and as a treatment for psychostimul","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: self-administration.

Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in  gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), particularly in immunosuppressed recipient hosts. However,  in the latest packaging cell lines and vectors, the risk of RCR-generation has  been drastically reduced, primarily by minimizing the homologous overlap between","21247248, 16717285, 7624311, 21247248, 14683449","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, tumour specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. This is suggested in the context by discussions of using antigens expressed by tumors in vaccines and identifying tumour antigens that can be presented by H","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: Vaccination with antigens expressed by tumors is one strategy for stimulating  enhanced T-cell responses against tumors. However, these peptide vaccines rarely  result in efficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells or responses that  protect against tumor growth. Mimotopes, or peptide mimics of tumor antigens,  elicit increased numbers of T cells that crossreact with the native tumor  antigen, resulting in potent antitumor responses. Unfortunately, mimotopes may  also elicit cells that do not crossreact or have low affinity for tumor antigen.  We previously showed that one such mimotope of the dominant MHC class I tumor  antigen of a mouse colon carcinoma cell line stimulates a tumor-specific T-cell clone and elicits antigen-specific cells in vivo, yet protects poorly against  tumor growth. We hypothesized that boosting the mimotope vaccine with the native  tumor antigen would focus the T-cell response elicited by the mimotope toward high affinity, tumor-specific T cells. We show that priming T cells with the  mimotope, followed by a native tumor-antigen boost, improves tumor immunity  compared with T cells elicited by the same prime with a mimotope boost.

From the results some rules about the pathways for tumor-associated  re-expression of these antigens can be deduced. Le(a) antigen expression was  significantly correlated with the CA 50 and Le(b) antigens. The significant relation observed between A-, H1-, and Le(b) antigen formation in MTC suggests  the existence of a carcinoma-associated fucosyltransferase committing the type 1  precursor chain along the H1-antigen pathway, and by further glycosylation to an A-, B-, or a Le(b) antigen. Comparative studies of tumor-associated H type 1 and  H type 2 antigen expression revealed that H type 2 antigen synthesis was  significantly related to a blood type 0 in the host. On the other hand, H1, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

The copynumber package provides a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation of copy number data. The CNV","Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented.

These packages  provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the  genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and  coverage vectors. Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for  overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range  operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other  Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential  expression analysis and visualization., Context: BACKGROUND: With the advancement in high-throughput technologies, researchers  can simultaneously investigate gene expression and copy number alteration (CNA)  data from individual patients at a lower cost. Traditional analysis methods  analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn  diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and  inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible  approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in  the same individual. RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple  input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two  real microarray datasets demonstrated that the CNA-driven genes identified by  the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a  genomic region with CNA. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC  package showed better performance., Context: SUMMARY: Copy number variation (CNV) is a major type of structural genomic  variation that is increasingly studied across different species for association  with diseases and production traits.

RESULTS: We enrolled 2056 patients (mean age 68.0 yr, 1046 (50.9%) women) who  had a rate of stroke of 1.8% at 7 days and 3.2% at 90 days. An ABCD2 score of more than 5 had a sensitivity of 31.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-47.5)  for stroke at 7 days and 29.2% (95% CI 19.6-41.2) for stroke at 90 days.

CADD scores, software and documentation are available at  https://cadd.gs.washington.edu., Context: OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these  patients. The potential prognostic factors that are known to influence survival  such as general condition, extraspinal bone metastases, vertebral bone  metastases, visceral metastases, and neurologic assessment based on Frankel  score were also studied. METHODS: The predicted survival according to the four scoring systems were  calculated and labeled as ""A"" scores. These patients were then rescored by  assigning NPC as a good prognostic tumor and labeled as ""B"" scores. The  predicted survival of scores A and B were compared with actual survival.  Potential prognostic factors of survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. For all scoring systems, Kaplan-Meier  survival estimates and log-rank tests were done; the predictive values were  calculated using postestimation after Cox regression analyses.

The  significance and limits of these scoring systems, and the future perspectives  were described. Tokuhashi score, Tomita score, Baur score, Linden score, Rades  score, and Katagiri score were introduced. They are all scoring systems prepared  by combining factors that affect prognosis. The primary site of cancer and  visceral metastasis were common factors in all of these scoring systems. Other factors selected to influence the prognosis varied. They were useful to roughly  predict the survival period, such as, ""more than one year or not"" or ""more than  six months or not"". In particular, they were utilized for decision-making about operative indications and avoidance of excessive medical treatment. Because the  function depended on the survival period in the patients with metastatic spine  tumor, it was also utilized in assessing functional prognosis.

The accuracy rate of prognosis in T15 was  significantly improved in the prostate (P = 0.0032) and breast group (P <  0.0001). CONCLUSION: Both T12 and T15 showed significant predictive value in patients  with spinal metastases. T15 has a statistically higher accuracy rate than T12.  Among the various cancer groups, the 2 scoring systems are especially reliable  in prostate and breast metastases groups. T15 is recommended as superior to T12  because of its higher accuracy rate.","21646462, 30371827, 24912121, 25035829, 21796024","Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders.

Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?,"Yes, according to the first context excerpt, surgery for ovarian endometriomas can improve the success rates of fertility treatment.

Pregnancy rates in patients  receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15)  before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively. In post-menopausal women, the  median (quartile) age at menopause was similar in the study (n=9) and control  groups (n=6) [48 (45-52) versus 49 (44-52) years, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced  long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no  contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve  the success rates of fertility treatment., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs.  PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed. CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical, Context:  Endometriosis affects 2-50% of women at reproductive age. Surgery is an option  for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a  significant improvement in fertility. Also, the removal of ovarian endometrioma might lead to a reduction in the follicular reserve and response to stimulation.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of previous ovarian  surgery for endometriosis on the ovarian response in assisted reproduction treatment cycles and its pregnancy outcome. A total of 61 women, with primary  infertility and previously having undergone ovarian surgery for endometriosis,  who had received 74 IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles, were, Context: recommended for women above the age of 40 and for large endometriomas. Except  for pelvic clearance, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that surgical  treatment of endometrioma is better than medical treatment with respect to the  long-term relief of symptoms and quality of life. Laparoscopic excision of  ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over  expectant management. A large, well-designed, adequately powered randomized  controlled study that compares the effects of surgical removal versus expectant  management of endometrioma on ovarian performance and pregnancy outcomes in  women undergoing IVF is warranted., Context: Laparoscopic excision is considered as the 'gold standard' treatment of ovarian  endometrioma. However, a frustrating aspect is that disease can recur. While  laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause  significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. It is therefore  crucial to prevent recurrence in order to conserve 'improved' fertility.  Recurrence rates for endometrioma are reported from 11 to 32% within 1-5 years after excision. The recurrence rate is higher in patients with advanced  endometriosis at surgery and in younger patients. Previous medical treatment for  endometriosis prior laparoscopy is a risk factor for recurrence. Pregnancy soon after surgery has a protective effect for recurrence.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab is PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9).

Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: clinical studies have demonstrated the high selectivity of these antibodies for  the PCSK9 pathway and their long-term safety and efficacy.

In addition,  evolocumab has been approved by the FDA for homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of PCSK9  inhibitors are unknown., Context: by PCSK9 and ANGPTL3. RECENT FINDINGS: Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting PCSK9, evolocumab  and alirocumab, significantly reduce LDL-C levels in HeFH patients. In patients  with HoFH, the efficacy of mAbs to PCSK9 is strictly related to the presence of  a residual LDLR activity; thus, patients carrying null mutations do not respond  to the therapy with these mAbs, whereas some effects can be appreciated in HoFH  bearing defective mutations. Conversely, evinacumab, the mAb targeting ANGPTL3,  is highly effective in reducing LDL-C levels even in HoFH patients carrying null  LDLR mutations, thanks to its LDLR-independent mechanism of action. Monoclonal antibodies inhibiting PCSK9 have shown a robust effect in FH patients presenting  a residual LDLR activity, while ANGPTL3 inhibitors appear to be promising even  in patients carrying null LDLR mutations., Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved.

Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms. We compared the results of the different methods by  applying five different performance measurement metrices.

We performed exome sequencing on two  siblings who had no known pathogenic mutations for DBA and identified a mutation  in the gene encoding the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1. This  mutation, which occurred at a splice site of the GATA1 gene, impaired production  of the full-length form of the protein. We further identified an additional  patient carrying a distinct mutation at the same splice site of the GATA1 gene.  These findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of DBA, showing that the reduction in erythropoiesis associated with the disease can arise from causes  other than defects in ribosomal protein genes. These results also illustrate the  multifactorial role of GATA1 in human hematopoiesis.","19534736, 18844071, 18844071, 18844071, 22706301","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes.

In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: INTRODUCTION: The majority of human sarcomas, particularly soft tissue sarcomas,  are relatively resistant to traditional cytotoxic therapies.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, camels are the animals thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS.

While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV.

Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed., Context: SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different  geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah  virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged  in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not  match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV),  which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).  Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an  animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the  possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but  higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing  number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and  moderate transmissibility.

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not provide information about a resource developed to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. The context discusses various resources and studies related to gene regulation in hematopoietic cells, gen","Context: elements of the α-globin super-enhancer individually and in informative  combinations, we demonstrate that each constituent enhancer seems to act  independently and in an additive fashion with respect to hematological  phenotype, gene expression, chromatin structure and chromosome conformation,  without clear evidence of synergistic or higher-order effects. Our study  highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for the identification  of new concepts in transcriptional regulation., Context:  Genomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and  post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In  this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer  lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by  them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate  imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin  compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning., Context: abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two  coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: (ATAC-seq). By leveraging on cell-to-cell transcriptome and chromatin  accessibility heterogeneity, we identify different previously unknown cardiac  subpopulations. Reconstruction of developmental trajectories reveal that  multipotent Isl1+ CPC pass through an attractor state before separating into  different developmental branches, whereas extended expression of Nkx2-5 commits  CPC to an unidirectional cardiomyocyte fate. Furthermore, we show that CPC fate  transitions are associated with distinct open chromatin states critically  depending on Isl1 and Nkx2-5. Our data provide a model of transcriptional and  epigenetic regulations during cardiac progenitor cell fate decisions at  single-cell resolution., Context: During blood cell development, hematopoietic stem cells generate diverse mature  populations via several rounds of binary fate decisions. At each bifurcation,  precursors adopt one fate and inactivate the alternative fate either  stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cell","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance, Context:  Stress granules (SGs) are RNA-containing cytoplasmic foci formed in response to  stress exposure. Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been  described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications). Most of these components are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or are involved in RNA  metabolism and translation. SGs have been linked to several pathologies  including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia  (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure  to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease, Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.","20674093, 24090136, 29298433, 26557057, 29129640",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans.

Interestingly, the results strongly suggest that Rap1 can  contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can Abf1. Also,  consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss  of binding than those that bind Rap1. Finally, we show for several such genes  that the Abf1 C-terminal region, which contains the putative activation domain,  is not needed to confer this peculiar 'memory effect' that allows continued  transcription after loss of Abf1 binding., Context:  Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to  transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to  replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast.

Moreover, the frequent presence of Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells.","19712444, 17158163, 17158163, 27262581, 27262581",Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417
Which viruses are best known to cause myocarditis?,"Yes, Coxsackie B viruses are best known to cause myocarditis.

Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle., Context: INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation  of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy was  identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to  H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our  knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H1N1 with  myocarditis in pregnancy.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29  and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory  manifestations of H1N1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence.

Specifically, antiphospholipid antibodies were found to be mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during","Context: placental abruption. We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function.

Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.

Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies. Therapists need to have precise knowledge of human, Context: Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical  evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma., Context:  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Subdural spinal hematoma (SDH) is a very rare entity;  however, it can lead to serious complications resulting from injuries to the  spinal cord and roots.

Additionally, most patients also develop some neu","Context: diagnosis is often difficult in all but the classical presentation. The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract.
