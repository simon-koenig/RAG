What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,Recent studies showed that frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas suggest a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. High expression of polycomb genes,"Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: Epigenetic marks such as histone modifications play roles in various chromosome  dynamics in mitosis and meiosis. Methylation of histones H3 at positions K4 and  K79 is involved in the initiation of recombination and the recombination  checkpoint, respectively, during meiosis in the budding yeast. Set1 promotes  H3K4 methylation while Dot1 promotes H3K79 methylation. In this study, we  carried out detailed analyses of meiosis in mutants of the SET1 and DOT1 genes  as well as methylation-defective mutants of histone H3. We confirmed the role of  Set1-dependent H3K4 methylation in the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs)  in meiosis for the initiation of meiotic recombination, and we showed the involvement of Dot1 (H3K79 methylation) in DSB formation in the absence of  Set1-dependent H3K4 methylation. In addition, we showed that the histone H3K4  methylation-defective mutants are defective in SC elongation, although they seem to have moderate reduction of DSBs. This suggests that high levels of DSBs  mediated by histone H3K4 methylation promote SC elongation","23179372, 24797370","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,Monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1) is mediated by PR-Set7.,"Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation","23302691, 27131378",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context states that when isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells were treated with recombinant protein Bax, cytochrome c release was observed, indicating that BAX can indeed trigger the release of cytochrome c.","Context: p73, an important developmental gene, shares a high sequence homology with p53  and induces both G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the molecular  mechanisms through which p73 induces apoptosis are unclear. We found that  p73-induced apoptosis is mediated by PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of  apoptosis) induction, which, in turn, causes Bax mitochondrial translocation and  cytochrome c release. Overexpression of p73 isoforms promotes cell death and bax promoter transactivation in a time-dependent manner. However, the kinetics of  apoptosis do not correlate with the increase of Bax protein levels. Instead,  p73-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax is kinetically compatible with the induction of cell death. p73 is localized in the nucleus and remains nuclear  during the induction of cell death, indicating that the effect of p73 on Bax  translocation is indirect. The ability of p73 to directly transactivate PUMA and, Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,The IL-17 receptor.,"Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi.

This detail is provided in the context as ""Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.""","Context: BACKGROUND: Current drugs for myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated  myelofibrosis, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, do not induce complete  or partial remissions. Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide  that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity  and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis. Imetelstat was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion  (starting dose, 9.4 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 1 to 3 weeks. The  primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points were adverse events, spleen response, and independence from red-cell  transfusions. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (median age, 67 years) met the eligibility  criteria; 48% had received prior JAK inhibitor therapy. A complete or partial, Context: Telomeres and telomerase play essential roles in the regulation of the lifespan  of human cells. While normal human somatic cells do not or only transiently  express telomerase and therefore shorten their telomeres with each cell  division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy","26332545, 20072842","Imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA subunit.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination (HR) can be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to carcinogenesis.,"Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis.

These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,","16717285, 21247248","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance, Context: Rbfox RNA-binding proteins play important roles in the regulation of alternative  pre-mRNA splicing, but their role in other gene regulatory mechanisms is not  well understood. Here, we show that Rbfox2 is a novel constituent of cytoplasmic  stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to  cellular stress. We also show that the RNA binding activity of the Rbfox family  protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to  identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a  subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1  mRNA and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure. Our  study proposes a novel function for Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules","29298433, 28894257",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"
What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes.,"Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder  characterised by facial dysmorphisms, growth and psychomotor development delay,  and skeletal defects. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context states that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context:  Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously, Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells","12200417, 27262581",Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity,12200417
What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The study found a relationship between thyroid hormones and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. Specifically, it was observed that heart failure can lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart, which may be related to the increased levels of","Context: Cytokines and thyroid hormones are involved in the biochemical changes  associated to heart failure (HF). AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the  cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy subjects (30 males, age range 26-75 years) were also enrolled as control group  (Group N). High sensitivity (hs)-IL-6 and hs-TNFalpha were quantified using  solid phase sandwich ELISA kits. Hs-CRP was measured by Immulite System, Context: involve influences on calcium flux, with thyroid hormone promoting expression of  the gene encoding the calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCa2). In  contrast, in hypothyroid animals phospholamban levels, which inhibit the SERCa2  pump, are increased. In addition, marked effects are exerted on the calcium  channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum the ryanodine channel. Related to  myofibrillar proteins, myosin heavy chain alpha is increased by T3 and MHC beta  is decreased. Complex and interesting interactions occur between cardiac  hypertrophy induced by excess thyroid hormone action and cardiac hypertrophy  occurring with heart failure. The thyroid hormone mediated cardiac hypertrophy in its initial phases presents a physiological hypertrophy with increases in  SERCa2 levels and decreased expression of MHC beta. In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart","19926244, 19125327",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against 3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations.,"Context:  Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 µl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired, Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP.
