Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as epigenetic  regulators of gene transcription. The diversity and complexity of lncRNA genes  means that they exert their regulatory effects by a variety of mechanisms. Although there is still much to be learned about the mechanism of lncRNA  function, general principles are starting to emerge. In particular, the  application of high throughput (deep) sequencing methodologies has greatly advanced our understanding of lncRNA gene function. lncRNAs function as adaptors  that link specific chromatin loci with chromatin-remodeling complexes and  transcription factors. lncRNAs can act in cis or trans to guide",24149621,"Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239

The web service built on top of the graph database  provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but  also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying  graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing  a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph  database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex  biological data types",29377902,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,The SET7/9 methyltransferase deposits a methyl mark at lysine 4 of histone H3.,"Context: Histone posttranslational modifications are among the epigenetic mechanisms that  modulate chromatin structure and gene transcription. Histone methylation and  demethylation are dynamic processes controlled respectively by histone  methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs). Several HMTs and HDMs have  been implicated in cancer, inflammation, and diabetes, making them attractive  targets for drug therapy. Hence, the discovery of small-molecule modulators for  these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone H3.

However, in general, Annexin V is known to bind to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells","Context: Apoptotic cells possess specific morphological and biochemical markers. Various  methods have been developed to detect apoptosis based on these markers. One of  the most common is the fragmentation of genomic DNA. In addition to  electrophoresis for the identification of the characteristic 200 base pair  ladders and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick  end-labeling, DNA content analysis is often employed. This technique is based on the fact that permeablized apoptotic cells release fragmented DNA, resulting in  DNA content that is less than that in live diploid cells. Although widely used,  we have found that the number of apoptotic cells detected by DNA content analysis is often lower than that detected by other methods.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. DNA replication cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination is crucial for maintaining genome integrity, and defects in these processes can lead to carcinogenesis.","Context: DNA replication is a primary mechanism for maintaining genome integrity, but it  serves this purpose best by cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA  repair and recombination. Unlike leading strand synthesis, lagging strand  synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a  significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a  proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Third, the principal  mechanism of Okazaki fragment processing is via generation of flaps, which have  the potential to form a variety of structures in their sequence context. Finally, many proteins for the lagging strand interact with factors involved in  repair and recombination.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"No.  The context only mentions lithium's neuroprotective effects in relation to glycogen synthase kinase-3 and inositol monophosphatase-1, but does not mention hesperidin.","Context: Lithium is used as a first line treatment in bipolar disorder. The  neuroprotective effects of lithium in this indication tend to be well known and  are mediated by its action on two enzymes: glycogen synthase kinase-3 and  inositol monophosphatase-1. Preclinical and clinical studies seek to evaluate  the neuroprotective effect of lithium in neurodegenerative disorders. The aims  of this literature review is to gather clinical studies that investigated the efficacy of lithium in neurodegenerative diseases, using a systematic method  based on PubMed data. Results were found concerning Alzheimer's disease and  related dementias, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spino-cerebellar ataxia. Lithium exposure showed a potential neuroprotective  effect in studies on psychiatric populations with a lower prevalence of  Alzheimer's disease in exposed patients.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,Activin type II receptors (ActRII).   This is mentioned in the background section of the text as a description of what bimagrumab is.,"Context:  BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab",29566437,Bimagrumab blocks the activin type II receptors.,30095981
List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,A nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B is implicated in the autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.,"Context: The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding  disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth  factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome, is key to megakaryocyte and platelet development",24325358,GFI1B and NBEAL2 mutations are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"23861251, 21765412, 25258341, 21765413, 24325358, 23100277"
