What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Genetic events targeting H3K9 methylation are frequently observed in medulloblastomas, and copy number aberrations of genes","Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation, Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"Yes, the POLQ gene encodes for DNA polymerase θ in humans. This is explicitly stated in the context.","Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs.

Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis.

Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining.""

It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered).

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition characterized by the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.

CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: identified a C>T transition at nucleotide position c.718. This nucleotide change  resulted in the substitution of highly conserved arginine by cysteine at codon  240 (R240C). This nucleotide substitution was not seen in any unaffected member  of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family.

In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin, Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context: Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the  mutations of FBN1 gene. We report on a family with ectopia lentis. The  propositus is a 6-year-old boy with bilateral superior-temporal ectopia lentis.  His echocardiogram was normal and he did not meet the revised Ghent criteria for  Marfan syndrome. Molecular genetic testing revealed c.1948 C>T (p.Arg650Cys) in  FBN1. The mother has visual acuity of 20/20 with -4.50 right eye and -2.50 left  eye. She has no evidence of ectopia lentis. DNA analysis revealed that she has  the same FBN1 mutation. Seven other maternal family members also have ectopia  lentis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, according to the context, piRNAs are indeed involved in gene silencing. They protect the genome from invasive transposable elements in the germline by repressing transposons post-transcriptionally and/or","Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation, Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world, Context: associates with various kinds of piRNAs. Although in ovaries Aub-associated  piRNA populations are quite diverse, piRNAs with Aub in testes show a strong  bias. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts  of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene  silencing. The second most abundant class was made up of those from chromosome X  and showed strong complementarity to vasa transcripts. Immunopurified Aub-piRNA  complexes from testes displayed activity in cleaving target RNA containing  sequences complementary to Stellate and vasa transcripts. These results provide  the first biochemical insights into gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Aub and piRNAs in fly testes, Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context:  In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART","18809914, 23124062, 17872506, 26279487, 21764773",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

This unit details how Oligopaint  probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: This work is concerned with more complex geometric properties, i.e., the  complete shape formed by genomic regions. Our work is based on statistical shape  theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures,  e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution,  and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random. In addition, we  found that the shapes of active and inactive X-chromosomal genomic regions are  statistically independent. Moreover, we reconstructed the average 3D structure of chromatin in a small genomic region (below 4 Mb) based on five BACs resulting  from two overlapping four BAC regions.

The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription.

Ubiquitylation of CMG in  yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only  detectable site of ubiquitylation both in vitro and in vivo (though in vivo  other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates  in vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model  whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome  replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction, Context:  The eukaryotic replisome is rapidly disassembled during DNA replication  termination. In metazoa, the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase CUL-2LRR-1 drives  ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase, leading to replisome disassembly by the p97/CDC-48 ""unfoldase"". Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution with in vivo  studies in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, to show that the replisome-associated  TIMELESS-TIPIN complex is required for CUL-2LRR-1 recruitment and efficient CMG helicase ubiquitylation. Aided by TIMELESS-TIPIN, CUL-2LRR-1 directs a suite of  ubiquitylation enzymes to ubiquitylate the MCM-7 subunit of CMG.

Serial HER-2/neu determinations after surgery, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3.

Which is the protein encoded by the human gene GRIK?,"Yes, the human gene GRIK encodes for a protein. More specifically, it encodes for a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor.","Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor.

Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human  tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in  primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys.

Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin.

We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker.

Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane  permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c and consequently cancer cell death. A number of drugs in clinical use are  known to indirectly activate Bax. Intriguingly, recent efforts demonstrate that  Bax can serve as a promising direct target for small-molecule drug discovery, Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids.

We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival, Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels.

The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling.

When was vaxchora first licensed by the FDA?,"Yes, the context does provide an answer for this question. Vaxchora was first licensed by the FDA in June 2016. This information can be found in the second sentence of the context.","Context:  In October 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the first  serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine (MenB-FHbp [Trumenba, Wyeth  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) as a 3-dose series. In January 2015, FDA licensed a second MenB vaccine (MenB-4C [Bexsero, Novartis Vaccines]) as a 2-dose series.  Both vaccines were approved for use in persons aged 10-25 years. Following  outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on two college campuses in 2013, both MenB vaccines were granted Breakthrough Therapy designations, which  expedites drug development and review by FDA, and were licensed based on  accelerated approval regulations. On February 26, 2015, the Advisory Committee, Context: efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally  downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus,  demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for  economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine.

What is ceritinib?,"Yes, according to the context, ceritinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations. It is an oral medication used for treating non-small cell lung cancer","Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib, Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib, Context: patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently  overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively  inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a  cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this  increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two  crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these  mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired  resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can  overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several  crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib. These findings  provide the molecular basis for the marked clinical activity of ceritinib in  patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib-resistant disease. Cancer, Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs, Context: of the next-generation ALK TKI, ceritinib (LDK378), in the setting of crizotinib  resistance. An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired  resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of  patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently  overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively  inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a  cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this  increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two  crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired  resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can  overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.

Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Yes, the VAC regimen for Ewing's sarcoma includes vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide. This is explicitly stated in the context information provided.","Context:  Ewing's sarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour occurring in children  and adolescents and exists in two different clinicopathological entities:  osseous Ewing's sarcoma (OES) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES). Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific  symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22  years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical  exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant  radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine,, Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway, Context: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) could improve mean arterial pressure (MAP),  myocardial contractile parameters (+/- dp/dtmax, Vpm and Vmax) and increase  plasma epinephrine level significantly at 10 min after TRH administration in  hemorrhagic shock rabbits, but the action of TRH on MAP and the myocardial  contractility did not appear in rabbits pre-treated with reserpine (4 mg/kg, 24  h pre-treatment, i.v.).

RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the  base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various  sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to  57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference  threshold of 15% for oncology.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker because it binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells. This property is widely used in flow cytometry-based apopt","Context: Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the  immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology. The application of Annexin V, Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin.

METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin.

Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid  enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs.

These elements have been found to have diverse  functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The  evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined.

FINDINGS: The efficacy and safety of linagliptin and empagliflozin as  monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs has been  established through extensive clinical trial programs. Studies specifically  evaluating the efficacy/safety of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor/sodium  glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in combination are limited, but do include  two studies of linagliptin/empagliflozin of up to 52 weeks in duration. These  studies show that the single-pill combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin produced clinical improvements in glycemic control that were generally superior  to the improvements seen with linagliptin and empagliflozin alone, but with a  safety profile comparable to that of the individual constituents.

Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding. Medications such as ferrous sulfate, hydralazine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide  are thought to play a role as well.

Harms appear to be predominantly related to the use of  etizolam in illicitly manufactured pills and occur almost exclusively in the  context of mixed-drug toxicity. CONCLUSION: In therapeutic doses, there is little to suggest that etizolam is  more harmful than other benzodiazepines. Most harms with etizolam appear to be  related to the wide availability of illicitly manufactured pills, which are  taken in unknown doses and combined with other substances.

Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02× increased  odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031,  CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic  curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day  readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts  a 0.98× reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99,  C-statistic = 0.70).

Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, YAP and TAZ are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki. This is stated in the context where it mentions ""Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional","Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five  sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein, Context: vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity.

Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway, Context: Genetic screens in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified a class  of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (endocytic nTSGs), which encode proteins  that localize to endosomes and facilitate the trafficking of membrane-bound  receptors and adhesion molecules into the degradative lysosome.

Future efforts with  lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy, Context: The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial  pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated  with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and  bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab  was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have  previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,  preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the  binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques,  we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP  domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189, Context: Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of  CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC).

Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled  on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5  mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and  lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean  duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days.

These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood.

Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: of signals and their transmission led to the discovery and the use of Bone  Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). The development of cellular therapy led to the  emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which  include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV).  Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have  successfully been transfected. The ability to control transfected cells and the  capacity to combine and transfect many genes involved in osseous healing will  improve gene therapy, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production. Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated.","24120896, 16251873, 12686720, 23921576, 15912200, 23843498, 23884859, 19435468, 23845071, 23860311, 23845947, 23845948, 21943326"

Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion.

This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait.

The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems.

Established protocols for experimental detection and computational inference of CNVs from SNP array and next-generation  sequencing data are available. We present the CNVRanger R/Bioconductor package  which implements a comprehensive toolbox for structured downstream analysis of CNVs. This includes functionality for summarizing individual CNV calls across a  population, assessing overlap with functional genomic regions, and genome-wide  association analysis with gene expression and quantitative phenotypes, Context: epigenomic marker. Our empirical analysis shows that the method yields  reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional  important changes in histone modifications. To further explore the broader  applicability of MMDiff, we apply it to two ENCODE data sets: one investigating  the histone modification H3K27ac and one measuring the genome-wide binding of  the transcription factor CTCF. In both cases, MMDiff proves to be complementary  to count-based methods. In addition, we can show that MMDiff is capable of  directly detecting changes of homotypic binding events at neighbouring binding  sites. MMDiff is readily available as a Bioconductor package. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that higher order features of ChIP-Seq  peaks carry relevant and often complementary information to total counts, and  hence are important in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding.

In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course, Context: PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates. RESULT(S): Aside from lower peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG and a higher  total FSH dose in women previously operated for an endometrioma, no significant  differences were found between the two groups in the different IVF variables  analyzed.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, Evolocumab targets the enzyme PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). This information is provided in the context.","Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context:  To date HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are the most effective drugs for reduction  of LDL-cholesterol levels and for prevention of cardiovascular events.  Inhibition of the enzyme PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), which is involved in depletion of the LDL-receptor, is a new pharmacologic  approach. Inhibition of PCSK9 by monoclonal antibodies provokes an additional  reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels by 50-60 % in addition to statins. Previous phase III studies indicate good compatibility.

Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner.

More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells.

In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.

Antibody cross-linking can be done in 1 h while  antibody coupling requires 4 h. IP or co-IP is accomplished by incubating the  antibody resin with the protein sample. Washes and elutions are carried out in a  spin column to reduce resin loss and decrease assay time. Target proteins are eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.8) and the resin-bound antibody is  re-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for reuse.

There is a lot  of unknown characterization regarding MERS-CoV because of less than one year  after finding the first case. MERS-CoV was related to the 2C betacoronavirus  clade and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and  Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Thus, bats are thought to be natural hosts of  this virus. Recently, there were reports supposed to be cases of human to human  infection. There are growing concerns about spread of infection, Context: phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ  structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs  exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately  terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and  zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian  peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from  camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is  unlikely to become endemic in humans, Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches","24769571, 25791336, 24769571, 29336306, 25791336",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

We found no association at all between the TNFR2 polymorphism and any  autoimmune diseases including SLE in Japanese, Context: The role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  remains somewhat controversial. Several studies have shown increased production  of TNF alpha and IL-6 in patients with SLE. Increased production of IL-6, TNF  alpha, and IL-1 soluble receptors have also been reported. This finding is  provocative because the soluble receptors have the capacity to act as  antagonists. Several other inflammatory disorders are also associated with  increased production of soluble TNF alpha receptors suggesting that this may be  a general compensatory mechanism designed to down-regulate inflammation. The  recent identification of an SLE disease susceptibility locus near the TNFR2 locus (TNFR p75) suggested the hypothesis that genetically driven differences in  soluble TNFR2 production could play a role in the genetic susceptibility to SLE.  We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and  geographically matched controls. No difference in the gene frequency of the two  base-pair polymorphism in SLE patients compared to controls was found, nor was, Context:  We recently reported the association of the allele coding for Arg at the  position 196 (196R: nucleotide [nt] 587G) of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2  (TNFR2, TNF-R75) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese. In the present study, we completed the variation screening of the entire coding region  of TNFR2. Three new single nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding sequence  (cSNPs), as well as several variations within the promoter, introns and 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR), were identified. Among the new SNPs, nt168G, a  synonymous substitution (K56K), was in tight linkage disequilibrium with nt587G.

These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8.

These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells, Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, according to the context, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. The context states that mutant-FUS can form inclusions in the cytoplasm and large PABP1-positive cytopl","Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response, Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism, Context: expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides.

This suggests that","Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells, Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead  operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes,, Context: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the large majority of the genes coding for  cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (RPs) depend on the general regulatory factor  Rap1 for their transcription, but a small cohort of them relies on Abf1  regulatory activity. A recent study showed that unlike Rap1, whose association  with RP gene promoters is not affected by environmental changes causing RP gene  repression/reactivation, Abf1 association with both RP gene and ribosome  biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells, Context: described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains, Context: regulatory activity.

Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of  cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia, Context: placental abruption.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. According to the context, hesperidin has been shown to prevent changes in locomotor activity and PPI response, reduce cellular abnormalities, and","Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression, Context:  Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats.

When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.

The  purpose of this study was to assess whether PGI(2) analogues could affect T  helper (Th) cell responses in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy  donors (HD). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33  patients with SSc and 29 HD. Cytokine levels in PBMC and monocyte/CD4 T cell  cultures were quantified by immunoassays. The frequencies of interleukin  (IL)-17A, IL-22, interferon γ (IFNγ) and IL-4-producing CD4 T cells were  assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Selective receptor antagonists, cytokine blocking antibodies and signalling protein inhibitors were used to  identify the receptors and signalling pathways mediating PGI(2) analogue  effects. RESULTS: Th17 and Th22 cells were more abundant in individuals with SSc than in HD. PGI(2) analogues (iloprost, treprostinil and beraprost) significantly  increased IL-17A and IL-22 in vitro while decreasing IFNγ production both in SSc  and HD PBMC. These effects relied on the specific expansion of Th17 and Th22 and, Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are substances that result from the biotransformation of a parent compound (drug) in the body. They are often more chemically reactive than the parent drug and can bind covalently to","Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity, Context: methide of TGZ and N-acetylcysteine. From electrochemical oxidations of  rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and ciglitazone in the presence of GSH, no GSH  conjugates could be identified. These three compounds all contain a  thiazolidinedione moiety. In conclusion, it has been shown that the primary  reactive metabolite of TGZ formed from electrochemical oxidation was the  o-quinone methide, and this metabolite was similar to what was observed to be  the primary reaction product in human and rat liver microsomes, Context: The decline in approval of new drugs during the past decade has led to a close  analysis of the drug discovery process. One of the main reasons for attrition is  preclinical toxicity, frequently attributed to the generation of  protein-reactive drug metabolites. In this review, we present a critique of such  reactive metabolites and evaluate the evidence linking them to observed toxic  effects. Methodology for the characterization of reactive metabolites has advanced greatly in recent years, and is summarized first. Next, we consider the  inhibition of key metabolic enzymes by electrophilic metabolites, as well as  unfavorable drug-drug interactions that may ensue. One important class of protein-reactive metabolites, not linked conclusively to a toxic event, is acyl  glucuronides. Their properties are discussed in light of the safety  characteristics of carboxylic acid containing drugs. Many adverse drug reactions, Context:  Although idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are rare, they are still a major  concern to patient safety. Reactive metabolites are widely accepted as playing a  pivotal role in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. While there are today well established strategies for the risk assessment of stable  metabolites within the pharmaceutical industry, there is still no consensus on  reactive metabolite risk assessment strategies.

Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine.

The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  a systemic autoimmune disease which affects multiple organs. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes skin symptoms seen in SLE and cutaneous-limited LE.  Although immune abnormalities, as well as heritable, hormonal and environmental  factors, are involved in the pathology of LE, the actual pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, the involvement of various cytokines has been shown in the  pathogenesis of LE. Moreover, some trials with biological agents targeted  specific cytokines are also ongoing for SLE. In this article, we review the, Context:  The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE. Any part of the  heart can be affected, including the pericardium, myocardium, coronary arteries,  valves, and the conduction system. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, a high incidence of CAD has become increasingly recognized as a cause of  mortality, especially in older adult patients and those with long-standing SLE.  Many unanswered questions remain in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac manifestations of SLE. It is not currently possible to predict the  patients who are at greatest risk for the various types of cardiac involvement.  However, with the rapid advancement of basic science and translational research, Context: BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE.  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10 was considered active and severe disease. RESULTS: Eleven SLE patients (9 females and 2 males) had DLE (18.3%) and 49  patients (46 females and 3 males) had SLE without DLE (81.7%).
