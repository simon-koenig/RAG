What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas,","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation., Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent, Context: was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations  that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent  mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1  (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly  affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich  repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone  methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for  histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in  multiple cohorts of HCC.","23179372, 19270706, 14688019, 14688019, 23728943","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 273 AIS patients, aged (14.6 +/- 2.1)  (10 - 18), and 287 healthy age-matched females adolescents. The anthropometric  parameters of the AIS group, including age, body height, weight, arm span, Cobb  angle, time of menarche, and Risser's sign were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used  to detect the FBN3 gene distribution.

Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks. Seven mRNAs (ANKRD34A, FMODA, GJA3, CNTN5, BMP10, BAI2  and HS3ST6) were involved in both networks of LNC_00035 and LNC_000466. Differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling pathways, such as  ""phosphorylation"", ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"", ""endocytosis"" and  ""MHC protein complex"".

The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD.","29137239, 29137239, 29137239, 29228702, 34608503","Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites.",29137239
What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye becomes subluxated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It can be isolated or occur as part of systemic conditions like Mar","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes, Context:  PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated  ectopia lentis (EL) family. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were collected from the  family including sixteen patients with isolated EL. Blood samples of nine patients, one normal person and two unknown children's were collected. Genomic  DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood. Genotyping was performed  by microsatellite markers and logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE Programs. Mutation screening in the candidate gene,  fibrillin-1 (FBN1), was performed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Linkage to the FBN1 locus is verified. Mutation screening in FBN1, Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a zonular disease where alteration of the zonular fibers  leads progressively to lens dislocation. It is most often associated with  systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome or homocystinuria. Isolated non syndromic ectopia lentis (IEL) is reported in  families with autosomal inheritance, with dominant forms being more common than  recessive. LTBP2 truncating mutations have been described as a cause of autosomal recessive ectopia lentis as a primary or secondary feature in patients  showing ocular (eg, glaucoma) or extraocular manifestations (eg, Marfanoid  habitus).

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. R","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets. RESULTS: Here, we present 'RIblast', an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction  method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions  using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA  secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that  RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing  programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online., Context: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized  by the presence of nucleic acid- and protein-targeting autoantibodies and an  aberrant type I IFN expression signature. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an  autosomal-recessive encephalopathy in children that is characterized by  mutations in numerous nucleic acid repair enzymes and elevated IFN levels.  Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads., Context: determine masses of both 30S subunits and intact 2.3 MDa 70S ribosomes from  Thermus thermophilus. The masses of both particles are consistent with multiple  populations of ribosomes. To identify these various populations we combine  simulated mass spectra of ribosomes, with and without the full protein  complement, and estimate the extent of adducts from our study of known  complexes. The results allow us to determine the contribution of the different  subpopulations to the overall mass spectrum. We confirm the existence of these  subpopulations using tandem mass spectrometry of intact 30S subunits. Overall,  the results show that, rather than uniform particles, gas-phase ribosomes consist of a number of discrete populations. More generally, the results  establish a rigorous procedure for accurate mass measurement and spectral  analysis of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies., Context: BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, pure red blood cell aplasia of  childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors. About 40% of  patients display various malformations. Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment  in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell  transplantation. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19,  are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than  25% of cases. Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of  patients show that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis.  Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of  patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding  sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia who were negative for  RPS19 mutations. RESULTS: About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and  only 1.6% in RPS24.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. Additionally, they can target endogenous mRNAs and initiate sustained silencing via the","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing.

Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating  RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing., Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown.

Our work is based on statistical shape  theory and we use different approaches to analyze the considered structures,  e.g., shape uniformity test, 3D point-based registration, Fisher distribution,  and 3D non-rigid image registration for shape normalization. We have applied  these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four  consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by  multicolor FISH. We have acquired two sets of four consecutive genomic regions  with an overlap of three regions. From the experimental results, it turned out that for all data sets the complete structure is non-random.

Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were  carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were  sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. Data from the PGM runs were  processed using an Ion Torrent Suite 3.2 software to generate sequence reads.  After sequence alignment and extraction of SNPs and indels, all the variants  were filtered against dbSNP137. DNA sequences were visualized with an Integrated Genomics Viewer. The most likely disease-causing variants were analyzed by  Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The PGM sequencing has yielded an output of 855.80 Mb, with a > 100 ×  median sequencing depth and a coverage of > 98% for the targeted regions in all the four samples.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed, but no specific build is mentioned. Additionally, the context states that a universal minimal genome remains elusive due","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state.

In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from endosymbionts and are the result of coevolutionary interactions with a host; few  such organisms are ""free-living."" As few, if any, biological systems exist in  complete isolation, we expect that, as with modern life, early biological systems were part of an ecosystem, replete with organismal interactions. We  favor refocusing discussions of the evolution of cellular systems on processes  rather than gene counts. We therefore draw a distinction between a pragmatic, Context: bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell., Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the second context, Set7 (also known as PR-Set7) is a histone H4 methyltransferase that deposits monomethylation on histone H4 lysine 20 (H","Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: histone code will require a complete understanding of all the modifications that  putatively contribute to it. Here, using the top-down mass spectrometry approach  for identifying PTMs on full-length histones, we report that lysine 37 of  histone H2B is dimethylated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By  generating a modification-specific antibody and yeast strains that harbor  mutations in the putative site of methylation, we provide evidence that this  mark exist in vivo. Importantly, we show that this lysine residue is highly  conserved through evolution, and provide evidence that this methylation event  also occurs in higher eukaryotes. By identifying a novel site of histone methylation, this study adds to our overall understanding of the complex number  of histone modifications that contribute to chromatin function., Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes.","23355544, 12208845, 21249157, 24681537, 19687145",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Besides the specific  features of achondroplasia, synostosis of the metopic, coronal, lambdoid, and  squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried  out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common  achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as  molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any  additional genetic alteration. It is suggested that this unusual phenotype is a result of variable expressivity of the common achondroplasia mutation., Context:  Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000  live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed  dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals,  suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals  are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%).

RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon  380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene  mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid  and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of  achondroplasia., Context: Achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism in humans, occurs  between 1 in 15,000 and 40,000 live births.

We show that UBXN-3 is important in vivo for  replisome disassembly in the absence of TIMELESS-TIPIN. Correspondingly,  co-depletion of UBXN-3 and TIMELESS causes profound synthetic lethality. Since, Context:  The eukaryotic replisome is rapidly disassembled during DNA replication  termination. In metazoa, the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase CUL-2LRR-1 drives  ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase, leading to replisome disassembly by the p97/CDC-48 ""unfoldase"". Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution with in vivo  studies in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, to show that the replisome-associated  TIMELESS-TIPIN complex is required for CUL-2LRR-1 recruitment and efficient CMG helicase ubiquitylation.

Subsequently,  the UBXN-3 adaptor protein directly stimulates the disassembly of ubiquitylated, Context: Ufd1-Npl4 complex recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG. Ubiquitylation of CMG in  yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only  detectable site of ubiquitylation both in vitro and in vivo (though in vivo  other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates  in vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model  whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome  replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction., Context: The components of the replisome that preserve genomic stability by controlling  the progression of eukaryotic DNA replication forks are poorly understood. Here,  we show that the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex allows the MCM (minichromosome  maintenance) helicase to interact with key regulatory proteins in large  replisome progression complexes (RPCs) that are assembled during initiation and  disassembled at the end of S phase. RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the  Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA  barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion. RPCs also interact  with Mcm10 and topoisomerase I. During initiation, GINS is essential for a  specific subset of RPC proteins to interact with MCM.

RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score  and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38,  respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system  overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system  underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS: Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict  prognosis of spinal metastases after operation. Tokuhashi scoring system can predict early death more accurately, which can be used to avoid major operation  for these patients., Context: PURPOSE: The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate  indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal  disease. Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for  metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted  survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to  determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS: This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with  MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009  were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected prospectively to October 2011. Patients were divided into three groups--Group 1  (Tokuhashi score 0-8, n = 84), Group 2 (Tokuhashi score 9-11, n = 83) and Group  3 (Tokuhashi score 12-15, n = 34). Data collected included demographic data,, Context: survival. The absolute score of all scoring systems was significantly associated  with actual survival, which extended to the different prognostic subgroups of  each scoring systems. Log-rank test revealed significant differences in survival  between the different prognostic subgroups of all scoring systems (p<.01).  Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among  all four scoring systems.  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good  survival prognosis. All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate  these patients.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,"Yes, HER-2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of proteins. This is stated in the second sentence of the first context block. The EGFR family includes four transmembrane","Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context:  HER-2/neu, also known as c-erbB-2/neu, is an oncogene located in chromosome 17  which encodes HER-2/neu, a transmembrane protein belonging to the EGFR family.  The external domain of this protein is released by the cell and can be studied in serum by immunoassay. HER-2/neu in serum is a specific tumor marker and only  slight elevations may be found in the absence of malignancy, mainly in  association with liver diseases. Likewise, the highest concentrations of this oncoprotein are found in patients with breast cancer, but lower concentrations  may be found in other malignancies, particularly ovarian, prostate and lung  cancer (mainly adenocarcinomas). HER-2/neu assay sensitivity in patients with, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of, Context: A novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of  beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with  architecture obeying those proteins' construction principles. The HMM is trained  and tested on a non-redundant set of 11 beta-barrel membrane proteins known to  date at atomic resolution with a jack-knife procedure. As a result, the method  correctly locates 97% of 172 transmembrane beta-strands. Out of the 11 proteins, the barrel size for ten proteins and the overall topology for seven proteins are  correctly predicted. Additionally, it successfully assigns the entire topology  for two new beta-barrel membrane proteins that have no significant sequence homology to the 11 proteins. Predicted topology for two candidates for  beta-barrel structure of the outer mitochondrial membrane is also presented in  the paper.","16800251, 22505536, 9744863, 11694782, 12798041",Her-2 belongs to the family of the human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs).,"16707458, 26545934, 15173008, 27993109, 30312728, 15920544, 21896992, 33202212, 11785652, 17536308, 15782071, 11694782, 22505536, 17867585, 12767812, 25620423, 27426127, 30384340, 10480346, 11180765, 19048033, 7612897, 21805036, 19279475, 29389942, 16800251, 18505086"

Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of  the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report  the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene.  The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar  to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261  amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular  mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human  glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human  tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in  primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys. Genomic Southern, Context: pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.  Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay  predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb  microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression  pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in  presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of  genetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members  support this hypothesis.

Up to 70% of Her2-positive breast cancers  demonstrate a response to Herceptin-based therapies, but resistance almost  inevitably arises within a year of the initial response. To help understand the  mechanism of Herceptin resistance, we isolated clonal variants of Her2-positive  BT474 human breast cancer cells (BT/Her(R)) that are highly resistant to  Herceptin. These cell lines exhibit sustained PI3K/Akt signaling as an essential  component of Herceptin-resistant proliferation. Several genes in the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling network have altered expression in BT/Her(R) cells,  including PPP1R1B, which encodes a 32 kDa protein known as Darpp-32 and its  amino-terminal truncated variant, t-Darpp. The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in Herceptin resistance. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We determined expression of Darpp-32 and t-Darpp in  BT/Her(R) cells selected for resistance to Herceptin.

Partial enzyme  deficiency results in gouty arthritis, while an almost complete deficiency leads  to the Lesch-Nyhan disease. The latter is characterized by severe neurological  dysfunction in addition to gouty arthritis, including retardation,  choreoathetosis and aggressive and compulsive self-mutilation. The biochemical  basis for the neurological symptoms is not understood. The human and mouse cDNA  (RNA copy) genes have been isolated and sequenced. In addition, the amino acid  sequence of the human protein has been directly determined. The human and mouse  proteins differ at 7 amino acids out of the total, (including the N terminal methionine, which is processed off during maturation) of 218. There are 42 out  of 654 nucleotide differences between the human and mouse genes in the amino  acid coding region. The mouse genomic structure has been determined. It has 9 exons and 8 introns with a total size of approximately 36 kb. The human gene is  very similar with identical intron-exon junction points and approximately the  same total gene size.

In rice and A. thaliana, most of the  CpG-rich clusters were associated with genes, which suggests that these clusters  are useful landmarks in genome sequences for identifying genes in plants with  small genomes. In contrast, in plants with larger genomes, only a few of the  clusters were associated with genes. These plant CpG-rich clusters satisfied the  criteria used for identifying human CpG islands, which suggests that these CpG  clusters may be regarded as plant CpG islands. The position of each island  relative to the 5'-end of its associated gene varied considerably. Genes in the analysed sequences were grouped into five classes according to the position of  the CpG islands within their associated genes. A large proportion of the genes  belonged to one of two classes, in which a CpG island occurred near the 5'-end of the gene or covered the whole gene region.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes, based on the context, BAX can trigger the release of cytochrome c. This is mentioned in the first and second contexts where it states that recombinant Bax was used to induce apoptosis and cyto","Context: DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris  torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the  antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the  growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO  induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial  pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and  induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9  and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release.

Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker.

This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context:  Bax induces mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis signals in mammalian cells.  However, the mechanism of how Bax is kept inactive is not fully elucidated.  Here, we identify FIH1 as a potential interactor of Bax through mass spectrometry analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments show  that FIH1 can directly interact with Bax. Bax-mediated apoptosis is suppressed  by FIH1 overexpression, but accelerated by FIH1 deficiency. FIH1 functions as a cytosol retention factor of Bax, blocking Bax translocation from cytosol to  mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. Overall, there results unveil a  novel role of FIH1 in the regulation of Bax-mediated apoptosis.","23567243, 23536162, 23536162, 23475110, 21069436","Yes, altered Bax conformation trigger its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria.

We found that median Granzyme B levels were significantly  different in patients with the GG genotype in the control group, compared to  those with the AA and AG genotype. However, this difference was not detected  between the control and endometriosis groups.What are the implications of these  findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our results contribute  to uncovering the pathogenesis of endometriosis since there are no previous  studies in the literature regarding this topic. Although we did not find a  difference, our results will inform further studies made on this topic. Studies with different molecules and an increased number of patients are needed. The  immune defect of endometriosis may not be due exclusively to Granzyme B. Other  mediators that are secreted from immune cells may have mutual effects and  interactions., Context: data has revealed strong candidates for the causal SNPs within these critical  regions; however, the molecular pathogenesis of these SNPs is currently unknown.  We used gene expression data collected from whole blood from 862 individuals and  endometrial tissue from 136 individuals from independent populations of European  descent to examine the mechanism underlying endometriosis susceptibility.  Association mapping results from 7,090 individuals (2,594 cases and 4,496  controls) supported rs3820282 as the SNP with the strongest association for  endometriosis risk (P = 1.84 × 10−5, OR = 1.244 (1.126-1.375)).

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in some cancers, including bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. In bladder cancer, its expression was significantly higher in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized","Context:  The MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is  misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long  nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique  loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of  splicing or gene expression. In lung cancer, MALAT1 does not alter alternative, Context:  INTRODUCTION: The functions of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have remained  elusive in many cases. Metastasis-Associated-in-Lung-Adenocarcinoma-Transcript-1  (MALAT-1) is an ncRNA that is highly expressed in several tumor types. METHODS: Overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches were used for the  analysis of the biological functions of MALAT-1 RNA. Tumor growth was studied in  nude mice. For prognostic analysis, MALAT-1 RNA was detected on paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue probes (n = 352)  using in situ hybridization. RESULTS: MALAT-1 was highly expressed in several human NSCLC cell lines. MALAT-1, Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (RTH).

To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3.

All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging.

Finally, mTOR  inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are  temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus., Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints. In light of disappointing clinical data with figitumumab and other targeted agents, it is likely that the use of  molecular markers will become important in predicting response to treatment.  This review outlines the role of IGF-1R signaling in solid tumors with a, Context: growth and metastasis. Thus, they represent attractive targets for cancer  therapy. This review will summarize current knowledge of the small-molecule  multiple-kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. These inhibitors generally  hinder the phosphorylation of several protein kinases of membrane receptors,  such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth  factor receptors, the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, and  cytoplasmic receptors such as c-Kit, Raf kinase, and FLT3.

In August 2006, the Neonatology Department at  Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, introduced total body cooling for infants born at  term with HIE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprises data from medical  records of newborn children born with HIE during a period of 32 months. Relevant  data for cooling were recorded. Structured neurological examinations were  carried out on survivors when they were ten and or 18 months old. RESULTS: A total of 32 infants fulfilled the criteria for cooling, the incidence being 0.4/1000 births. Twenty infants were cooled for 72 hours. Eleven infants  had cooling discontinued before 72 hours because of their grave prognosis. One  infant had cooling discontinued because of pulmonary hypertension. Most infants were cooled before six hours of age (median four hours). The mortality rate was  41%. A total of 45% were cooled without being placed in a ventilator.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,"Yes, telomerase is the enzyme targeted by the drug Imetelstat. This is explicitly stated in the context, where it mentions that Imetelstat is a potent and specific inhibitor of telomerase.","Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context:  Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity  for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the  potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results  showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner  in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed.  Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of  esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths., Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy., Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site., Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

What is the color of the protein Ranasmurfin?,The color of the Ranasmurfin protein is blue. This is explicitly stated in the context where it mentions that the crystals of the purified and crystallized Ranasmurfin protein are an intense blue color.,"Context: Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp lycopersici (Fol) is one of the  main diseases affecting tomatoes. The BHRS 2,3 genotype of tomato is, however,  resistant to this disease. A proteomic approach was used to understand the  defense mechanisms of this genotype using the tomato root, the first tissue that  interacts with the fungus, as a target. Protein was extracted and separated by  two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant  blue. The proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. A total  of 22 proteins were identified, 21 of which showed differential expression with  12 proteins being upregulated and nine being downregulated. Plants responded to the pathogen with increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. We  noted the induction of proteins involved in hypersensitivity reaction and other  defense mechanisms. The expression of proteins of primary metabolism related to energy production, however, decreased, as did the expression of two proteins  related to defense against abiotic stress.

The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Yes, the context provides information about two common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome. They are idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities.","Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 has an effect on chromatin. In the context, EZH2 is described as a histone methyltransferase that plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Additionally","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context:  PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival., Context: We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that  the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy, Context: non-PCSCs. The association between EZH2 function and PCSC growth was  investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Cell growth was  investigated by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis of PCSCs were explored by flow  cytometric analysis. Finally, the upstream pathway miRNA level was determined  via a luciferase reporter assay, and the downstream pathway cycle regulators  were examined via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results  showed that LNcap cell line comprised a greater proportion of CD44+/CD133+ cells  by comparison to the PC-3 cell line. EZH2 was up-regulated in PCSCs compared  with non-PCSCs. Silence of EZH2 inhibited cell growth and the cell cycle and promoted the progression of apoptosis. Furthermore, EZH2 was a direct target of  miR-101 in PCSCs and EZH2's mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-101  expression and cyclin E2 (a cell-cycle regulator) was suppressed by siEZH2. In conclusion, EZH2 is essential for PCSC growth, partly through a negative  regulation by miR-101 and positively regulating cyclin E2., Context: In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia  (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (Ezh2). Tumor cells show little residual H3K27 trimethylation marks compared  with controls. EZH2 is a component of the PRC2 Polycomb group protein complex,  which is associated with DNA methyltransferases. Using next-generation  sequencing, we identify alteration in gene expression levels of EZH2 and acquired mutations in PRC2-associated genes (DNMT3A and JARID2) in human adult  T-ALL.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study with rats, there is evidence that tomato juice can lower cholesterol levels. The study found that total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the group of rats","Context: blood samples were assayed for lipids, lipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive  protein, fibrinogen, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and creatinine.  A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

Other coronary biomarkers were unassociated  with tomato-based food products. In conclusion, women consuming ≥10 compared, Context: chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although  this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the  liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR., Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples.

When was vaxchora first licensed by the FDA?,"Yes, Vaxchora was first licensed by the FDA in June 2016. This is stated explicitly in the context given.","Context: efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally  downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus,  demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for  economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need., Context:  In October 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the first  serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine (MenB-FHbp [Trumenba, Wyeth  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) as a 3-dose series. In January 2015, FDA licensed a second MenB vaccine (MenB-4C [Bexsero, Novartis Vaccines]) as a 2-dose series.  Both vaccines were approved for use in persons aged 10-25 years. Following  outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on two college campuses in 2013, both MenB vaccines were granted Breakthrough Therapy designations, which  expedites drug development and review by FDA, and were licensed based on  accelerated approval regulations. On February 26, 2015, the Advisory Committee, Context: EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c,  FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body  weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop  diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60  ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side  effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin  offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable  side-effect profile. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency., Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to  these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections., Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents. Both  preclinical and clinical studies of this drug provide the significant protection  of hematopoietic progentitors from a broad range of cytotoxic agents such as  cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vinblastine, carboplatin, mitomycin-C, fotemustine,  doxorubicin, daunorubicin and radiation as well. Moreover, this drug can protect  other normal organs or tissues including kidney, salivary gland, liver, heart,  lung and small intestine. Amifostine is quite safe, the two major side effects  are vomiting and hypotension, and the minor effects are flushing, sneezing,  dizziness, chills, metallic taste etc. The drug was approved by the FDA of U.S.A. for use as a cytoprotectant in cyclophosphamide and cisplatin treatment  for advanced ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer.","27425792, 26068564, 23590413, 29018300, 10808697",Vaxchora was licensed by the FDA on June 10 2016.,27425792
What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, isradipine is indicated as an antihypertensive drug. This is evident from the context as it mentions that isradipine was used to treat black patients with essential hypertension and resulted in regression of left","Context: The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion  of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke. Since the lowering of blood, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications., Context: and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs,  respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A  subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again  after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance  arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem  isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio  (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and  meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography  according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as  monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from  131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in  both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g  with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was, Context: directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on  isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left  ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy was an effective antihypertensive drug in blacks with essential hypertension,  resulting in regression of left ventricular wall thickness and mass and  augmentation of fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass., Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner.","2150641, 15257873, 9544865, 2137344, 7738211",Isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients,"2137344, 11172743, 14727944, 15257873, 8963604, 12215829, 1363224, 10854683, 7848351, 9544865, 8466736, 7918132, 7955262, 10728516, 7946181, 7621840, 2949585, 8213473, 7738211, 7789292, 8205296, 2150641, 2523644, 7921533, 2523646"
Which genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development?,"Yes, several genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development. According to the context, RASSF1A gene inactivation through biallelic hypermethylation is a primary mechanism in medulloblast","Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development., Context:  Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain tumor, is thought to arise from  deregulated proliferation of cerebellar granule precursor (CGP) cells. Sonic  hedgehog (Shh) is the primary mitogen that regulates proliferation of CGP cells during the early stages of postnatal cerebellum development. Aberrant activation  of Shh signaling during this time has been associated with hyperplasia of CGP  cells and eventually may lead to the development of medulloblastoma. The molecular targets of Shh signaling involved in medulloblastoma formation are  still not well-understood. Here, we show that Shh regulates sustained activation  of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and that this activity is required for continued, Context: INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumor in  the pediatric population, accounting for 20-25% of all brain tumors in children.  Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in  medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation. PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of  family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed  their association with demographic and clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from  0.4 to 17 years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's  expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the, Context: genetic mechanisms play a role in the activation of PDGFR-RAS/MAPK signalling in  medulloblastoma, we performed a direct sequence analysis of the established  mutational ""hotspots"" of known targets of activating mutations within the  pathway (PDGFRA, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS and BRAF) and PDFRFB, in a cohort of 28  primary tumours. A synonymous sequence variation in PDGFRA (CCG to CCA; PRO 567  PRO) was detected in two cases (approximately 7%), but not in 150 normal  chromosomes assessed, suggesting that the PDGFRA locus may be associated with  medulloblastoma development in certain cases. No evidence for oncogenic  mutations affecting NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or PDFRFB was found in any case. These data demonstrate that activating mutations in established mutational  hotspots within the PDGFR-RAS/MAPK pathway are rare events in medulloblastoma  development, and suggest that alternative mechanisms are responsible for RAS/MAPK pathway activation in this disease., Context: medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in  developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of  hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation.

We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines. It also  attenuated MB cell migration, a pre-requirement for invasion. When used in  combination, LB100 enhanced cisplatin-mediated cytotoxic effects. Cell viability in the presence of 1 uM cisplatin alone was 61% (DAOY), 100% (D341), and 58%  (D283), but decreased with the addition of 2 μM of LB100 to 26% (DAOY), 67%  (D341), and 27% (D283), (p < 0.005). LB100 suppressed phosphorylation of the, Context: treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor  of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction  by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro. The antitumor effects of combining LB-100  with RT were verified in vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the  radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic  assays. LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by γ-H2AX), mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated  meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of  its downstream proteins. In vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the, Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the, Context: conserved small thioredoxin-like protein required for cell cycle progression.  The present work shows that SEPW1 facilitates the G1 to S-phase transition by  down-regulating expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. SEPW1  controls p21 by modulating levels of the p53 transcription factor, and this is  associated with changes in phosphorylation of Ser-33 in p53. More work is needed  to identify the mechanism by which SEPW1 regulates phosphorylation of Ser-33 and  the kinase or phosphatase enzymes involved., Context: potassium and sodium channels along the connecting and collecting tubules have  also been documented, WNK4 is typically believed to have little role in  modulating sodium chloride reabsorption along the thick ascending limb of the  loop of Henle. Yet wnk4-/- mice (knockout mice lacking WNK4) do not demonstrate  the hypocalciuria typical of pure distal convoluted tubule dysfunction. Here, we  tested the hypothesis that WNK4 also modulates bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl  cotransporter (NKCC2) function along the thick ascending limb. We confirmed that  w nk4-/- mice are hypokalemic and waste sodium chloride, but are also  normocalciuric. Results from Western blots suggested that the phosphorylated forms of both NCC and NKCC2 were in lower abundance in wnk4-/- mice than in  controls. This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Although  the initial response to furosemide was similar in wnk4-/- mice and controls, the response was lower in the knockout mice when reabsorption along the distal  convoluted tubule was inhibited.

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It has greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in ALK,"Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context: and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We  tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the  patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity  relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic  simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line  model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed  resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as  well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation  ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct  structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of  ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role  for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs., Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regulatory submissions have also been made in the EU and other countries. Phase III development is ongoing  worldwide to evaluate ceritinib both as a first- and second-line therapy for  ALK-positive NSCLC. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of, Context: BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma  kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib,  but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor  that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to  750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic  alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the  maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety,  pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in  ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during  treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The  maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic  events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase","24856155, 27707887, 25228534, 24980964, 24670165","Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.","24891360, 24675041, 24980964, 26018086, 25258279, 25381900, 25101329, 25258420, 24670165, 25228534, 25733882, 25170107, 25458559"
Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"No, the context does not provide details of a deep learning system that outperforms all human experts in detecting melanoma. The described CNN model has similar performance to some dermatologists but lower than the best-performing fusion algorithm","Context:  BACKGROUND: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate  melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger  groups of dermatologists are lacking. METHODS: Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture was trained and validated using  dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. In a comparative cross-sectional  reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were  sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and, Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating  characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean  receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71,  P = .001). LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy images with accuracy that exceeded some but not all dermatologists., Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and","29846502, 28026754, 29047032, 28969863, 29439500","in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a computational tool called SSCprofiler was used to predict novel miRNA precursors. It's based on a probabilistic method using Profile Hidden Markov Models and integrates sequence, structure, and conservation","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top  scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis., Context: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function to control gene expression.  These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth,  differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development  and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as  cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display  altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the  mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be  addressed. Moreover, the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted. Finally, the challenges regarding the translation of  research involving microRNAs to the clinical realm will be discussed., Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: evident, especially with the discovery that about 97% of the transcriptional  output in higher organisms are represented as noncoding RNAs: rRNA, snoRNAs,  tRNA, transposable elements, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, intergenic  regions and microRNAs. MicroRNAs function by negatively regulating gene  expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs and  thus participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular  processes including: development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and  apoptosis pathways. MicroRNA expression profiles in many types of cancers have  been identified. Recent reports have revealed that the expression profiles of microRNAs change in various human cancers and appear to function as oncogenes or  tumor suppressors. Abnormal microRNA expression has increasingly become a common  feature of human cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the involvement of microRNAs in different types of cancer and their potential  use as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers in the future.","21406606, 19324892, 20925959, 20221895, 23407615","SSCprofiler is a computational tool utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Yes, the VAC regimen for Ewing's sarcoma includes three drugs: vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide. These drugs are used in combination to treat patients with Ewing'","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Ewing's sarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumour occurring in children  and adolescents and exists in two different clinicopathological entities:  osseous Ewing's sarcoma (OES) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES). Five cases of primary epidural EES are described, which presented with non-specific  symptoms leading to a long diagnostic delay. The median age at diagnosis was 22  years (range 13-36 years). The median diagnostic delay was 3 months. All patients had one or more neurological deficits. All underwent surgical  exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant  radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine,, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients., Context:  To apply safely an aggressive chemotherapy regimen like CESS 81 requires  intensive supportive care. Bleomycin is evaluated as part of the protocol for  treatment of primary Ewing's sarcoma. Bleomycin might cause pulmonary fibrosis at higher cumulative doses as toxic effect directly to the lungs or most likely  in addition by the formation of vascular microthrombi. A randomized study is  designed to evaluate if pulmonary changes due to Bleomycin can be prevented using heparin.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,"Yes, Annexin V is an apoptotic marker because it binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells. This property can be used in various methods to detect and analyze apopt","Context: association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also  performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context: Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the  immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology.

METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells., Context: treated with 50 μM roscovitine to induce apoptosis. 6 h after roscovitine  treatment, cells were labeled with annexin V-Oregon green, harvested by  scraping, and labeled with PI.

These elements have been found to have diverse  functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The  evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems,  however, have not yet been determined. RESULTS: Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human.

Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved, Context: Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating  T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How  inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid  enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression in mouse ESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lef1  partially mimics the self-renewal-promoting effect of MEK inhibitors. Moreover,  depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs without exogenous factors, cytokines or inhibitors. Transcriptome  resequencing analysis reveals that LEF1 is closely associated with endoderm  specification in ESCs. Thus, our study adds support to the notion that the key to maintaining the ESC ground state is to shield ESCs from differentiative cues., Context: distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human.

Ultraconserved  elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster. CONCLUSION: We identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across  distant species.

We found that neural  progenitors depend increasingly on Bmi-1 for proliferation as development  proceeds from embryonic through adult stages. Acute shRNA-mediated Bmi-1  reduction causes defects in embryonic and adult NSC proliferation and  self-renewal that, unexpectedly, are mediated by a different cell-cycle  inhibitor, p21. Gene array analyses revealed developmental differences in  Bmi-1-controlled expression of genes in the p21-Rb cell cycle regulatory  pathway.

Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding. Medications such as ferrous sulfate, hydralazine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide  are thought to play a role as well.

FINDINGS: The efficacy and safety of linagliptin and empagliflozin as  monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs has been  established through extensive clinical trial programs. Studies specifically  evaluating the efficacy/safety of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor/sodium  glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in combination are limited, but do include  two studies of linagliptin/empagliflozin of up to 52 weeks in duration. These  studies show that the single-pill combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin produced clinical improvements in glycemic control that were generally superior  to the improvements seen with linagliptin and empagliflozin alone, but with a  safety profile comparable to that of the individual constituents.

Four types of single-agent drugs are in  late stage development, including (1) selective central cannabinoid-1 receptor  blockers, (2) selective central 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C serotonin receptor  agonists, (3) an intestinal lipase blocker, and (4) central-acting incretin  mimetic drugs. Four combination agent compounds in late stage development  include (1) Contrave, which combines long-acting versions of naltrexone and  bupropion; (2) Empatic, which combines long-acting bupropion and long-acting  zonisamide; (3) Qnexa, which combines phentermine with controlled release topiramate; and (4) an injectable combination of leptin and pramlintide. Peptide  YY and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor-1 antagonists are centrally acting  agents in early stage development.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is because cells with increased frequency of recombination have a higher chance of developing genetic alterations that can play a primary role in cancer development or be involved in","Context: and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an  elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context: cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments  utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive. The role  of repair proteins in the development of adaptive immunity by VDJ recombination,  antibody isotype class switching and affinity maturation by somatic  hypermutation has become clearer over the past few years, partly because of  identification of the genes involved in human disease. We describe the mechanisms involved in the development of adaptive immunity relating to DNA  repair, and the clinical consequences and treatment of the primary  immunodeficiency resulting from such defects., Context: expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients,  whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination  and carcinogenesis., Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP","12488587, 20298636, 12488587, 12427531, 23678008",Yes.

The Hippo pathway, which includes components like salv","Context: and one known mutation, in four out of four families and one out of five  sporadic cases. Highly variable phenotypes and a low penetrance with half of all  carriers being clinically asymptomatic were found in three families, whereas  affected members of one family showed almost identical phenotypes. However, an  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was not found. While HLXB9 mutations were  diagnosed in 23 patients, no mutation or microdeletion was detected in four  sporadic patients with Currarino syndrome. The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and  activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which  differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch, Context: Exploring the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration is one of the main  challenges in biology and biomedicine. Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway., Context: Structural and functional constraints are known to play a major role in  restricting the path of evolution of protein activities. However, constraints  acting on evolving transcriptional regulatory sequences, e.g. enhancers, are  largely unknown. Recently, we elucidated how a novel expression pattern of the  Neprilysin-1 (Nep1) gene in the optic lobe of Drosophila santomea evolved via  co-option of existing enhancer activities. Drosophila santomea, which has diverged from Drosophila yakuba by approximately 400 000 years has accumulated  four fixed mutations that each contribute to the full activity of this enhancer.  Recreating and testing the optic lobe enhancer of the ancestor of D. santomea and D. yakuba revealed that the strong D. santomea enhancer activity evolved  from a weak ancestral activity. Because each mutation on the path from the D.  yakuba/santomea ancestor to modern-day D. santomea contributes to the newly","11528505, 22101275, 17980593, 21338344, 24218638",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

What is the drug  gantenerumab targeting?,"Yes, gantenerumab targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. It is an investigational fully human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and remove beta-amy","Context: million people around the world. It is expected that the illness will affect  about 63 million people by 2030, and 114 million by 2050, worldwide. Current  Alzheimer's disease medications may ease symptoms for a time but are not capable  of slowing down disease progression. Indeed, all currently available therapies,  such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), are  primarily considered symptomatic therapies, although recent data also suggest  possible disease-modifying effects. Gantenerumab is an investigational fully  human anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody with a high capacity to bind and  remove beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. This compound, currently undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials represents a promising agent with a  disease-modifying potential in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview  of gantenerumab ranging from preclinical studies to human clinical trials., Context: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic  and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease  process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target  β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological  hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging  anti-Aβ drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs  in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the  β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of  cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in, Context: Since the innovation of epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analog, providing treatment  for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the 1990s, two types of oral drugs,  endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, have  further improved therapy for PAH. In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH., Context: The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors marked an important advancement in  the development of cancer therapeutics. Pembrolizumab is a selective humanized  IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits the programmed death-1 (PD-1)  receptor, an integral component of immune checkpoint regulation in the tumor  microenvironment. The drug is currently approved by the Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma and metastatic squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several published studies  demonstrate that single-agent pembrolizumab is safe and has efficacy in patients  with NSCLC. Many ongoing protocols are investigating the role of pembrolizumab in combination with other agents in lung cancer and various other cancer types.  We review the available data on pembrolizumab in NSCLC and examine the role of  potential predictive biomarkers of response to therapy., Context: medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome.

Pharmacological  therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in  Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are  promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing.","24255592, 27678025, 23068290, 26588948, 22397493","Gantenerumab significantly reduced amyloid plaques, cerebrospinal fluid total tau, and phospho-tau181 and attenuated increases of neurofilament light chain.","33336218, 34155411, 34198582"

Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities. We present a  model in which an alpha-independent beta-Kap progenitor gave rise to the  alpha-dependent beta-Kaps and the alpha-Kaps., Context: the merozoite, present either in the apical region (A-type) or in the cytosol  (B-type). The presence of RIFINs in merozoites suggests that antigenic variation  in P. falciparum is not only restricted to parasite-derived proteins at the IE  surface, but the phenomenon also prevails in other life cycle stages.  Interestingly, some RIFIN variants were detected only in intracellular stages  and not in merozoites, pointing to differential developmental expression  patterns for distinct members of this large protein family., Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF.

Twenty-eight patients, enrolled using a standard '3 + 3' dose escalation, received one or two (n = 3) cycles of lucatumumab 1·0,  3·0, 4·5 or 6·0 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. Common lucatumumab-related  adverse events were reversible, mild-to-moderate infusion reactions. Severe, Context: Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of  CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC). We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled  on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and  lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean  duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at  all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0  mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50, Context: The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial  pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated  with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and  bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab  was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have  previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,  preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the  binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques,  we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP  domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189, Context: Ibalizumab is a humanized, anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. It potently blocks  HIV-1 infection and targets an epitope in the second domain of CD4 without  interfering with immune functions mediated by interaction of CD4 with major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. We report here the crystal  structure of ibalizumab Fab fragment in complex with the first two domains  (D1-D2) of CD4 at 2.2 Å resolution. Ibalizumab grips CD4 primarily by the BC-loop (residues 121-125) of D2, sitting on the opposite side of gp120 and  MHC-II binding sites. No major conformational change in CD4 accompanies binding  to ibalizumab. Both monovalent and bivalent forms of ibalizumab effectively block viral infection, suggesting that it does not need to crosslink CD4 to  exert antiviral activity. While gp120-induced structural rearrangements in CD4  are probably minimal, CD4 structural rigidity is dispensable for ibalizumab","22475052, 22861192, 22475052, 28232034, 21134642","No, lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).",22475052

Smoking cessation rate showed no significant difference between the  treatment group (27.1%) and the control group (20.3%) at the end of treatment.  There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation., Context:  OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of acupuncture alone and in  combination with education on smoking cessation and cigarette consumption.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about three indications for bupropion. They are: 1. As an antidepressant - this was the original indication for which bupropion was developed. 2. As a tobacco use","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials,  bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile., Context: BACKGROUND: Bupropion has been available in the United States since 1989.  Initially a thrice-daily immediate-release formulation, a twice-daily  sustained-release formulation followed in 1996, and, in August 2003, a  once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.

Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy, Context: significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo only to 6 months.  However, point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher with  bupropion than placebo to 18 months. Bupropion 300 mg/day recipients reported  nicotine withdrawal symptoms during treatment; however, the symptoms were  significantly less severe with bupropion than placebo. Patients receiving  bupropion 300 mg/day or bupropion in combination with nicotine patch for smoking  cessation generally gained less bodyweight than placebo recipients. The benefits  of bupropion for preventing weight gain persisted after the completion of long  term, but not short term therapy. Bupropion was well tolerated in clinical trials, and the only adverse events that were significantly more common with  bupropion than placebo were insomnia and dry mouth. Data published so far  suggest that sustained release bupropion has a low potential for inducing seizures (seizure rate approximately 0.1% in patients with depression).

MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration.

Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy. METHODS: In a sample of 118 Scandinavian patients with treatment-resistant  depression who are naive to MAOI therapy, we investigated the associations  between a common MAOA functional promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR),, Context: METHODS: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the  influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and  diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals:  20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate  that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD., Context: impact on the understanding of the nature of constitutional factors making  individuals vulnerable for e.g. substance abuse and the link between low  platelet MAO activity and type 2 alcoholism, recently confirmed on non-human  primates, is discussed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the association  between platelet MAO and behaviour are discussed and evidence that common  transcriptional factors, e.g. within the AP-2 family, regulating both the  expression of platelet MAO and components of central monoaminergic systems, such  as synthetizing enzymes, receptors and transporters, are presented. A hypothesis  is put forward, that such common transcription factors may not directly regulate platelet MAO expression, but rather mitochondrial number or outer membrane  surface., Context: Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. They can stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome, making them attractive delivery vehicles for persistent transgene expression. Both simple retroviral vectors and lentiviral vectors","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for, Context:  Extensive gene therapy studies in preclinical models and in clinical trials  underscore the relative safety of onco-retroviral vectors. Up until recently, no  adverse effects have been reported in nearly 2000 patients that were enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials involving onco-retroviral vectors. However, the  main safety concern of using onco-retroviral vectors is related to the risk of  malignant transformation following oncogene activation due to random onco-retroviral genomic integration. Based on primate studies, there is an  apparent low risk of malignancy that is predominately associated with the  occurrence of chronic retroviremia resulting from replication-competent, Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase  cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity.

Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production. Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated.","24120896, 16251873, 12686720, 23921576, 15912200, 23843498, 23884859, 19435468, 23845071, 23860311, 23845947, 23845948, 21943326"

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No, tumour specific antigens are not always originating from known protein coding genes. They can also emerge de novo from ancestral non-coding DNAs as recent findings suggest. This is a new way of gene origination","Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,, Context:  Tinkering with pre-existing genes has long been known as a major way to create  new genes. Recently, however, motherless protein-coding genes have been found to  have emerged de novo from ancestral non-coding DNAs. How these genes originated is not well addressed to date. Here we identified 24 hominoid-specific de novo  protein-coding genes with precise origination timing in vertebrate phylogeny.  Strand-specific RNA-Seq analyses were performed in five rhesus macaque tissues (liver, prefrontal cortex, skeletal muscle, adipose, and testis), which were  then integrated with public transcriptome data from human, chimpanzee, and  rhesus macaque. On the basis of comparing the RNA expression profiles in the, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.

So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with","28536100, 23028352, 11599633, 11599633, 1423320","Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the tissue of origin of the HSP.

Which gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome?,"Yes, the TWIST gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This gene is located on chromosome 7p21.2 and its mutations are responsible for the condition in about 80","Context: additional malformations and without chromosome breakage, who fits this narrow  definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation  in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the  protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further  evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation  is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular  importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk  for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance.  Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation,  while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is  very low., Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a relatively common craniosynostosis disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified  in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The TWIST gene product is a  transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains. Numerous  missense and nonsense mutations cluster in the functional domains, without any  apparent mutational hot spot. Two novel point mutations and one novel polymorphism are included in this review. Large deletions including the TWIST  gene have been identified in some patients with learning disabilities or mental  retardation, which are not typically part of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Comprehensive studies in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome have demonstrated a TWIST gene abnormality in about 80%, up to 37% of  which may be large deletions [Johnson et al., 1998]. The gene deletions and, Context: The authors describe on a Brazilian girl with coronal synostosis, facial  asymmetry, ptosis, brachydactyly, significant learning difficulties, recurrent  scalp infections with marked hair loss, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E.  Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in  7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex  Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with  phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four  other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of  six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31. Our case reinforces FERD3L as candidate gene for intellectual disability and  suggested that genes located in 3p21.3 can be related to hyper IgE phenotype., Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome  7p21.2. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a  new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears  to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as  a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome.

The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented.

Our empirical analysis shows that the method yields  reproducible results across experiments, and is able to detect functional  important changes in histone modifications. To further explore the broader  applicability of MMDiff, we apply it to two ENCODE data sets: one investigating  the histone modification H3K27ac and one measuring the genome-wide binding of  the transcription factor CTCF. In both cases, MMDiff proves to be complementary  to count-based methods. In addition, we can show that MMDiff is capable of  directly detecting changes of homotypic binding events at neighbouring binding  sites. MMDiff is readily available as a Bioconductor package. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that higher order features of ChIP-Seq  peaks carry relevant and often complementary information to total counts, and  hence are important in assessing differential histone modifications and transcription factor binding. We have developed a new computational method,  MMDiff, that is capable of exploring these features and therefore closes an  existing gap in the analysis of ChIP-Seq data sets., Context: sources.

CONCLUSION(S): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an  IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Proceeding directly to controlled  ovarian hyperstimulation in women with asymptomatic ovarian endometriomas might  reduce the time to pregnancy, the costs of treatment, and the hypothetical  complications of laparoscopic surgery. Conversely, conservative surgical  treatment of ovarian endometriomas in symptomatic women does not impair IVF or  intracytoplasmic sperm injection success rates., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs.  PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery. INTERVENTION(S): Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Response to gonadotropins, fertilization, implantation,  and pregnancy rates.

May be difficult to diagnose  and may cause significant complications at any stage during gestation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The author presents 2 cases of ovarian endometriomas  diagnosed and treated surgically in 14 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course., Context: natural pregnancy rate in the control group. Pregnancy rates in patients  receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15)  before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively. In post-menopausal women, the  median (quartile) age at menopause was similar in the study (n=9) and control  groups (n=6) [48 (45-52) versus 49 (44-52) years, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced  long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no  contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve  the success rates of fertility treatment.","15136074, 15136074, 15136074, 11526777, 24231199","Yes, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.","12419041, 15136074, 17399914, 23759693, 21561807, 8737616, 16034960, 7202738, 21679474, 18425908, 21764126, 2943896, 11526777, 22695290, 23277022, 24231199"
Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab. Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody","Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides. Two types of covalent complexes were found; the peptides are  either linked via a thioester bond to the active site cysteine of TG2 or via, Context: BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterised by low  cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol, increased plasma LDL cholesterol  concentrations, and premature cardiovascular disease. Despite intensive statin  therapy, with or without ezetimibe, many patients are unable to achieve  recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol. We investigated the effect of  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with  this disorder.  METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  was undertaken at 39 sites (most of which were specialised lipid clinics, mainly  attached to academic institutions) in Australia, Asia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South Africa between Feb 7 and Dec 19, 2013. 331 eligible  patients (18-80 years of age), who met clinical criteria for heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolaemia and were on stable lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks, with a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration of 2·6 mmol/L or  higher, were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous  evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks, evolocumab 420 mg monthly, or subcutaneous, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site., Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus  formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and  adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not","14747475, 25282519, 24661068, 8798387, 23376345",Evolocumab (AMG145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that demonstrated marked reductions in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in statin-intolerant patients.,"24859266, 24694531, 24662398, 24691094, 25470376, 24825642, 24953393, 25079474, 24953396, 25002170, 24678979, 24598985, 24661068, 24477778, 24481874, 24255061, 25282519, 25282520, 24509273, 25052769, 24284914, 24373748, 24961142, 25410046"

The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A→I) that is catalyzed by the members of the  Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are  identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a  method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate  RNA-seq data has not been published so far. Even more surprising,, Context: The advent of deep sequencing technologies has greatly improved the study of  complex eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes, providing the unique opportunity  to investigate posttranscriptional molecular mechanisms as alternative splicing  and RNA editing at single base-pair resolution. RNA editing by adenosine  deamination (A-to-I) is widespread in humans and can lead to a variety of  biological effects depending on the RNA type or the RNA region involved in the  editing modification. Hereafter, we describe an easy and reproducible  computational protocol for the identification of candidate RNA editing sites in  human using deep transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and genome (DNA-Seq) sequencing data.","24163250, 24163250, 24163250, 28049429, 25577380","RADAR is a rigorously annotated database of A-to-I RNA editing.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA1 include FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, GATA-2, SUZ12, and E","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes., Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction. GATA3 may, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization.","12032775, 18844071, 16888367, 21632975, 28161276","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"
Which proteins does RG-7992 target?,"No, the context does not provide information about which proteins RG-7992 targets.","Context: disadvantage of traditional IP and co-IP is that the conditions used to elute  the precipitated antigen also release the antibody thus contaminating the  antigen and destroying the antibody support. To overcome these problems, we  describe two methods to generate a reusable antibody support by cross-linking  the antibody to immobilized Protein A or Protein G, or by coupling it directly  to the resin (see Scheme 1). Antibody cross-linking can be done in 1 h while  antibody coupling requires 4 h. IP or co-IP is accomplished by incubating the  antibody resin with the protein sample. Washes and elutions are carried out in a  spin column to reduce resin loss and decrease assay time. Target proteins are eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.8) and the resin-bound antibody is  re-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for reuse. Our studies have  demonstrated that the immobilization efficiency for the antibody coupling method was similar for several species of antibody. Furthermore, we illustrate that  using both methods of antibody immobilization yield IP and co-IP results similar  to traditional protocols but eliminate the antibody heavy and light chain  contamination., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: biomarker investigation. We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context: damage, mediates the monoubiquitylation of the FA protein FANCD2.  Monoubiquitylated FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with proteins involved in  DNA repair, including BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and RAD51. All these  factors are required for cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. The  inactivation of the FA pathway has also been observed in a wide variety of human  cancers and is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA crosslinking  agents. Drugs that inhibit the FA pathway may be useful chemosensitizers in the  treatment of cancer. Publication history: Republished from Current BioData's  Targeted Proteins database (TPdb; http://www.targetedproteinsdb.com)., Context: Upon stress, cytoplasmic mRNA is sequestered to insoluble ribonucleoprotein  (RNP) granules, such as the stress granule (SG). Partially due to the belief  that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk,  stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly  characterized. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress targets  only a small subset of translationally suppressed mRNAs into the insoluble RNP  granule fraction (RG). This subset, characterized by extended length and  adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for  cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct  responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific  RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified. Previously underappreciated, transcriptome  profiling in the RG may contribute to understanding human diseases associated  with RNP dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.","12915006, 30194269, 22015969, 18047734, 29576526",BFKB8488A is a bispecific antibody against FGFR1 and KLB.,33139537

Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?,"Yes, ficolin-3 activates the lectin complement pathway. This is stated explicitly in the context as Ficolin-3 is described as a ""recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway.""","Context: proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were  investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly  expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung  as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of  Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung  among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed  higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1  and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different  from the other ficolins and MBL.

Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high  complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic  resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators., Context: Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway  and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two  nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway  activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the  circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is  unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the  measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal  antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the  extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97  healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found, Context: (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were  all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to  SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that  Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore,  Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease  activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption  in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration., Context: Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition  molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic  variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene  was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms  was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by  production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied  10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml).

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not provide information about any resource developed for studying the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. The context discusses the importance of testing antibody specificity when studying the expression of the GABARAP","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that, Context: stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: Enlargement) is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial with blinded  end-points. Treatment with losartan will be compared with no additional  treatment after 3 years of follow-up. We will enroll 330 patients with MFS who  will be randomly assigned to receive losartan or not. Patients taking  beta-blockers will continue taking their standard treatment. The primary  end-point is the largest change in aortic diameter at any aortic level measured  by means of MRI. Secondary end-points are change in mortality, incidence of  dissection, elective aortic surgery, aortic volume, aortic stiffness and  ventricular function. We will also investigate gene and protein expression change in the skin under losartan therapy and create prediction models for  losartan-treatment response and aortic dilatation. DISCUSSION: The COMPARE study will provide important evidence of effects of losartan treatment in adult Marfan patient population. We expect losartan to  significantly reduce the occurrence and progression of aortic dilatation. This  trial investigates a wide spectrum of clinical, genetic and biochemical effects, Context: the specificity of three antibodies targeted against different peptide sequences  within GABARAPL1: CHEM-CENT (an antibody raised against a short peptide sequence  within the center of the protein), PTG-NTER (an antibody raised against the  N-terminus of the protein) and PTG-FL (an antibody raised against the  full-length protein). The results described in this article demonstrate the  importance of testing antibody specificity under the conditions for which it  will be used experimentally, a caution that should be taken when studying the  expression of the GABARAP family proteins., Context: directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to  1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.  Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible  genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among  them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6.","30214018, 25591463, 20067609, 21862879, 21536806",Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines is a data and tool resource to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.,27710791
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that ""large PABP1-positive cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. PCOS  model rats were established by dehydroepiandrosterone injection. Enzyme‑linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured serum sex hormones. Hematoxylin and eosin  (H&E) staining was used to examine histological changes of the ovarian tissues.  The expression levels of FKBP52 were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC)  staining, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR)  analysis and western blotting (WB). In addition, RT‑qPCR analysis was used to  detect the mRNA expression of AR, and WB was used to detect the protein  expression levels of AR, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated (p‑)ERK1/2. In granulosa cell (GC) experiments, primary GCs were extracted and cultured. FKBP4 is the  FKBP52‑encoding gene, therefore, adenovirus vectors Ad‑Oe‑FKBP4‑EGFP and  Ad‑siRNA‑FKBP4‑EGFP were constructed to examine the association among the above factors using the RT‑qPCR and WB methods.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF.

Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"Yes, according to the context, the yeast protein Abf1 can act as an insulator. This is stated explicitly in the context when it mentions that ""insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory","Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead  operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes,, Context: biogenesis (Ribi) gene promoters dynamically responds to changes in growth  conditions. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors  as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active  promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within  the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and  stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. Moreover, the frequent presence of  Abf1 binding sites in the promoters of mitochondrial RP genes evokes the  possibility that Abf1 might orchestrate still unexplored levels of co-regulation  involving growth-related gene networks in yeast cells., Context: described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains., Context: Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously  described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity.

Which viruses are best known to cause myocarditis?,"Yes, based on the context, enteroviruses are best known to cause myocarditis. This is stated in the first sentence of the context where it mentions that ""Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause","Context:  Enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute  myocarditis and possible consequence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle., Context: INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation  of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy was  identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to  H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our  knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H1N1 with  myocarditis in pregnancy.  CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29  and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory  manifestations of H1N1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if  myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of, Context: The results are presented of serological tests by the neutralization method for  antigens of Coxsackie B group, and by the haemagglutination inhibition method  for three types of parainfluenza and sporadic influenza virus in 529 patients  with myocarditis. In 7 cases the virus was isolated from stools. Virus aetiology  of the disease was confirmed in 23.4% of cases, on average. Raised levels of  antibodies to Coxsackie B antigens were found more frequently than the levels of antibodies to parainfluenza viruses. Seroconversion was more frequent in  infections by parainfluenza type 3 than type 2. During an influenza epidemic in  5 cases raised levels of antibodies to the epidemic-causing strain were  observed., Context: The diagnosis of myocarditis can be challenging given that symptoms, clinical  exam findings, electrocardiogram results, biomarkers, and echocardiogram results  are often non-specific. Endocardial biopsy is an established method for  diagnosing myocarditis, but carries the risk of complications and false negative  results. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the primary  non-invasive imaging tool in patients with suspected myocarditis. Myocarditis can be diagnosed by using three tissue markers including edema,  hyperemia/capillary leak, and necrosis/fibrosis. The interpretation of cardiac  MR findings can be confusing, especially when the myocardium is diffusely involved. Using T1 and T2 maps, the diagnosis of myocarditis can be made even in  cases of global myocarditis with the help of quantitative analysis. We herein  describe a case of acute global myocarditis which was diagnosed by using, Context:  The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE.

METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy, Context:  Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur.

Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of  cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia., Context: Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may  interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. However, the  literature on this issue is conflicting. In investigating the relationship  between pregnancy-associated complications and the presence of thrombophilia  risk factors, we studied the records of 414 women who had been examined for  inherited and acquired thrombophilia in the period 1996 to 2006 because of pregnancy-associated complications. Of a total of 885 pregnancies among the  women, 397 were recorded as foetal loss/intrauterine foetal death during the  first (62 %), second (25 %) or third trimester (13 %).

Intrauterine growth  restriction was found in 105 (25 %) of the women, and 29 (7 %) suffered, Context: BACKGROUND: Although some paternal components to the predisposition to  pre-eclampsia have been demonstrated recently, it is not known whether such  paternal factors play a role to thrombophilia-related perinatal mortality.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the paternal and maternal contribution to perinatal  mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Data from a prospective registry of perinatal mortality in a Dutch  healthcare region were used. Between December 1999 and May 2000, the prevalence  of thrombophilia was studied in 74 women with a history of perinatal mortality  (female cases) and 54 of their male partners (male cases). Seventy-one healthy  unrelated women after uneventful pregnancies only and 66 of their male partners were used as controls.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the context provided, it is mentioned to have potential neuroprotective effects against 3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifest","Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases., Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats.","22383310, 22850463, 16964766, 24205431, 24211676",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"

The  purpose of this study was to assess whether PGI(2) analogues could affect T  helper (Th) cell responses in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy  donors (HD). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33  patients with SSc and 29 HD. Cytokine levels in PBMC and monocyte/CD4 T cell  cultures were quantified by immunoassays. The frequencies of interleukin  (IL)-17A, IL-22, interferon γ (IFNγ) and IL-4-producing CD4 T cells were  assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Selective receptor antagonists, cytokine blocking antibodies and signalling protein inhibitors were used to  identify the receptors and signalling pathways mediating PGI(2) analogue  effects. RESULTS: Th17 and Th22 cells were more abundant in individuals with SSc than in HD. PGI(2) analogues (iloprost, treprostinil and beraprost) significantly  increased IL-17A and IL-22 in vitro while decreasing IFNγ production both in SSc  and HD PBMC.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are intermediate products formed during the metabolism of certain drugs. They can bind covalently to cellular proteins, leading to immune-mediated toxicity in some cases. However, not all reactive","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context: The decline in approval of new drugs during the past decade has led to a close  analysis of the drug discovery process. One of the main reasons for attrition is  preclinical toxicity, frequently attributed to the generation of  protein-reactive drug metabolites. In this review, we present a critique of such  reactive metabolites and evaluate the evidence linking them to observed toxic  effects. Methodology for the characterization of reactive metabolites has advanced greatly in recent years, and is summarized first. Next, we consider the  inhibition of key metabolic enzymes by electrophilic metabolites, as well as  unfavorable drug-drug interactions that may ensue. One important class of protein-reactive metabolites, not linked conclusively to a toxic event, is acyl  glucuronides. Their properties are discussed in light of the safety  characteristics of carboxylic acid containing drugs. Many adverse drug reactions, Context:  Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug  reactions. It is often assumed that if a reactive metabolite is found, it must  be responsible for the idiosyncratic reactions associated with that drug. However, the evidence linking reactive metabolites and idiosyncratic reactions  is circumstantial at best, and in many cases we have virtually no evidence.  Furthermore, it is common for a drug to form several reactive metabolites, so it can be difficult to determine which, if any, is responsible for a given  idiosyncratic reaction. Although the reactive metabolite hypothesis is logical,  it has important implications for drug development, and we need to develop ways, Context: mechanism. Because most reactive metabolites are not stable, it is difficult to  detect them directly. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping  reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable.  However, it is challenging to ""fish"" these adducts out from a complex biological  matrix, especially for adducts generated via uncommon metabolic pathways. In  this regard, we developed a novel approach based upon metabolomic technologies  to screen trapped reactive metabolites. The bioactivation of pulegone,  acetaminophen, and clozapine were reexamined by using this metabolomic approach.  In all these cases, a large number of trapped reactive metabolites were readily identified. These data indicate that this metabolomic approach is an efficient  tool to profile xenobiotic bioactivation.","12093356, 16967439, 23090860, 17145699, 21469730","Reactive metabolites are generated when a small molecule, commonly a drug or hydrocarbon, is broken down in the body.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the Triple A syndrome is characterized by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. Additionally, most patients also develop neurolog","Context: BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal  insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various  progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in  association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS  gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of  the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be  established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents  and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome  demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of, Context: The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is  characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal  insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and  dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies  the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of  associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been  previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by  molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The, Context: ""Triple A"" syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive condition whose main clinical  features are alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal failure. Most patients also  develop some neurologic abnormalities. We describe an 11-year-old boy with  triple A syndrome who presented with progressive axonal motor neuropathy.  Molecular analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the AAAS gene,  confirming the clinical diagnosis. The clinical presentation of patients with  triple A syndrome is variable. Our patient manifested neurologic problems during  early childhood, before other features of this condition were apparent. We  highlight the neurologic presentation of this multisystem disorder. In the presence of complex axonal neuropathy, other features of this condition should  be sought., Context: The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the  syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and  molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis. In one patient with isolated achalasia, the diagnosis of triple A syndrome could only be made on the basis of  the molecular genetic analysis of the AAAS gene. We therefore suggest that the  diagnosis of triple A syndrome should be considered in patients who exhibit only one or two of the main symptoms (i.e. alacrima, achalasia or adrenal  insufficiency). These patients require careful neurological investigation, and  mutation analysis of the AAAS gene should be performed., Context: diagnosis is often difficult in all but the classical presentation. The  inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family  history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus  on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at  this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from  North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one  Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these  changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract. Those bearing mutations had the classical  triple A syndrome of achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a  progressive neurological syndrome.

CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p.

Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation  studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics.  Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was conducted on one CANTAB and one polysomnography parameter of interest. CEP-26401  was slowly absorbed (median tmax range 3-6 hours) and the mean terminal  elimination half-life ranged from 24-60 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose-  and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major  elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep,, Context:  CEP-26401 is a novel orally active, brain-penetrant, high-affinity histamine H3  receptor (H3R) antagonist, with potential therapeutic utility in cognition  enhancement. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was, Context: H3 receptors by selective H3 receptor antagonists has been shown to enhance the  release of neurotransmitters such as histamine, ACh, dopamine and  norepinephrine, among others, which play important roles in cognitive processes.  The cognitive-enhancing effects of H3 antagonists across multiple cognitive  domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also bolster confidence  in this therapeutic approach for the treatment of attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, although  a number of clinical studies examining the efficacy of H3 receptor antagonists  for a variety of cognitive disorders are currently underway, no clinical proof of concept for an H3 receptor antagonist has been reported to date. The  discovery of effective H3 antagonists as therapeutic agents for the novel  treatment of cognitive disorders will only be accomplished through continued research efforts that further our insights into the functions of the H3  receptor., Context: with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose  CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement.","22001260, 27222271, 27222271, 18469850, 27222271",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
Which organs are mostly affected in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"Yes, the heart is one of the organs frequently affected in SLE. The skin, kidneys, hematologic system, mucocutaneous system, musculoskeletal system, and neuropsychiatric systems are","Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate. Among the  severe potential fatal complications are those of the central and peripheral nervous system which usually develop during the course of the disease and very  rarely from the outset of the disease. We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with, Context:  BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic  disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus  erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the  diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score ≥ 10, Context:  Lupus erythematosus (LE) includes a broad spectrum of diseases from a  cutaneous-limited type to a systemic type. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  a systemic autoimmune disease which affects multiple organs. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes skin symptoms seen in SLE and cutaneous-limited LE.  Although immune abnormalities, as well as heritable, hormonal and environmental  factors, are involved in the pathology of LE, the actual pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, the involvement of various cytokines has been shown in the  pathogenesis of LE. Moreover, some trials with biological agents targeted  specific cytokines are also ongoing for SLE. In this article, we review the, Context:  The heart is one of the most frequently affected organs in SLE. Any part of the  heart can be affected, including the pericardium, myocardium, coronary arteries,  valves, and the conduction system. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, a high incidence of CAD has become increasingly recognized as a cause of  mortality, especially in older adult patients and those with long-standing SLE.  Many unanswered questions remain in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac manifestations of SLE. It is not currently possible to predict the  patients who are at greatest risk for the various types of cardiac involvement.  However, with the rapid advancement of basic science and translational research, Context: distended gallbladder with thickened wall, pericholecystic fluid and absence of  gallstones. Results Among the 8411 hospitalized SLE patients in PUMCH, 13  (0.15%) were identified to have SLE-AAC. Eleven (84.6%) of them were female,  with a mean age of 30.1 ± 8.6 years. AAC was the initial manifestation of SLE in  four (30.8%) cases. Eleven (84.6%) patients complained of fever and abdominal  pain, four (30.8%) had positive Murphy's sign and six (46.2%) had elevated liver  enzymes. The median SLE Disease Activity Index was 8.0 (range 0-20.0) at the  time of AAC. Other affected organs in SLE-AAC included kidney (11, 84.6%) and  hematologic system (11, 84.6%), followed by mucocutaneous (seven, 53.8%), musculoskeletal (seven, 53.8%) and neuropsychiatric (two, 15.4%) systems. All  patients received treatment of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants but none  underwent surgical intervention. During a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-320 months), 12 cases (92.4%) responded to treatment with no relapse and one  patient (7.6%) died of septic shock. Conclusion Our study suggests that AAC is a  relatively uncommon and underestimated gastrointestinal involvement of SLE that","26366317, 25186992, 21767292, 24268009, 28355987","In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), brain and kidney are the most frequently affected organs.
