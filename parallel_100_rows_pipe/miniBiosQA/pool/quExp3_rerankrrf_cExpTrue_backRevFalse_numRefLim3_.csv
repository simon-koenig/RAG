What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Post-translational modification of histone proteins, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Restoration of expression of genes","Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9).

Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the, Context: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Pediatric high-grade  glioma (HGG) accounts for ∼8-12 % of these brain tumors and is a devastating  disease as 70-90 % of patients die within 2 years of diagnosis. The failure to  advance therapy for these children over the last 30 years is largely due to  limited knowledge of the molecular basis for these tumors and a lack of disease  models. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic  pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying  either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Although mutations in many chromatin modifiers have been identified in cancer, this was the first demonstration that histone  mutations may be drivers of disease. Subsequent studies have identified  high-frequency mutation of histone H3 to K36M in chondroblastomas and to G34W/L","19270706, 19270706, 25773741","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2. These lncRNAs contain consensus Sam68 binding sites and their stability is affected by the loss of Sam68.","Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes.

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model.,"Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions  using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA  secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that  RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing  programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease characterized  by the presence of nucleic acid- and protein-targeting autoantibodies and an  aberrant type I IFN expression signature. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an  autosomal-recessive encephalopathy in children that is characterized by  mutations in numerous nucleic acid repair enzymes and elevated IFN levels.  Phenotypically, patients with AGS and SLE share many similarities. Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) is a nucleic acid repair enzyme that removes unwanted  ribonucleotides from DNA. In this issue of the JCI, Günther and colleagues  provide an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between defective removal of ribonucleotides in AGS and SLE, and these findings will  likely serve as a strong springboard to provide novel therapeutic inroads","28459942, 22544737, 25500879","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This is achieved through Fluorescence In","Context: A host of observations demonstrating the relationship between nuclear  architecture and processes such as gene expression have led to a number of new  technologies for interrogating chromosome positioning. Whereas some of these  technologies reconstruct intermolecular interactions, others have enhanced our  ability to visualize chromosomes in situ. Here, we describe an oligonucleotide-  and PCR-based strategy for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform that enables this technology to be extended to any  organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are  renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers  precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and  multicolor imaging of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with, Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,PR-Set7 deposits monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1).,"Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes, Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions","27131378, 19687145, 24681537",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,Yes. The context mentions that avelumab is among the recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma.,"Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma. Yet the challenge for clinicians is to  determine the optimal choice of agents as first-line or second-line therapy and  which offers the best chance for overall survival for the individual patient in this rapidly changing field, Context: This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN  Guidelines) for Bladder Cancer focuses on systemic therapy for muscle-invasive  urothelial bladder cancer, as substantial revisions were made in the 2017  updates, such as new recommendations for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab,  durvalumab, and avelumab.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,"The epidermal growth factor family.   This is mentioned in the context as ""HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors.""","Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation.

These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the, Context: understanding the key interactions necessary to engage BAK and BAX activation,  MOMP, and apoptosis. Furthermore, it is possible to biochemically define the  relationships between BCL-2 family function and mitochondrial physiology using  isolated systems.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,Yes. MALAT-1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and promotes tumor formation and growth.,"Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the TR beta gene, but does not mention any involvement of thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations.","Context:  The thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are disorders in which the body's  tissues are resistant to the effects of thyroid hormone. Generalized resistance  to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland and in most or all of the peripheral tissues. Affected individuals have elevated  serum thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) but are usually clinically euthyroid and require no treatment. Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH)  is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland but not in peripheral  tissues. Patients have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and normal or, Context: Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear  thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are  transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression.  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in  the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating  levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This  ""inappropriate"" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism,  where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually present with goiter and an euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid metabolic state.  Thus, pituitary resistance results in hypersecretion of TSH, which compensates,  at least in part, for hormone resistance in peripheral tissues. Despite this, Context:  Thyroid diseases are the commonest endocrine disorders in the general  population. In most of the cases, they are consistent with benign conditions  which may be asymptomatic or affect people at a variable extent. Since they often represent chronic conditions their prevalence increases by age and reaches  in elderly the highest rates. Thyroid nodules are a common clinical finding.  Most subjects with thyroid nodules have few or no symptoms. Thyroid nodules are more commonly non-functioning. However, in elderly, toxic multinodular goiter is  the most frequent cause of spontaneous hyperthyroidism and often, it emerges  insidiously from nontoxic multinodular goiter.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,Interleukin-17a receptor.,"Context: Targeted therapies are widely used in cancer because of their effectiveness,  even in tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy such as kidney  or hepatocellular carcinomas. There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib. Inhibitors of KIT, a membrane receptor, are mainly represented by imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Finally, mTOR  inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are  temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus, Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab  (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either  trial would meet their primary endpoints. In light of disappointing clinical data with figitumumab and other targeted agents, it is likely that the use of  molecular markers will become important in predicting response to treatment.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,Telomerase.   Imetelstat binds with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic activity.,"Context: division, most human cancer cells typically express high levels of telomerase  and show unlimited cell proliferation. High telomerase expression allows cells  to proliferate and expand long-term and therefore supports tumor growth. Owing  to the high expression and its role, telomerase has become an attractive  diagnostic and therapeutic cancer target. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and  specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical  trials. Here, we report on the structure and the mechanism of action of  imetelstat as well as about the preclinical and clinical data and future  prospects using imetelstat in cancer therapy, Context: PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate  oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase. It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2). Pharmacokinetics is dose  dependent with a lower clearance at the highest dose level. Telomerase, Context: and cell proliferation were assessed. The efficacy of imetelstat in vivo was  evaluated in subcutaneous xenografts derived from each of the cell lines.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked  telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as  measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and  phosphorylation of TP53. Imetelstat-treated G401 cells underwent complete growth  arrest after 16 passages. The other two cell lines exhibited growth inhibition.  Imetelstat resulted in 40-50% growth inhibition compared to placebo-treated  controls in all three xenograft models.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.","Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression.

For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P = .68) but lower than  the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating  characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean  receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71,  P = .001). LIMITATIONS: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in  clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not  provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained  using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy images with accuracy that exceeded some but not all dermatologists, Context:  Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in  dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the  accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between  melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of  skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address  three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e.,  lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and","29047032, 28969863, 29439500","in August of 2018 a study was published where a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) diagnostic performance was compared with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: A randomized study of 264 children and adults with previously untreated  localized Ewing's sarcoma of bone was undertaken between 1973 and 1978 by 83  institutions of three national study groups: Children's Cancer Study Group,  Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The Intergroup Study  was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral  pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide  (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and  metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival  rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of  disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC  plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to treatment with VAC alone. The addition of ADR or bilateral pulmonary RT to VAC  was highly advantageous to patients with nonpelvic primaries.

What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?,"AAUAAA hexamer.   This is mentioned in the first context as the ""most canonical AAUAAA hexamer"" used to search for polyadenylation signals in human genes.","Context:  A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in  silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants  that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were  identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at  least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these  hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals.

Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors","19032167, 1915889, 23776204","Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. It binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells.,"Context:  Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content, Context: liquidators. Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other  tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal  cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout. There is  growing evidence that insufficient apoptosis allows irradiated cells to survive  and thereby contributes to carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present survey is  to summarize the recent findings related to apoptotic biomarkers among cancer  patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe.  Among the particularly radiosensitive cancer sites, we focused on thyroid cancer  and leukemia. Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis. The data reviewed here  provide a mechanistic link between the apoptosis alterations and development of  radiation-related cancer in the 30-year post-Chornobyl period. We suggest that the type of mutations arising from misrepair of DNA double strand breaks (gene  fusion and amplification) is the initial signature event in radiation-induced  thyroid cancer. Much work has to be done over the next years to elucidate, Context: Programmed cell death plays an important role in animal development, tissue  homeostasis and eliminating harmful or virally infected cells. Necroptosis, a  novel form of programmed cell death, is caspase independent but RIPK and RIPK3  dependent. Moreover, it is suggested that necroptosis can be specifically  inhibited by small molecular inhibitors such as necrostatin-1. Its signaling  pathways have something in common with apoptosis, although the molecular mechanisms of necroptosis need to be further elucidated. Previous evidences  suggest that necroptosis has significant effects in regulating various  physiological processes and disease, such as ischemic brain injury, immune system disorders and cancer.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair, but it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to carcinogenesis.","Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context:  DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous  agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to  replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. The creation of diverse lymphocyte receptors to  identify potential pathogens requires breaking and randomly resorting gene  segments encoding antigen receptors. Subsequent repair of the gene segments utilises ubiquitous DNA-repair proteins. Individuals with defective repair  pathways are found to be immunodeficient and many are radiosensitive.

This recombination usually occurs at a low  frequency, but it is greatly enhanced by UV irradiation or other environmental stresses. DNA damages produced by these environmental stresses are thought to  induce DNA double-strand breaks, leading to illegitimate recombination. In this  paper we show that UV-induced illegitimate recombination is enhanced by mutations of nucleotide excision repair genes, uvrA or uvrB, and partially by  uvrC mutation, but not by uvrD mutation.

A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools. The subjects were separated into two groups: 159  students were treated with acupuncture on the anti-smoking acupoints of the ear, which is known to be effective for cessation of smoking (case group), and 79  students were treated at other sites of the ear (control group). The acupuncture  treatment was alternately administered at each side of the ears on a weekly, Context: treatment group showed a significant decrease in the nicotine withdrawal symptom  score. Smoking cessation rate showed no significant difference between the  treatment group (27.1%) and the control group (20.3%) at the end of treatment.  There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation, Context: BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for human diseases of the lung,  heart, circulatory system and various kinds of cancers, and is a serious public  health problem worldwide. Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality  for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females). The treatment group (n = 59) received auricular acupuncture in Shen Men, Sympathetic, Mouth and Lung points for 8 weeks.

List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.,"Dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.","Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including  dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean  schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs, Context:  Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient, Context: Human brain function is mediated by biochemical processes, many of which can be  visualized and quantified by positron emission tomography (PET). PET brain  imaging of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A)-an enzyme metabolizing  neurotransmitters-revealed that MAO A levels vary widely between healthy men and  this variability was not explained by the common MAOA genotype (VNTR genotype),  suggesting that environmental factors, through epigenetic modifications, may mediate it. Here, we analyzed MAOA methylation in white blood cells (by  bisulphite conversion of genomic DNA and subsequent sequencing of cloned DNA  products) and measured brain MAO A levels (using PET and [(11)C]clorgyline, a radiotracer with specificity for MAO A) in 34 healthy non-smoking male  volunteers.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes. Initially, vectors based on simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications, but they can only transduce actively dividing cells.","Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR)","24158830, 21247248, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. These antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity because they are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already expressed by normal cells.,"Context: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune  surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides  derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules  expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now  numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated  control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the  intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of  tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to  as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma  (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting  a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to  an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence.

This detail is provided in the context under the heading ""AREAS COVERED"" where it says ""Evolocumab and alirocumab are","Context: INTRODUCTION: To answer the need of a better low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol control in statin-treated patients at high risk for cardiovascular  disease, new injectable lipid-lowering drugs with innovative mechanisms of  action are in advanced phase of development or have just been approved. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies  inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it  for degradation. Mipomersen specifically binds to a segment of the human  apolipoprotein B100 messenger RNA, blocking the translation of the gene product.

Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or  in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly limited to nasopharyngitis, injection site pain, arthralgia and back pain. EXPERT OPINION: Evolocumab is an innovative powerful lipid-lowering drug,  additive to statins and with an apparently large therapeutic range associated to a low rate of mild adverse events. If available data will be confirmed in  long-term trials with strong outcomes, Evolocumab will provide an essential tool  to treat high-risk patients who need to reach ambitious LDL-C target, Context: The discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a serine  protease which binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and targets  the receptors for lysosomal degradation, offered an additional route through  which plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels can be controlled. Initially, the  therapeutic approaches to reduce circulating levels of PCSK9 were focused on the  use of monoclonal antibodies. To that effect, evolocumab and alirocumab, two human monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, given on a background of  statin therapy, have been shown to markedly decrease LDL-C levels and  significantly reduce cardiovascular risk.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"I don't know the answer.  (Note: The provided contexts do not mention specific proteins such as GATA1, so I couldn't find any relevant information to provide a list of interaction partners.)","Context: Protein complexes are fundamental for understanding principles of cellular  organizations. As the sizes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are  increasing, accurate and fast protein complex prediction from these PPI networks  can serve as a guide for biological experiments to discover novel protein  complexes. However, it is not easy to predict protein complexes from PPI  networks, especially in situations where the PPI network is noisy and still  incomplete. Here, we study the use of indirect interactions between level-2  neighbors (level-2 interactions) for protein complex prediction. We know from  previous work that proteins which do not interact but share interaction partners (level-2 neighbors) often share biological functions. We have proposed a method  in which all direct and indirect interactions are first weighted using  topological weight (FS-Weight), which estimates the strength of functional association.

The association, then, should be tested in  other populations to clarify the possible involvement, if any, of the TNFR2  polymorphism in SLE or other related autoimmune diseases. The purposes of this study were to examine the TNFR2 polymorphism in Japanese patients with SLE and  to investigate its association with other autoimmune diseases accompanied by  vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, Buerger's disease, and Takayasu's arteritis.

Further population and functional studies will be of  particular importance to establish TNFR2 as one of the susceptibility genes to  SLE, Context:  A polymorphism in high-affinity receptor of TNF (TNFR2) gene, Met196Arg, was  reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese,  whereas the association could not be found in Europeans at all and this represents an apparent discrepancy. The association, then, should be tested in  other populations to clarify the possible involvement, if any, of the TNFR2  polymorphism in SLE or other related autoimmune diseases. The purposes of this study were to examine the TNFR2 polymorphism in Japanese patients with SLE and  to investigate its association with other autoimmune diseases accompanied by  vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, Buerger's disease, and Takayasu's","11169260, 10395102, 11169260",There is a TNFR2 3' flanking region polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"11607787, 11169260, 11196716, 11197692, 10395102"
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Cytoplasm.   The context mentions that mRNA localization determines its fate, and for instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress granules where their decay and storage are directed.","Context: The Pold3 gene encodes a subunit of the Polδ DNA polymerase complex. Pold3  orthologs are not essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or chicken DT40 cells,  but the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog is essential. POLD3 also has a  specialized role in the repair of broken replication forks, suggesting that  POLD3 activity could be particularly relevant for cancer cells enduring high  levels of DNA replication stress. We report here that POLD3 is essential for  mouse development and is also required for viability in adult animals.  Strikingly, even Pold3(+/-) mice were born at sub-Mendelian ratios, and, of  those born, some presented hydrocephaly and had a reduced lifespan. In cells, POLD3 deficiency led to replication stress and cell death, which were aggravated  by the expression of activated oncogenes. Finally, we show that Pold3 deletion  destabilizes all members of the Polδ complex, explaining its major role in DNA replication and the severe impact of its deficiency, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: A major obstacle in the effective treatment of chordoma is that there are no  identifiable biomarkers capable of predicting prognosis. Recent research has  indicated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat3) may be  an important prognostic marker in some cancers, but its role in chordoma tumors  has not been elucidated. In this study, the expression of Stat3 was evaluated in  chordoma tissue microarray that contains 70 chordoma samples. Cells in the tissue microarray showed nuclear staining for phosphorylated Stat3 in all  instances. The level of phosphorylated Stat3 expression correlated with the  survival and severity of the disease. Three chordoma cell lines were exposed to SD-1029, a novel inhibitor of Stat3 activation. MTT assay showed that the growth  of all chordoma cell lines was inhibited by SD-1029.

What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"The genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations. Microdeletions on chromosomal band 16 p","Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome characterized by  facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes, and growth and mental  retardation as the main clinical features. RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross  chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations. Translocations and inversions  involving chromosome band 16p13.3 form the minority of CBP mutations, whereas microdeletions occur more frequently (about 10%). Most deletion studies in RTS  are performed by FISH analysis, and five cosmids must be used to cover the whole  of the CBP gene, which spreads over 150 kb. Here we report the design of gene, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a developmental disorder comprising  abnormalities that include mental retardation, an unusual facial appearance,  broad thumbs and big toes is frequently associated with molecular lesions in the CREB-binding protein gene, CREBBP. The objective of the present study was to  identify and analyse CREBBP mutations in Indian RSTS patients on which there are  no data. Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots in  which ten novel pathogenic mutations were localized.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,No. The context does not mention anything about yeast proteins or their function as insulators.,"Context: pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. BACE1 pre-mRNA undergoes complex alternative  splicing, the regulation of which is not well understood. We identified a G-rich  sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection.  Mutation of the G-rich sequence decreased use of the normal 5' splice site of  exon 3, which leads to full-length and proteolytically active BACE1, and  increased use of an alternative splice site, which leads to a shorter,  essentially inactive isoform. Nuclease protection assays, nuclear magnetic  resonance, and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that this sequence folds  into a G-quadruplex structure. Several proteins were identified as capable of binding to the G-rich sequence, and one of these, heterogeneous nuclear  ribonucleoprotein H, was found to regulate BACE1 exon 3 alternative splicing and  in a manner dependent on the G-rich sequence. Knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H led to a decrease in the full-length BACE1 mRNA isoform as  well as a decrease in Aβ production from APP, suggesting new possibilities for  therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease, Context: In the early stages of apoptosis changes occur at the cell surface, which until  now have remained difficult to recognize. One of these plasma membrane  alterations is the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner side  of the plasma membrane to the outer layer, by which PS becomes exposed at the  external surface of the cell. Annexin V is a Ca2+ dependent phospholipid-binding  protein with high affinity for PS. Hence this protein can be used as a sensitive probe for PS exposure upon the cell membrane. Translocation of PS to the  external cell surface is not unique to apoptosis, but occurs also during cell  necrosis. The difference between these two forms of cell death is that during the initial stages of apoptosis the cell membrane remains intact, while at the  very moment that necrosis occurs the cell membrane looses its integrity and  becomes leaky. Therefore the measurement of Annexin V binding to the cell, Context: Adeno-associated viral vectors can be used as a platform for delivering  biological countermeasures against pandemic and biological threats.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line.","Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin.

Citrus fruits and juices are a rich  source of vitamin C and flavonoids, with a potential effect on the inflammatory  response. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evidence the potential anti-inflammatory effects of  the flavonoids hesperidin for its possible therapeutic application against  diverse pathologies. METHOD: In the present review, available literature about the anti-inflammatory  effects of hesperidin is reported and discussed. Moreover, we also discuss the  chemistry, bioavailability and proposed mechanisms of action of hesperidin. RESULTS: Hesperidin is a flavonoid present in high concentration in citrus species and has numerous biological properties, principally antioxidant and  anti-inflammatory. Several studies have been performed in order to evaluate the  effects of hesperidin as anti-inflammatory agent using cellular and animal models and few clinical trials. Hesperidin treatment decreased inflammatory  mediators and exerted significant antioxidant effects. The molecular basis for  its anti-inflammatory effects seems to be mediated by signalling pathways, Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear.
