What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,The deregulation of histone lysine methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. This suggests that alterations in epigenetic regulation may play a role in the development and progression of this tumor type.,"Context: and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  Recent observations in mouse models have demonstrated the importance of genome  surveillance, as defects in DNA repair pathways in animals can lead to genomic  instability in neural progenitor cells, resulting in medulloblastoma. The  current review will focus on the most recent findings on the molecular pathology  of medulloblastoma and discuss their potential contribution to treatments  directed by the molecular alterations, Context: Although low-grade gliomas predominate and have favorable outcomes, up to 20% of  pediatric gliomas are high-grade. These tumors are a major contributor to  cancer-related morbidity and mortality in infants, children, and adolescents,  with long-term survival rates of only 10 to 15%. The recent discovery of somatic  oncogenic mutations affecting chromatin regulation in pediatric high-grade  glioma has markedly improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and  these findings have stimulated the development of novel therapeutic approaches  targeting epigenetic regulators for disease treatment. We review the current  perspective on pediatric high-grade glioma genetics and epigenetics, and discuss the emerging and experimental therapeutics targeting the unique molecular  abnormalities present in these deadly childhood brain tumors","19747111, 27034984","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes.

Describe RIblast,RIblast is a method based on the seed-and-extension approach that discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. It achieves high prediction accuracy at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.,"Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions  using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA  secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that  RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing  programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),","28459942, 22544737","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58â€‰000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"GMOL is a desktop application designed to visualize genome structures using oligopaint FISH probes, allowing researchers to scale between six separate levels within the genome and highlight structural relationships that may not be obvious from sequence information alone.","Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context:  MOTIVATION: Genome plotting is performed using a wide range of visualizations  tools each with emphasis on a different informative dimension of the genome.  These tools can provide a deeper insight into the genomic structure of the  organism. RESULTS: Here, we announce a new visualization tool that is specifically  designed for chloroplast genomes. It allows the users to depict the genetic  architecture of up to ten chloroplast genomes in the vicinity of the sites connecting the inverted repeats to the short and long single copy regions. The  software and its dependent libraries are fully coded in R and the reflected plot  is scaled up to realistic size of nucleotide base pairs in the vicinity of the","26868282, 29659705","Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. Coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a bioinformatic platform, this technology could be extended to any organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. The method gives researchers precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging of chromosomal regions.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions, Context: upstream of the Set1A SET domain is necessary for interaction with CFP1, Ash2,  Rbbp5, and Wdr5. This protein domain is also required to mediate feedback  inhibition of Set1A and Set1B expression, which is a consequence of reduced  Set1A and Set1B stability when not associated with the methyltransferase  complex. Confocal microscopy reveals that Set1A and Set1B each localize to a  largely non-overlapping set of euchromatic nuclear speckles, suggesting that  Set1A and Set1B each bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make  non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and  gene expression","24681537, 17355966",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

What are the targets of pemigatinib?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: glutamate (E) corresponding to the second hinge residue, and a lysine (K) in the  Î²8-strand (the NEK triad). PDGFRÎ±/Î², Kit, CSF1R, VEGFR1/2/3, Flt3, Tek, and Tie  protein kinases are also regulated by a similar autoinhibitory brake mechanism.  Ponatinib binds to FGFR4 in a DFG-Dout conformation and is classified as a type  II inhibitor. Futibatinib, roblitinib, H3B-6527, fisogatinib, and PRN1371 bind  covalently to their FGFR target and are classified as type VI inhibitors.  Nintedanib, pazopanib, pemigatinib, rogaratinib, fisogatinib, and PRN1371 are  FGFR inhibitors lacking drug-enzyme crystal structures. All of the  aforementioned FGFR antagonists are orally effective. The development of FGFR inhibitors has lagged behind those of other receptor protein-tyrosine kinases.  However, the FDA approval of erdafitinib for the treatment of urinary bladder  cancers may stimulate additional work targeting the many other FGFR-driven  neoplasms, Context: FGFR3 mut/fus, it is the first approved targeted therapy in metastatic UC. Areas  covered: This review covers the preclinical and clinical evidence for  erdafitinib, summarizes the results of other FGFR inhibitors tested in UC and  explores future perspectives of FGFR inhibition in UC. Expert opinion: In the  era of precision medicine, erdafitinib approval marks a step forward in UC.  Erdafitinib qualifies as a compelling comparator in the salvage therapy setting.  Special attention must be paid to typical adverse class-effects of FGFR  inhibitors. In the near future, in order to achieve an optimal selection of  molecularly-altered tumors, it will be important to assess the performance of different diagnostic tools and to investigate the role of liquid biopsy.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding, affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels. This reduces MYB's ability to silence gamma-globin gene expression, leading to increased fetal hemoglobin (","Context: Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin  (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics. Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB  intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding,  affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels. These data  provide a functional explanation for the genetic association of HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphisms with human erythroid traits and HbF levels. Our results  further designate MYB as a target for therapeutic induction of HbF to ameliorate  sickle cell and Î²-thalassemia disease severity, Context:  Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors. Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,Yes. The context mentions that avelumab is among the recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma.,"Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,"The Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER) family.   This is mentioned in the context as ""the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER) family belongs to the RTKs superfamily"".","Context: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins  that mediate intracellular signaling by phosphorylating substrate proteins  involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation or migration. The  Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER) family belongs to the RTKs  superfamily, and comprises four members: EGFR (epidermal growth factor  receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. Physiologically, these receptors are activated by the ligands of the EGF family. In solid tumors other mechanisms of  activation, such as overexpression or molecular alterations have been reported,  and have been linked to tumour initiation/progression. Because of that, several strategies have been developed to target HER receptors and include i)  antibody-based therapies using monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular  domain of these receptors, and ii) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers.

Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context:  BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. However, it  remains unclear by what mechanism BAX is triggered to initiate apoptosis. Here,  we reveal the mechanism using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. An inactive BAX monomer was found to exhibit conformational heterogeneity and exist  at equilibrium in two conformations, one of which has never been reported. We  show that upon apoptotic stimulus by BH3-only peptides, BAX can be induced to convert into either a ligand-bound monomer or an oligomer through a  conformational selection mechanism.

The cell  proliferation changes of the transfected bladder urothelial carcinoma cells were  determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis caused by silencing MALAT1 was  evaluated using the flow cytometry assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The motility changes induced by silencing MALAT1 were measured using the wound  healing assay. RESULTS: MALAT1 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma compared with  matched normal urothelium (P=.008). The MALAT1 expression levels were greater in  high-grade carcinomas than in low-grade carcinoma (P=.001). The MALAT1  expression levels were greater in invasive carcinoma than in noninvasive carcinoma (P=.018). Cell proliferation inhibition, increased apoptosis, and  decreased motility were observed in MALAT1 small interfering RNA-transfected  bladder urothelial carcinoma T24 and 5637 cells. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 plays an oncogenic role in urothelial carcinoma of the  bladder. Silencing MALAT1 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for this  cancer, Context: increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth,  movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that RTH is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene, but does not mention any involvement of TR alpha1 mutations.","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients.

It is generally recommended that the replacement of thyroid hormone in patients with RTH be guided by the serum TSH concentration.  The variable responsiveness of tissues to thyroid hormone, however, makes it  difficult to balance the correct replacement dose. We present a case that brings into question the conventional wisdom about the replacement dose of thyroid  hormone in this scenario, and we review the pertinent literature.

In 13% of families in which D4Z4 alleles with 4-8 repeats segregate,  the diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy was reported only in one  generation. In conclusion, this large-scale analysis provides further  information that should be taken into account when counselling families in which  a reduced allele with 4-8 D4Z4 repeats segregates. In addition, the reduced  expression of disease observed in distant relatives suggests that a family's  genetic background plays a role in the occurrence of facioscapulohumeral  muscular dystrophy.

Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo.

Pathological features include characteristic intracytoplasmic MN inclusion  bodies and appearances on ubiquitin staining. The aetiopathogenesis of the  disease remains unknown and there is, to date, no effective treatment. Several  abnormalities have been demonstrated in neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and gene expression studies. Abnormalities in glutamate metabolism have led to the  excitotoxin hypothesis of MN destruction. Other theories include deficits in MN  trophic factors, trans-synaptic degeneration, impaired ability to detoxify putative toxic agents and impaired DNA/RNA metabolism.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. They are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome.,"Context:  Numerous viral vectors have been developed for the delivery of transgenes to  specific target cells. For persistent transgene expression, vectors based on  retroviruses are attractive delivery vehicles because of their ability to stably integrate their DNA into the host cell genome. Initially, vectors based on  simple retroviruses were the vector of choice for such applications. However,  these vectors can only transduce actively dividing cells. Therefore, much interest has turned to retroviral vectors based on the lentivirus genus because  of their ability to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells. The best  characterized lentiviral vectors are derived from the human immunodeficiency, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,Yes. These antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity because they are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already expressed by normal cells at high levels.,"Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous.

In addition, biomarkers may  help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to  sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide  cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity  of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including  immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g.,  CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR)  modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of  immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T  regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1.","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,Camels. The context mentions that MERS-CoV has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East.,"Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures  against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV, Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed","25791336, 28616501",The animal thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS is camels.,"25791336, 29239118, 29336306, 30146782"

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,I don't know the answer. The provided text does not mention the localization of stress granules in any cellular compartment.,"Context: Cerebellar morphogenesis occurs through a complex interplay of cell  proliferation and migration that in mouse and rat begins about midgestation and  ends in the third postnatal week. Cerebellar cells derive from germinative  matrices in the ventricular zone and the external granular layer. Like granule  cells, unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons situated in the  granular layer of the cortex and innervated by mossy fibers. While granule cells are produced from the external granular layer, the generation of UBCs is still  controversial. We utilized the reeler mutant mouse, which has widespread  misplacement of neurons due to lack of Reelin protein, to ascertain the origin of UBCs. In the reeler cerebellum, which is small and lacks foliation, Purkinje  cells are greatly reduced in number and in large part are located ectopically in  deep cerebellar masses. Granule cells are also reduced in number and form an, Context: Although glucagon secreted from pancreatic Î± cells plays a role in increasing  glucose concentrations in serum, the mechanism regulating glucagon secretion  from Î± cells remains unclear. Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), identified as an  adhesion molecule in Î± cells, has been reported not only to communicate among Î±  cells and between nerve fibers, but also to prevent excessive glucagon secretion  from Î± cells. Here, we investigated the effect of CADM1 expression on the  movement of intracellular secretory granules in Î± cells because the granule  transport is an important step in secretion. Spinning disk microscopic analysis  showed that granules moved at a mean velocity of 0.236Â Â±Â 0.010Â Î¼m/s in the mouse Î± cell line Î±TC6 that expressed CADM1 endogenously. The mean velocity was  significantly decreased in CADM1-knockdown (KD) cells (mean velocity:  0.190Â Â±Â 0.016Â Î¼m/s). The velocity of granule movement decreased greatly in Î±TC6 cells treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing reagent nocodazole, but not in  Î±TC6 cells treated with the actin-depolymerizing reagent cytochalasin D. No  difference in the mean velocity was observed between Î±TC6 and CADM1-KD cells","16344141, 27262873",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"
What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"The genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations.","Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome characterized by  facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes, and growth and mental  retardation as the main clinical features. RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross  chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations. Translocations and inversions  involving chromosome band 16p13.3 form the minority of CBP mutations, whereas microdeletions occur more frequently (about 10%). Most deletion studies in RTS  are performed by FISH analysis, and five cosmids must be used to cover the whole  of the CBP gene, which spreads over 150 kb. Here we report the design of gene, Context:  The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome with facial  abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes and mental retardation as the main  clinical features. Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 (refs 4-8). Here we report that  all these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the  human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression. We show that RTS results  not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 16p, but also from  point mutations in the CBP gene itself.
