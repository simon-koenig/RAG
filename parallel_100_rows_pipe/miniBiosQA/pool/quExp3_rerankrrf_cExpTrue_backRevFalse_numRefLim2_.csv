What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have shown frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases in Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Yes, Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are regulated by Sam68. This is stated in the context as these lncRN","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

What is ectopia lentis?,Ectopia lentis is a condition where the eye's lens is not in its normal position. This can either be an isolated issue or a sign of underlying systemic conditions. The condition has been linked to genes like ADAMTS,"Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

Describe RIblast,"Yes, RIblast is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. This","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),, Context: indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing  RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale  lncRNA datasets.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. This is demonstrated by the fact that in a repressive background, functional I elements (which are transcribed) have some of their sense transcripts kept in nurse cell nuclear f","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.  Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional  gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation.","23124062, 18809914",Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"No, the context does not provide information about visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes. The context only discusses a tool called GMOL for visualizing genome structures and an online system for identifying and visualizing synteny","Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context: multiple genomes.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to describe a minimal genome build. The text discusses the concept of a minimal genome and its challenges but doesn't specify what an actual minimal genome would look like. Additionally, it highlights","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed.

This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted.","24681537, 12208845",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2).

Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures.

CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth.

What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?,"Yes, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) has a positive inotropic effect on myocardial contractility, meaning it enhances heart muscle contraction.

However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l, which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway.","9088928, 9088928",TRH improves myocardial contractility,"9088928, 9225129, 15096458, 2848686, 1611701, 1979356"

The context only mentions that Yki is equivalent to YAP/TAZ in vertebrates, but it does not","Context:  The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene, designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan, Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis.

The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process.","23436753, 19576221","mTOR, TOG5,  DNA-PKcs, HEATR1, Rif1, B56γ, PR65/A, SF3b155, Pds5B","27072897, 26676747, 27549742, 28512144, 27066066, 20007090, 28415797, 28668119, 24120762, 22315229"

Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with  the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs.","1423320, 12766764","Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the tissue of origin of the HSP.

Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?,"Yes, two R/Bioconductor packages have been developed for copy number analysis. The copynumber package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation using penalized least squares principles.","Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at  different times or by different labs.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,"Yes, the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type","Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner.

Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?,"No, the context does not mention any resource developed for studying the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate. The context is about GRG5 protein and its role in stem cell fate decisions, particularly in embryonic stem cells","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells.","30214018, 25591463",Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines is a data and tool resource to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.,27710791
In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context when it mentions ""cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules)"" and ""once stress granules containing mutant","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.","20674093, 24090136",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"

Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe.

We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are molecules that result from the biotransformation of drugs in the body. They can bind covalently to cellular proteins and are believed to play a significant role in many idiosyncr","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies. Therapists need to have precise knowledge of human, Context: Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical  evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma.","21289580, 21082060","Yes, acupuncture can cause spinal epidural hematoma.","8456713, 21082060, 21289580, 27651774, 24094991, 25459742"
