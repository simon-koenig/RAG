What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it plays a role in tumorigenesis. Specifically, high levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) were found in","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation","23179372, 23179372, 14688019, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.

Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. The context mentions that SET7/9 methyltransferase activity is involved in depositing this mark.,"Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells, Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from  the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate  that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule  inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies, Context: Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational  modifications of core histones. Here we show that the H1 linker histone plays a  key role in regulating both DNA methylation and histone H3 methylation at the  H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells.

Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis.  This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to  transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted","23302691, 21940714, 23302691, 12208845",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

The product of this proto-oncogene is overexpressed in 25-30% of human breast cancer and is the target of selective immunotherapy. Concerned about the  ethnic differences on the expression of this oncogene, we have evaluated 143  consecutive specimens of primary breast cancer diagnosed in San Pablo Hospital, Puerto Rico. The specimens were analyzed for Her-2/neu expression using  immunohistochemistry assays (Hercept test).

We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to  mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells.  Dysfunction of apoptosis renders the cancer cell resistant to treatment as well  as promotes tumorigenesis. Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane  permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c and consequently cancer cell death. A number of drugs in clinical use are  known to indirectly activate Bax. Intriguingly, recent efforts demonstrate that  Bax can serve as a promising direct target for small-molecule drug discovery. Several direct Bax activators have been identified to hold promise for cancer  therapy with the advantages of specificity and the potential of overcoming  chemo- and radioresistance.

Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that most RTH patients are clinically euthyroid due to a compensatory role of TR alpha1, but it does not mention any mutations in TR alpha1 being implicated in the syndrome.","Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. All three mutations occurred in a heterozygous pattern and caused the following changes in the  mature form of the receptor protein: Asp322 to Asn, Glu333 to Gln, and Lys443 to  Asn, respectively. The first and third point mutations arose in two unrelated families from eastern Sicily, whereas the second concerned an individual from  southern Calabria, apparently presenting a sporadic form of the resistance  syndrome. The clinical and biochemical features of resistance to thyroid, Context:  Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), a syndrome of inherited tissue  hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone, is linked to thyroid hormone receptor (TR)  mutations. A typical feature of GRTH is variable severity of organ involvement among families that, surprisingly, does not correlate with the degree of  T3-binding impairment of the corresponding in vitro synthesized mutant TRs.  Furthermore, variations in the clinical severity among family members harboring identical TR beta mutations have been reported. We compared serum levels of  thyroid hormones that maintained a normal TSH in members of a large family with  GRTH divided in three groups: Group A, 8 affected subjects with a mutation, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,IL-17 receptor.,"Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab  neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical  trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The  biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials  was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible  differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A  ligand, Context: This article discusses the scientific rationale for the use of cytokine  inhibitors, including ustekinumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin (IL)-12 and  IL-23 pathways in psoriasis. Also addressed are the efficacy and safety data for  this agent, as well as for several emerging therapies that target other cytokine  pathways in psoriasis: the IL-17 inhibitors secukinumab, ixekizumab, and  brodalumab, the IL-23 blocker tildrakizumab, and the small-molecule kinase inhibitors apremilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 blocker) and tofacitinib (a Janus  kinase inhibitor), Context: siltuximab, and ramucirumab, as well as the Fc fusion proteins Factor IX-Fc and  Factor VIII-Fc; and the submission of first marketing applications for up to  five therapeutics (secukinumab, ch14.18, onartuzumab, necitumumab, gevokizumab).

We have  previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,  preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the  binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,Autosomal dominant.   This is mentioned in the first sentence of the provided text as a characteristic of FSHD.,"Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of  FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.","Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA.

What is the indication for isradipine?,Hypertension and other indications.,"Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications, Context: ventricular mass and no indication in mean circumferential shortening. There was  another indication of improved left ventricular performance. With the reduced  left ventricular mass and diastolic blood pressure, there was a reduction in the  ratio of peak systolic wall stress to fractional shortening per 100 g left  ventricular mass. There was a significant relationship between peak systolic  wall stress and fractional shortening per 100 g left ventricular mass index. The  directional change after left ventricular mass reduction with isradipine  indicated improved left ventricular function. There was an increase in left  ventricular wall thickness and mass both in those patients not controlled on isradipine combined with those treated with placebo (n = 10), and in those  treated with placebo (n = 5) there was an increase in wall thickness. These  changes occurred in five weeks. There was no regression to a lower mean of left ventricular mass or wall thickness during placebo. There was reduction in  electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-T changes of ischemia in those patients with  diastolic blood pressure reduced to less than 90 mm Hg. Isradipine monotherapy, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner, Context: The effects of isradipine in a rat model of embolic stroke [permanent occlusion  of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)] are reviewed. Isradipine, when present  or given up to 4 hours after the onset of stroke, reduces the infarct size,  determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 24 hours, and by histology 5  days, after MCA occlusion. These cytoprotective effects seem to be permanent and  are paralleled by an improvement in the neurological deficit. Isradipine has proved to be the most potent and effective calcium antagonist for reducing the  infarct size compared with other representatives of this class of drugs such as  nimodipine, nicardipine and flunarizine. Isradipine is cytoprotective after a stroke when used as an antihypertensive: at doses which normalise high blood  pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, isradipine reduces by more than 60%  the infarct size caused by a subsequent stroke.

They  are associated with poor outcomes due to their tendency to recur. While surgery  and radiation (RT) are first line therapy, no effective systemic medical  treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously  expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA  repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived  immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to  investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein  expression were evaluated in vitro.

Two patients had dose-limiting  toxicity (reversible increases in serum creatinine or calculated serum, Context: The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB100, has been shown in  pre-clinical studies to be an effective chemo- and radio-sensitizer for  treatment of various cancers. We investigated effects associated with LB100  treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in  vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100  had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines. It also  attenuated MB cell migration, a pre-requirement for invasion. When used in  combination, LB100 enhanced cisplatin-mediated cytotoxic effects.

The LACE index is one of the most popular predictive  tools among hospitals in the United States. The LACE index is a simple tool with  4 parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency  visits in the previous 6 months. The authors applied logistic regression to develop a predictive model for a medium-sized not-for-profit community hospital  in California using patient-level data with more specific patient information  (including 13 explanatory variables). Specifically, the logistic regression is applied to 2 populations: a general population including all patients and the  specific group of patients targeted by the CMS penalty (characterized as ages 65  or older with select conditions). The 2 resulting logistic regression models, Context: analyzed. All brain tumor cases for which the patient was alive at 30 days after  surgery were included (n = 352).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,Yes. The context mentions that homologous recombination (HR) can be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to carcinogenesis.,"Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: Smc1-Smc3 cohesin complex is loaded onto chromatin around the DSB to support  recombination-mediated DSB repair. In this study, we investigated whether Ctf18,  a factor implicated in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, is  involved in DSB repair in budding yeast. Ctf18 was recruited to HO-endonuclease  induced DSB sites in an Mre11-dependent manner and to damaged chromatin in G2/M  phase-arrested cells. The ctf18 mutant cells showed high sensitivity to  DSB-inducible genotoxic agents and defects in DSB repair, as well as defects in  damage-induced recombination between sister chromatids and between homologous  chromosomes. These results suggest that Ctf18 is involved in damage-induced homologous recombination, Context: expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have  revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by  misreplication, environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous  and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another  mechanism that can result in a loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements.  Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but  they are more likely to be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of  carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed.

Secondary-structural prediction  algorithms identified putative HEAT domains in the 300 N-terminal residues of  all Symplekins of known sequence. The structure and dynamics of this domain were  investigated to begin elucidating the role Symplekin plays in mRNA maturation.  The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Symplekin HEAT domain was  determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral surface for potential protein-protein interactions.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. The context mentions that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.,"Context: Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid  [G.

Mol, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the, Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR)","16717285, 21247248, 7624311, 15638709","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No, because they mostly arise by point mutations.","Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour.

Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?,copynumber and iGC.,"Context: BACKGROUND: Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an  accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented.

In addition,  evolocumab has been approved by the FDA for homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of PCSK9  inhibitors are unknown, Context: INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to  be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals  (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot  tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for  additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL  receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%,  apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a  dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly, Context: The discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a serine  protease which binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and targets  the receptors for lysosomal degradation, offered an additional route through  which plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels can be controlled. Initially, the  therapeutic approaches to reduce circulating levels of PCSK9 were focused on the  use of monoclonal antibodies. To that effect, evolocumab and alirocumab, two human monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, given on a background of  statin therapy, have been shown to markedly decrease LDL-C levels and  significantly reduce cardiovascular risk.

Western blot  analysis showed no differences in cellular abundance of these proteins comparing  PINK1 mutant and control fibroblasts. When sequencing LRPPRC, four exonic  synonymous changes and 20 polymorphisms in noncoding regions were detected. Our  study provides a list of putative PINK1 binding partners, confirming previously  described interactions, but also introducing novel mitochondrial proteins as  potential components of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes.

Such lack of consistency could partly derive from the population admixture involved  in the case-control study. To avoid such a problem, polymorphisms in these genes  were analyzed using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in Caucasian SLE families. Ninety-one Caucasian SLE family samples recruited in southern  California were analyzed for the association with HLA-DRB1, TNF promoter  positions at -1031, -863, -857 and -308, and TNFR2-196M/R polymorphisms, Context:  Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors are considered to be involved  in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A number of previous  studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the  genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position  encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2).

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm.,"Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.

We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions.

The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven  imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported, Context:  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder  and is characterized by mental retardation, distinctive facial features, broad  and often angulated thumbs and great toes. We report on a 7 year old boy with classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. His facial and clinical features were very  typical, including broad thumbs with radial angulation and broad great toes.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,I don't know the answer. The provided context does not mention a direct relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients.,"Context: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3  administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic  rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to, Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies  have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical  hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3), Context: RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)).

In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: H3 receptors by selective H3 receptor antagonists has been shown to enhance the  release of neurotransmitters such as histamine, ACh, dopamine and  norepinephrine, among others, which play important roles in cognitive processes.  The cognitive-enhancing effects of H3 antagonists across multiple cognitive  domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also bolster confidence  in this therapeutic approach for the treatment of attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, although  a number of clinical studies examining the efficacy of H3 receptor antagonists  for a variety of cognitive disorders are currently underway, no clinical proof of concept for an H3 receptor antagonist has been reported to date. The  discovery of effective H3 antagonists as therapeutic agents for the novel  treatment of cognitive disorders will only be accomplished through continued research efforts that further our insights into the functions of the H3  receptor","27222271, 27222271, 22001260, 18469850",The H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 had an effect on cognition.,"18469850, 22001260, 27222271"
