Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma., Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye is subluxated due to the disruption of the zonular fibers. It is genetically heterogeneous and can either be isolated or associated","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis. In addition, this is the  first report of molecular characterization in an ectopia lentis family of Indian  origin., Context:  Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by  the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers.  Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications  including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated  form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the  pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region  contains well more than 60 genes.

The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing.

Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing  of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a  repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their  sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the  Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic  females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element  transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide enough information to determine a specific minimal genome build. The concept of a minimal genome is discussed as an ongoing pursuit in synthetic biology, with no single consensus or agreed-upon set of genes. Instead","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, Set7 deposits a specific type of histone mark.

This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions., Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells.

H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4.

Here we report the finding of recurrent  missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3  protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic  cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant  genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that  recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series., Context: Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000  live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed  dwarfism and macrocephaly.

It is now clear  that the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome critically impacts  nuclear activities such as transcription, replication, as well as cellular and  developmental events such as cell cycle, cell fate decision and embryonic  development. In this review, we discuss new insights into how the structural  features of the 3D genome hierarchy are established and maintained, how this  hierarchy undergoes dynamic rearrangement during normal development and how its perturbation will lead to human disease, highlighting the accumulating evidence  that links the diverse 3D genome architecture components to a multitude of human  diseases and the emerging mechanisms by which 3D genome derangement causes disease phenotypes., Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. During epidermal, Context: increase in the level of HuA. Upregulation of HuA corresponds to previously  documented increases in cytokine expression which are due to increased mRNA  stability following T cell activation. Consistent with these findings, HuA was  down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.","29990539, 24346698, 9763509","Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.","22495300, 25479748, 26340639, 24346698, 23199754, 24905166, 25218583, 25693564, 24305663"

RECENT FINDINGS: Available systemic drugs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  are limited. There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen.  Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment  of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2)  allergic inflammation are promising.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Yes, FSHD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

The context states ""FSHD is characterized by","Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease,  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement,  and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the  face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the  abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD  patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,"Yes, PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) is inhibited by LB-1","Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

What is ceritinib?,Ceritinib is an oral second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It demonstrates greater preclinical antitumor potency than crizotinib in AL,"Context: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis  of selected tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the  sensitivity to ceritinib., Context:  Ceritinib is an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor developed by  Novartis for the treatment of tumours characterised by genetic abnormalities in  ALK. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases that can become oncogenic when fused to other proteins. Ceritinib has been approved in  the US under 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation for the second-line treatment of  ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for, Context:  BACKGROUND: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate  melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger  groups of dermatologists are lacking.

In this paper, we describe a method for the  immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with  glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the  positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At  electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely  resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always  showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology.

Interestingly, cell aggregation by itself induced Nanog repression at the outer  layer, which was essential for aggregation-induced primitive endoderm formation.  These data illustrate aggregation-based cell-fate specification during early  embryonic development, when downregulation of Nanog plays a crucial role., Context:  Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications  and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion  or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing  that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV  datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs.

But LACE+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P =  0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218).

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. The context states that breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases, has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR)","Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: possible to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse manifestation of DNA damage  resulting from defects in any of the large variety of DNA double-strand break  (DSB) repair mechanisms. Breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases,  has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway,  which in turn switches damage removal towards alternative, more error-prone DSB  repair pathways such as microhomology-mediated non-homologous end joining  (mmNHEJ). Indeed, increased error-prone DSB repair activities were detected in  peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with familial breast cancer risk  independently of specific gene mutations. Intriguingly, sequence analysis of breakpoint regions revealed that the majority of genome aberrations found in  breast cancer specimens are formed by mmNHEJ. Detection of pathway-specific  error-prone DSB repair activities by functional testing was proposed to serve as biomarker for hereditary breast cancer risk and responsiveness to therapies  targeting HR dysfunction. Identification of specific error-prone DSB repair  mechanisms underlying CNAs and ultimately mammary tumour formation highlights, Context: to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of  dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have  tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce  apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved  complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these  lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an  overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of  DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited  or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to  radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair  and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer.","23675572, 23541693, 12016139",Yes.

Which are the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Yki?,"Yes, mammalian YAP1 is the ortholog of Drosophila Yki. This is stated in the second context where it mentions ""A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the ortholog of Dros","Context: (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on  the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the  physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also  induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We  also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or  proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.  Thus, our studies reveal that two different events in the reovirus replication  cycle can injure host cells by distinct mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: Virus-induced cell death is a determinant of pathogenesis. Mammalian reovirus is a versatile experimental model for identifying viral and host  intermediaries that contribute to cell death and for examining how these factors  influence viral disease. In this study, we identified that in addition to apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death, reovirus is capable of inducing an  alternate form of controlled cell death known as necroptosis. Death by this  pathway perturbs the integrity of host membranes and likely triggers, Context: neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in  the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis., Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells.

Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations., Context: determined to 2.4 A resolution with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing methods. The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process., Context: repeats. The number and order of these repeats have not changed since the common  origin of fungi, plants, and mammals. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the  various alpha-Kaps fall into two groups, alpha1 and alpha2. Whereas animals  encode both types, the yeast genome encodes only an alpha1-Kap. The beta-Kaps  are characterized by 14-15 tandemly arranged HEAT motifs. We show that the Arm  repeats of alpha-Kaps and the HEAT motifs of beta-Kaps are similar, suggesting  that the alpha-Kaps and beta-Kaps (and for that matter, all Arm and HEAT  repeat-containing proteins) are members of the same protein superfamily.  Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three major groups of beta-Kaps, consistent with their proposed cargo specificities.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about three indications for bupropion. They are: 1. As an antidepressant - this is the indication for which bupropion was originally developed. 2. As a tobacco use","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: self-administration. Current studies show that bupropion facilitates the  acquisition of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats, further suggesting  that bupropion enhances the rewarding properties of nicotine. Bupropion has been  shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal  models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that  bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large  individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a  treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it  was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials, bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug  abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is  available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism  of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may  contribute to its clinical profile.","16027765, 18264876, 17227286","Bupropion is used to treat Obesity, for smoking cessation and for depression","16831112, 15479310, 9554323, 17227286, 12043548, 18219560, 18264876, 26137782, 18619194, 15155135, 10804045, 27038550, 16546007, 25223901, 25661549, 25895022, 23859696, 21142259, 16027765, 21274361"

RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025).

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes, retroviruses are used for gene therapy. The context states that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: of signals and their transmission led to the discovery and the use of Bone  Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). The development of cellular therapy led to the  emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which  include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV).  Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have  successfully been transfected. The ability to control transfected cells and the  capacity to combine and transfect many genes involved in osseous healing will  improve gene therapy., Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the","21247248, 21798570, 7624311","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.

Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: documented (reviewed in Hämmerling et al, 1987). However, the key question of  whether cytolytic T cell attack has a role in human cancer remains unsolved.  Similarly, the role of NK cells is unclear; these seem to lyse cells with low  levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias.

We recently demonstrated that halofuginone (HF), a widely studied  derivative of febrifugine, inhibits the development of T(H)17-driven  autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by activating the amino acid  response (AAR) pathway. Here we show that HF binds glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA  synthetase (EPRS), inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity; this inhibition  is reversed by the addition of exogenous proline or EPRS. We further show that  inhibition of EPRS underlies the broad bioactivities of this family of natural  product derivatives. This work both explains the molecular mechanism of a promising family of therapeutics and highlights the AAR pathway as an important  drug target for promoting inflammatory resolution., Context: CAR-T cell, lisocabtagene ciloleucel is currently being evaluated in large  clinical trials and may also be United States Food and Drug  Administration-approved soon. CAR-T cell-related toxicities, including  infections, cytokine release syndrome, and neurotoxicity are potential  complications of therapy. With increasing use of CAR-T cells, the mechanism of  toxicities and mitigation strategies needs to be developed. Additionally,  reasons for CAR-T cell failure and progression following this therapy needs to  be further studied. We describe the recent developments in this field, with  emphasis on the complications of therapy and factors contributing to toxicities, efficacy, and resistance. We also describe the ongoing research in this field  and the newer CAR-T cell constructs that are being developed to counter the  challenges that have been identified in this field., Context: CAR T-cells have transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with  relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Currently, three CAR T-cell  products are approved or soon to be approved: axicabtagene ciloleucel,  tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel. These products differ in  construct, manufacturing, clinical trial design and toxicity profile. Patient  selection for CAR T-cells, and the ideal product for a given patient, involves myriad considerations including age, fitness, prior therapies, comorbid  diseases, organ function, logistics of administration, turnaround time, and  institutional familiarity.

In the first  case laparoscopy was performed, in the second case laparoscopy and then  laparotomy due to massive adhesions were performed.  RESULTS: In both cases histopathological examinations showed: cystis picea  endometriotica ovarii. Both patients delivered at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Surgical management of ovarian endometriomas does not complicate pregnancy course., Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether conservative surgery on ovarian endometriomas  before an IVF cycle improves fertility outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, matched case-control study. SETTING: Two academic IVF programs.  PATIENT(S): One hundred eighty-nine women with endometriomas who underwent IVF  treatment: 56 women proceeded directly to IVF, and 133 first underwent  conservative ovarian surgery.

METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes.

In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes. We propose that Ski  cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering  with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia.","19534736, 18844071, 15542823","GATA-1 interact with factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, FOG-1, TAL-1, Ldb-1 and LMO2-C.","16339652, 17108004, 18844071, 15542823, 12032775, 21532337, 20959602, 15920471"

In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.

Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed.

The context discusses the role of GRG5 in embryonic stem cell fate decisions and T-cell","Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, stress granules localize in the cytoplasm. This is stated explicitly in the context where it mentions that stress granules ""transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress.""","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1).

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,"No, Abf1 cannot act as an insulator. The context does not provide any information suggesting that Abf1 has a role in chromatin insulation or functions as an insulator protein.","Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes.

Interestingly, the results strongly suggest that Rap1 can  contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can Abf1. Also,  consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss  of binding than those that bind Rap1. Finally, we show for several such genes  that the Abf1 C-terminal region, which contains the putative activation domain,  is not needed to confer this peculiar 'memory effect' that allows continued  transcription after loss of Abf1 binding., Context:  Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to  transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to  replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast.

CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations.

Differences in total costs were  driven mainly by differences in pharmacy expenditures.  CONCLUSIONS: Of the oral agents approved for treating PAH at the time of this  study, sildenafil was most commonly prescribed as index therapy and was also  associated with the lowest costs, largely due to significantly lower pharmacy  costs. This study is characterized by limitations inherent to claims database  analyses, such as the potential for coding errors and lack of information on  whether a drug was taken as prescribed. Furthermore, PAH severity (WHO functional class) was not assessed., Context: sotatercept 0.3-mg group and the placebo group in the change from baseline in  6-minute walk distance was 29.4 m (95% CI, 3.8 to 55.0). The least-squares mean  difference between the sotatercept 0.7-mg group and the placebo group was 21.4 m  (95% CI, -2.8 to 45.7). Sotatercept was also associated with a decrease in  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Thrombocytopenia and an  increased hemoglobin level were the most common hematologic adverse events. One  patient in the sotatercept 0.7-mg group died from cardiac arrest.

We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications.
