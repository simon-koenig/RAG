What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it plays a role in these tumors. Frequent mutations in H3K27 demethylases and high levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3,"Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors.

These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context:  Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active  chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified.  Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. KDM4A  demethylates H3K36me3, a modification enriched in the 3' end of active genes.  The genomic targets and the role of KDM4 proteins in development remain largely unknown. We therefore generated KDM4A mutant Drosophila, and identified 99  mis-regulated genes in first instar larvae. Around half of these genes were  down-regulated and the other half up-regulated in dKDM4A mutants.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,Monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the histone methyltransferase PR-Set7.,"Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks.

The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation","23302691, 23302691, 27131378",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

New CGRP receptor antagonists would be expected for  acute migraine treatment, Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the preventive therapy of migraine,  including indications, strategies for use, and available treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are  recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The  decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the  frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated  disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness  to such treatments, and patient preferences.

Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?,"Yes. The context states that Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c.","Context: however, no differential study has been conducted to clarify which one of these  mechanisms predominates over the other in the same system. In the present study,  we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax  and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell, Context: Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to  mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells.  Dysfunction of apoptosis renders the cancer cell resistant to treatment as well  as promotes tumorigenesis. Bax activation induces mitochondrial membrane  permeabilization, thereby leading to the release of apoptotic factor cytochrome c and consequently cancer cell death. A number of drugs in clinical use are  known to indirectly activate Bax. Intriguingly, recent efforts demonstrate that  Bax can serve as a promising direct target for small-molecule drug discovery. Several direct Bax activators have been identified to hold promise for cancer  therapy with the advantages of specificity and the potential of overcoming  chemo- and radioresistance. Further investigation of this new class of drug, Context:  In response to many apoptotic stimuli, oligomerization of Bax is essential for  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the ensuing release of  cytochrome c. These events are accompanied by mitochondrial fission that appears to require Drp1, a large GTPase of the dynamin superfamily. Loss of Drp1 leads  to decreased cytochrome c release by a mechanism that is poorly understood. Here  we show that Drp1 stimulates tBid-induced Bax oligomerization and cytochrome c release by promoting tethering and hemifusion of membranes in vitro. This  function of Drp1 is independent of its GTPase activity and relies on arginine  247 and the presence of cardiolipin in membranes.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes. In both contexts, MALAT-1 expression is mentioned as being upregulated in cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues.","Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize, Context: Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a long  non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and associated  with cancer metastasis and recurrence. However, its role in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated  the expression of MALAT1 by quantitative real-time PCR in 9 liver cancer cell  lines and 112 HCC cases including 60 cases who received liver transplantation  (LT) with complete follow-up data. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was  used to inhibit MALAT1 expression to investigate its biological role in tumor  progression. We found that MALAT1 was up-regulated in both cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Patients with high expression level of MALAT1 had a  significantly increased risk of tumor recurrence after LT, particularly in  patients who exceeded the Milan criteria. On multivariate analysis, MALAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting HCC recurrence (hazard ratio,  3.280, P = 0.003).In addition, inhibition of MALAT1 in HepG2 cells could  effectively reduce cell viability, motility, invasiveness, and increase the, Context: expression was regulated by an endogenous negative feedback loop. In A549  NSCLCs, RNAi-mediated suppression of MALAT-1 RNA suppressed migration and  clonogenic growth. Forced expression of MALAT-1 in NIH 3T3 cells significantly  increased migration. Upon injection into nude mice, NSCLC xenografts with  decreased MALAT-1 expression were impaired in tumor formation and growth. In  situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue probes revealed that  high MALAT-1 RNA expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was  associated with a poor prognosis. On genetic level, MALAT-1 displays the  strongest association with genes involved in cancer like cellular growth, movement, proliferation, signaling, and immune regulation.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,IL-17A receptor subunit A.   Brodalumab is an IL-17A monoclonal antibody that targets this receptor subunit.,"Context: sclerosis. Secukinumab is an IL-17A monoclonal antibody that is under  development and preliminary results have suggested its efficacy in inflammatory  mediated diseases such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Several other  IL-23 or IL-17 neutralizing agents are being evaluated in clinical trials. The  biological properties of the IL-23/Th17/IL-17 axis and the clinical applications  of the drugs that aim to block its functions are reviewed here. Targeting the  IL-23/Th17 axis seems to be a relevant and realistic therapeutic approach and  these new agents pave the way for additive and alternative treatments to  currently available biologics in chronic inflammatory diseases, Context: mechanism through which ACE2 plays a role in inflammatory lung disease has not  been clearly identified. In an attempt to summarize current literature findings  and progress made in uncovering the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease,  this review will focus on recent studies examining pulmonary ACE2 biology, its  roles in inflammatory lung disease pathogenesis and possible underlying  mechanisms. Finally, we will discuss pulmonary ACE2 as a potential therapeutic  target for inflammatory lung disease, Context: IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-12 cytokine family.  IL-23 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes, a subtype of T  lymphocyte implicated in chronic inflammatory/autoimmune mediated diseases.  IL-23 and Th17 correspond to a new axis that drives immune activation and  chronic inflammation through the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells.  Animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic joint diseases,  inflammatory bowel diseases and demyelinating diseases strongly suggest the  involvement of this cytokine pathway. Thus, IL-23/Th17 is considered as a  relevant therapeutic target in autoimmune driven diseases, and biological agents blocking IL-23 or IL-17 are currently being developed. Ustekinumab is a  monoclonal antibody targeting the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23.

Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: The plasmepsins are key enzymes in the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasites  responsible for malaria. Since plasmepsin inhibition leads to parasite death,  these enzymes have been acknowledged to be important targets for the development  of new antimalarial drugs. The development of effective plasmepsin inhibitors,  however, is compounded by their genomic diversity which gives rise not to a  unique target for drug development but to a family of closely related targets.  Successful drugs will have to inhibit not one but several related enzymes with  high affinity. Structure-based drug design against heterogeneous targets  requires a departure from the classic 'lock-and-key' paradigm that leads to the development of conformationally constrained molecules aimed at a single target.  Drug molecules designed along those principles are usually rigid and unable to  adapt to target variations arising from naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms or drug-induced resistant mutations. Heterogeneous targets need  adaptive drug molecules, characterised by the presence of flexible elements at  specific locations that sustain a viable binding affinity against existing or, Context: sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination is widespread. Analysis using molecular,  genetic and biochemical approaches has shown that the mechanism of resistance to  sulfadoxine involves mutation of dihydropteroate synthase, the enzyme target of  this group of drugs.

The unique Plasmodium ThrRS is the presumed  target of the antimalarial compound borrelidin. Borrelidin kills P. falciparum  parasites quickly without the delayed death effect typical of apicoplast  translation inhibitors and without an observable effect on apicoplast  morphology. By contrast, mupirocin, an inhibitor of the apicoplast IleRS, kills  with a delayed death effect that inhibits apicoplast growth and division.  Because inhibition of dual targeted tRNA synthetases should arrest translation  in all compartments of the parasite, these enzymes deserve further investigation as potential targets for antimalarial drug development","12435452, 11504465, 22222968","Imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA subunit.

List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.,"Dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.","Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including  dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean  schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs, Context:  Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) is a critical enzyme in the catabolism of  monoaminergic neurotransmitters. MAOA transcriptional activity is thought to be  regulated by a well characterized 30 base pair (bp) variable nucleotide repeat (VNTR) that lies approximately ∼1000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start  site (TSS). However, clinical associations between this VNTR genotype and  behavioral states have been inconsistent. Herein, we describe a second, 10 bp VNTR that lies ∼1500 bp upstream of the TSS. We provide in vitro and in silico  evidence that this new VNTR region may be more influential in regulating MAOA  transcription than the more proximal VNTR and that methylation of this CpG-rich, Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of  neurotransmitter amines. A functional polymorphism in the human MAOA gene (high-  and low-MAOA) has been associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. To investigate directly the biological mechanism whereby this polymorphism  influences brain function, we recently measured the activity of the MAO A enzyme  in healthy volunteers. When found no relationship between the individual's brain MAO A level and the MAOA genotype, we postulated that there are additional  regulatory mechanisms that control the MAOA expression.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes. The context mentions that the therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses has been limited by problems of vector expression and vector-mediated genotoxicity, but it also implies their potential use in gene therapy.","Context: Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into  chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over  eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and  human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are  critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the  insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites.  Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called  V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid  [G.

Mol, Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context:  Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means  of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells.  Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however,  has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to  efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the  interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect  vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the","16717285, 21247248, 7624311","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No, because they mostly arise by point mutations.","Context: Early investigations into the immune surveillance of chemically-induced sarcomas  led to two important concepts in tumour immunobiology: one, tumour rejection can  be elicited by immune recognition of tumour antigens; and two, tumours express  unique sets of antigens, which are known as tumour-specific antigens. The  pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues led to the proposal that  heat-shock proteins (HSPs) function as ubiquitous tumour-specific antigens, with the specificity residing in a population of bound peptides that identify the  tissue of origin of the HSP. However, recent findings, including new data on the  cell biology of peptide generation and trafficking, have called into question the specificity of tumour rejection that is induced by HSPs, Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,Ski and Gfi-1B are interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Context: Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific  transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in  erythropoiesis. Our laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B promoter  region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription.  By further investigating the regulation of the Gfi-1B promoter, here we report  that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negatively regulated by its own gene product,  (ii) GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites in the  Gfi-1B promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses GATA-1-mediated stimulation of  Gfi-1B promoter through their protein interaction. These results not only demonstrate that interaction of GATA-1 and Gfi-1B participates in a feedback  regulatory pathway in controlling the expression of the Gfi-1B gene, but also  provide the first evidence that Gfi-1B can exert its repression function by acting on GATA-1-mediated transcription without direct binding to the Gfi-1 site  of the target genes. Based on these data, we propose that this negative  auto-regulatory feedback loop is important in restricting the expression level, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation.

Which part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease caused by genetic  and epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation abnormalities play an important role  in systemic lupus erythematosus disease processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at  the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been  described in various disease states, including human lupus.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,The stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress.,"Context:  Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance, Context: Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be  found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode  several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with  the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small  number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a  diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However,  UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but  was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation,  we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA  distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that  block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model, Context:  Stress granules (SGs) are RNA-containing cytoplasmic foci formed in response to  stress exposure. Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been  described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications). Most of these components are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or are involved in RNA  metabolism and translation. SGs have been linked to several pathologies  including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia  (FTD).

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context states that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context:  Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have  shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a  potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"The study found a significant relationship between thyroid hormones and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. Specifically, it was observed that a low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF","Context: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, Context: Cytokines and thyroid hormones are involved in the biochemical changes  associated to heart failure (HF). AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the  cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy subjects (30 males, age range 26-75 years) were also enrolled as control group  (Group N). High sensitivity (hs)-IL-6 and hs-TNFalpha were quantified using  solid phase sandwich ELISA kits. Hs-CRP was measured by Immulite System, Context:  To determine the prevalence and significance of abnormal thyroid hormone  metabolism in congestive heart failure, free thyroxine (T4) index, free  triiodothyronine (T3) index, reverse T3 and thyrotropin levels were obtained in 84 hospitalized patients with chronic advanced heart failure. Free T4 index was  normal in all patients. Free T3 index was reduced or reverse T3 elevated, or  both, leading to a low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio in 49 (58%) of the 84 patients. A low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio was associated with higher right  atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and lower  ejection fraction, cardiac index, serum sodium, albumin and total lymphocyte","8333797, 19926244, 2358611",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. It may be a candidate agent for neuroprotective treatment in the retina.,"Context:  We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress. We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-α gene  expression.

Which receptors does bimagrumab block?,"Activin type II receptors.   This is mentioned in the context as ""a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type II receptors (ActRII)"".","Context: bimagrumab-treated patients, whereas no changes were observed with placebo (Week  4: +5.9% [SD, 3.4%] vs. 0.0% [3.3%], P < 0.001; Week 8: +7.0% [3.7%] vs. -0.7%  [2.8%], P < 0.001; Week 16: +7.8% [5.1%] vs. -0.9% [4.5%], P < 0.001; Week 24:  +5.0% [4.9%] vs. -1.3% [4.3%], P < 0.001). Over 24 weeks, 6-minute-walk distance  did not increase significantly in either group. Adverse events in the bimagrumab  group included muscle-related symptoms, diarrhea, and acne, most of which were  mild in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the action of negative muscle regulators through the  activin type II receptors with bimagrumab treatment safely increased skeletal  muscle mass but did not improve functional capacity in patients with COPD and low muscle mass. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov  (NCT01669174), Context: BACKGROUND: Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type  II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking  binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab  is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip  fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous  ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM: To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS: Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Pituitary-gonadal and  pituitary-adrenal functions were evaluated with basal hormone measurement and  standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone, Context:  RATIONALE: Bimagrumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the  activin type II receptors, preventing the activity of myostatin and other  negative skeletal muscle regulators.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,NBEAL2 mutations are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"Context:  NBEAL2 encodes a multidomain scaffolding protein with a putative role in granule  ontogeny in human platelets. Mutations in NBEAL2 underlie gray platelet syndrome  (GPS), a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a lack of α-granules within blood platelets and progressive bone marrow fibrosis. We present here a  novel Nbeal2(-/-) murine model of GPS and demonstrate that the lack of  α-granules is due to their loss from platelets/mature megakaryocytes (MKs), and not by initial impaired formation. We show that the lack of Nbeal2 confers a  proinflammatory phenotype to the bone marrow MKs, which in combination with the  loss of proteins from α-granules drives the development of bone marrow fibrosis, Context:  Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder that is  characterized by large platelets that lack α-granules. Here we show that  mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with  GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts. Proteomic analysis of  sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets, Context:  Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an inherited bleeding disorder associated with  macrothrombocytopenia and α-granule-deficient platelets.
