What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it plays a role in tumorigenesis. Specifically, high levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) are found in","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation","23179372, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization. We present evidence that the majority of this effect is  mediated by the DosR-regulated protein MSMEG_3935 (a S30AE domain protein),","28459942, 22544737","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization","Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This unit details how Oligopaint probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each  of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside  cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence  labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path  of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus  from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized  to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,Monomethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1) is mediated by PR-Set7.,"Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: particularly manifesting as increased promoter DNA methylation with associated  aberrant gene silencing, which plays a significant role in tumor progression. We  now globally map key chromatin parameters for genes with promoter CpG island DNA  hypermethylation in colon cancer cells by combining microarray gene expression  analyses with chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip technology. We first show  that the silent state of such genes universally correlates with a broad  distribution of a low but distinct level of the PcG-mediated histone  modification, methylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me), and a very low  level of the active mark H3K4me2. This chromatin pattern, and particularly H3K4me2 levels, crisply separates DNA-hypermethylated genes from those where  histone deacetylation is responsible for transcriptional silencing. Moreover,  the chromatin pattern can markedly enhance identification of truly silent and DNA-hypermethylated genes. We additionally find that when DNA-hypermethylated  genes are demethylated and reexpressed, they adopt a bivalent chromatin pattern,  which is associated with the poised gene expression state of a large group of","27131378, 18632628",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

What are the targets of pemigatinib?,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, FGFR2, and FGFR3.","Context: Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide. Both, the  major forms of lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small cell  lung cancers (SCLC), have responded effectively to chemo-, radiation and  adjuvant-therapies. Tumor removal through surgery also appeared as a good  therapeutic strategy. However, these therapies demonstrated unfavourable  side-effects, and hence novel drugs targeting lung cancer emerged essential. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinases is a key  reason for lung cancer progression. Two important strategies that have  attenuated lung cancers were through treatments with EGFR-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, or EGFR-neutralizing antibodies,  cetuximab and bevacizumab. A major advantage with erlotinib and gefitinib was  their role in second and third-line treatments following chemotherapies.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"These variants affect regulatory elements that interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. They also influence key erythroid transcription factors within this region, thereby regulating fetal hemoglobin.","Context:  Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors. Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression, Context:  Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits. It is unclear how these noncoding sequence variants affect multiple  erythrocyte characteristics.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,The HER-2 protein belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.,"Context:  A correct three-dimensional structure is crucial for the physiological functions  of a protein, yet the folding of proteins to acquire native conformation is a  fundamentally error-prone process. Eukaryotic organisms have evolved a highly conserved endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein quality control (ERQC)  mechanism to monitor folding processes of secretory and membrane proteins,  allowing export of only correctly folded proteins to their physiological destinations, retaining incompletely/mis-folded ones in the ER for additional  folding attempts, marking and removing terminally misfolded ones via a unique  multiple-step degradation process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), Context:  Cell adhesion molecules are glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface and play  an important role in inflammatory as well as neoplastic diseases.

The presence of lymphedema is likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such,"Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome. This case highlights recurrent cellulitis as  one of the potential complications of Aagenaes syndrome, Context: Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant  adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological  abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish.

STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has been genetically linked to reduced  numbers (≤ 8) of D4Z4 repeats at 4q35 combined with 4A(159/161/168) DUX4  polyadenylation signal haplotype. However, we have recently reported that 1.3%  of healthy individuals carry this molecular signature and 19% of subjects  affected by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy do not carry alleles with  eight or fewer D4Z4 repeats. Therefore, prognosis for subjects carrying or at risk of carrying D4Z4 reduced alleles has become more complicated. To test for  additional prognostic factors, we measured the degree of motor impairment in a  large group of patients affected by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and their relatives who are carrying D4Z4 reduced alleles.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.","Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,I don't know the answer.,"Context: and we found that HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred  euchromatic genes. An expression analysis in HP1a mutants shows that HP1a is  required for positive regulation of these genes. Cytogenetic and molecular  assays show that HP1a also interacts with the well known proteins DDP1, HRB87F,  and PEP, which belong to different classes of heterogeneous nuclear  ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) involved in RNA processing. Surprisingly, we found  that all these hnRNP proteins also bind heterochromatin and are dominant  suppressors of position effect variegation. Together, our data show novel and  unexpected functions for HP1a and hnRNPs proteins. All these proteins are in fact involved both in RNA transcript processing and in heterochromatin  formation. This suggests that, in general, similar epigenetic mechanisms have a  significant role on both RNA and heterochromatin metabolisms, Context: A novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of  beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with  architecture obeying those proteins' construction principles. The HMM is trained  and tested on a non-redundant set of 11 beta-barrel membrane proteins known to  date at atomic resolution with a jack-knife procedure. As a result, the method  correctly locates 97% of 172 transmembrane beta-strands. Out of the 11 proteins, the barrel size for ten proteins and the overall topology for seven proteins are  correctly predicted.

Does lucatumumab bind to CD140?,No. The context does not mention lucatumumab binding to CD140.,"Context: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray  in Molt-4 cells before and after treatment of vorinostat. Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

What is known about the effect of acupuncture in smoking cessation ?,The study found that all groups showed significant reductions in smoking and posttreatment cigarette consumption. The combined acupuncture-education group showed the greatest effect from treatment.,"Context:  The use of alternative medicine for smoking cessation have been increasing  steadily in recent years. A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,"Yes. The context mentions ""the therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating gene transfer vectors"".","Context:  The therapeutic application of recombinant retroviruses and other integrating  gene transfer vectors has been limited by problems of vector expression and  vector-mediated genotoxicity. These problems arise in large part from the interactions between vector sequences and the genomic environment surrounding  sites of integration. Strides have been made in overcoming both of these  problems through the modification of deleterious vector sequences, the inclusion of better enhancers and promoters, and the use of alternative virus systems.  However, these modifications often add other restrictions on vector design,  which in turn can further limit therapeutic applications. As an alternative,, Context: Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two  different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and  visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B  disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS  symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis  fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase  cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly  synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in  transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low  efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human  cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase  cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the mouse  enzyme was found to be transferred to human cells at high efficiency. Enzyme","21247248, 10757351","Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research. Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The growing variety of tools for  measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays  and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified  and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In  addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation  algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number. RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is  presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound  penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints,  the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes  vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: Genotyping platforms such as Affymetrix can be used to assess genotype-phenotype  as well as copy number-phenotype associations at millions of markers. While  genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on HapMap samples,  tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for  batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab.,"Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are now ample data that demonstrate that inhibition of  PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) can safely lower LDL  cholesterol synergistically with statins. Considering that PCSK9 was first  identified less than a decade ago, the last few years have shown rapid and  remarkable advancements in our understanding and knowledge of the structure and  function of PCSK9. RECENT FINDINGS: Therapeutic developments have not lagged far behind with some  monoclonal antibodies currently entering phase III trials. Of the many  approaches to PCSK9 inhibition, these compounds are the furthest advanced in  their clinical development while small molecule oral inhibitors seem a distant  prospect. SUMMARY: This review summarizes the discovery and history of PCSK9 and in  particular its mode of action as an inhibitor of the LDL receptor. It also  recapitulates key studies that have demonstrated the potential of inhibiting PCSK9 to further decrease LDL-cholesterol levels safely and synergistically with  statins.

The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm.,"Context: may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of  mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant  protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the  effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions  of oxidative stress. RESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress  granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of","24090136, 25437551",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"
What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3 comprising cyclic adenosine","Context: microdeletion on chromosomal band 16 p13.3. CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context:  Familial Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th  and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS  over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother  (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3).

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,I don't know the answer. The provided text does not mention a relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients.,"Context:  Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,Yes. The results of the present study suggest that hesperidin has neuroprotective potential against QA induced HD like symptoms in rats.,"Context: dysfunction (decreased Complex-I, II, III, and IV activities), increased  striatal lesion volume and altered the levels of TNF-α, caspase-3 as well as  BDNF expression, as compared to sham group. Meanwhile, chronic hesperidin  (100mg/kg, p.o.) and minocycline (25mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 21 days  significantly attenuated the behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations as  compared to QA treated (control) animals, whereas hesperidin (50mg/kg, p.o.)  treatment was found to be non-significant. However, treatment of hesperidin  (50mg/kg) in combination with minocycline (25mg/kg) potentiated their  neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA treated animals. Taken altogether, the results of the present study  suggest a possible interplay of microglial modulation and anti-oxidant effect in  neuroprotective potential of hesperidin against QA induced HD like symptoms in  rats, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases","24211676, 16964766",Neuroprotective effect of hesperetin and nano-hesperetin on recognition memory impairment and the elevated oxygen stress in rat model of Alzheimer's disease,"28721824, 29687202, 30448580, 26381129, 24987179, 28761134, 22383310, 25860498, 30352242, 29136946, 21445621, 26342684, 24205431, 24211676, 16964766, 22850463"
