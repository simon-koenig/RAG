What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that defective control of the histone code contributes to its pathogenesis. This is suggested by copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and","Context: was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations  that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent  mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1  (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly  affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich  repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone  methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for  histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in  multiple cohorts of HCC, Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation","23728943, 23179372, 19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2.","Context: The KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 is required for adipogenesis. We have  previously shown that Sam68-deficient mice have a lean phenotype and are  protected against dietary-induced obesity due to defects in mTOR and S6K1  alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the, Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes.

RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation, Context: Our previous study found that the nuclear protein, 68-kDa Src-associated in  mitosis protein (Sam68), is translocated to the cytoplasm and forms punctate  pattern during enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection [Virus Research, 180 (2014),  1-11]. However, the exact function of this punctate pattern in cytoplasm during  EV71 infection remains unknown. In this study, we firstly have examined this  punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the  obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs). Sam68,  belongs to the KH domain family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), was then  confirmed that its KH domain was essential for this recruitment. Nevertheless, Knockdown of Sam68 expression using ShRNA had no effects on SGs assembly,  indicating that Sam68 is not a constitutive component of the SGs during EV71  infection. Lastly, we investigated the importance of microtubulin transport to SGs aggregation, and revealed that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SGs  formation, suggesting that EV71-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a  microtubule-dependent manner. Taken together, these results illuminated that, Context: lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites.

Describe RIblast,RIblast is a method based on the seed-and-extension approach for predicting RNA secondary structures. It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model.,"Context: method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions  using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA  secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that  RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing  programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online, Context: Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased  risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and  non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia. We report a patient  with acute basophilic leukaemia with 47, XXY karyotype in both the tumour and  constitutional cells. Acute basophilic leukaemia is very rare disease comprising  less than 1% of all acute myeloid leukaemias. Morphological characteristic of  leukaemic blast cells is moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing a variable  number of coarse basophilic granules. The most characteristic cytochemical  reaction is metachromatic positivity with toluidine blue. Blast are myeloperoxidase negative. Also leukemic blasts express myeloid and monocyte  markers. There is no consistent chromosomal abnormality identified in this  leukaemia. This is the first reported case of acute basophilic leukaemia in patient with Klinefelter syndrome. In this article the medical history of the  patient is given and the possible connection between Klinefelter syndrome and  acute myeloid leukaemia is discussed, Context: Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human  malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition  from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. This purine salvage  process is initiated by the transport of preformed purines into the parasite. We  have identified a gene encoding a nucleoside transporter from P. falciparum,  PfNT1, and analyzed its function and expression during intraerythrocytic  parasite development. PfNT1 predicts a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with 11  transmembrane domains that is homologous to other members of the equilibrative  nucleoside transporter family. Southern analysis and BLAST searching of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) malaria data base indicate that PfNT1 is a  single copy gene located on chromosome 14. Northern analysis of RNA from  intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite demonstrates that PfNT1 is expressed throughout the asexual life cycle but is significantly elevated during the early  trophozoite stage. Functional expression of PfNT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes  significantly increases their ability to take up naturally occurring D-adenosine, Context: For half a century the systolic click and late systolic murmur lay dormant as  innocent auscultatory curiosities. The thirteen years since Barlow related these  phenomena to mitral leaflet prolapse have witnessed an astonishing information  explosion. We have sought to bring together the accumulated data in this review.  An Historical Perspective traces the evolution from the now abandoned  ""pericardial"" or ""extracardiac"" phases, through the leafletchordal phase (redundancy), the myocardial phase (segmental left ventricular contraction  abnormalities), to the anular phase (dilatation and faulty systolic  contraction). Functional Anatomy is dealt with in terms of pathology, pathophysiology, hemodynamics, angiocardiography, echocardiography, and physical  and pharmacological interventions. Clinical Manifestations are concerned with  prevalence, natural history, symptoms, physical signs, electrocardiographic","28459942, 20698148, 10744765, 776440","LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets.

Give an overview of visualizing genomes with oligopaint FISH probes.,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This is achieved through Fluorescence In","Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This unit details how Oligopaint probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation, Context: It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome  activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently  attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased  efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the  genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid  researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop  application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures  so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate  levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and  scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome, Context:  MOTIVATION: Genome plotting is performed using a wide range of visualizations  tools each with emphasis on a different informative dimension of the genome.  These tools can provide a deeper insight into the genomic structure of the  organism. RESULTS: Here, we announce a new visualization tool that is specifically  designed for chloroplast genomes. It allows the users to depict the genetic  architecture of up to ten chloroplast genomes in the vicinity of the sites connecting the inverted repeats to the short and long single copy regions. The  software and its dependent libraries are fully coded in R and the reflected plot  is scaled up to realistic size of nucleotide base pairs in the vicinity of the, Context: Inherited Disease Panel. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to  amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA  fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors.  Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were  carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were  sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. Data from the PGM runs were  processed using an Ion Torrent Suite 3.2 software to generate sequence reads.  After sequence alignment and extraction of SNPs and indels, all the variants  were filtered against dbSNP137. DNA sequences were visualized with an Integrated Genomics Viewer. The most likely disease-causing variants were analyzed by  Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The PGM sequencing has yielded an output of 855.80 Mb, with a > 100 ×  median sequencing depth and a coverage of > 98% for the targeted regions in all the four samples. After data analysis and database filtering, one known missense  mutation (p.E1811K) and two novel premature termination mutations (p.E2264X and  p.L871FfsX23) in the FBN1 gene were identified in the three MFS patients.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,H4K20me1 is mediated by PR-Set7.,"Context: While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence  plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about  the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still  limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by  high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide  distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4  (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in  Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study  explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the  transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the  four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly  concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict  missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further, Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation, Context: modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This  histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and  biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from  histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and  immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with  active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition,  H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of  H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change. These  findings suggest its critical role on the regulation of chromatin functions, Context: The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional  histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone  modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where  nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and  have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using  public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal  in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression.  We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons  of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently  higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly  related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but  also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved  since it is present in both primates and nematodes","23355544, 27131378, 24681537, 19687145",Set7 is H4K20 monomethyltransferase.

What are the targets of pemigatinib?,"FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3.","Context:  Pemigatinib (PEMAZYRE™), a small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor  receptor (FGFR) 1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, received accelerated approval in April 2020  in the USA for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and a FGFR2 fusion or other  rearrangement, as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Developed by Incyte  Corporation, it is the first targeted treatment for cholangiocarcinoma in the USA.

Pemigatinib is also undergoing clinical development in  various countries worldwide for use in several other FGFR-driven malignancies  (e.g. solid tumour, urothelial carcinoma). This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of pemigatinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced  or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and a FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement, as  detected by a US FDA-approved test, Context: adverse event (irrespective of cause); the most frequent were hypophosphataemia  (18 [12%]), arthralgia (nine [6%]), stomatitis (eight [5%]), hyponatraemia  (eight [5%]), abdominal pain (seven [5%]), and fatigue (seven [5%]). 65 (45%)  patients had serious adverse events; the most frequent were abdominal pain  (seven [5%]), pyrexia (seven [5%]), cholangitis (five [3%]), and pleural  effusion (five [3%]). Overall, 71 (49%) patients died during the study, most  frequently because of disease progression (61 [42%]); no deaths were deemed to  be treatment related.

How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?,"HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. The variants","Context:  Genetic studies have identified common variants within the intergenic region  (HBS1L-MYB) between GTP-binding elongation factor HBS1L and myeloblastosis  oncogene MYB on chromosome 6q that are associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and alterations of other clinically important human erythroid  traits.

Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key  erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with  MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that, Context: Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression  should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes.  Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of  gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this  purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid  cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors.  Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes  expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the  gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin  mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed  gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a ""switching"" model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and  competition during fetal development.

Is avelumab effective for bladder cancer?,Yes. Avelumab has shown promising antitumor activity in patients with urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) and its dual mechanism of action could potentially produce synergistic clinical efficacy.,"Context: Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histologic type of bladder cancer. After  30 years of minimal progress in the treatment of advanced-stage disease, recent  advances in the genomic characterization of urothelial cancer and breakthroughs  in bladder cancer therapeutics have rejuvenated the field. Nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are among the exciting  recent novel therapeutic advances gaining approvals by the FDA for treatment of advanced-stage urothelial carcinoma. Yet the challenge for clinicians is to  determine the optimal choice of agents as first-line or second-line therapy and  which offers the best chance for overall survival for the individual patient in this rapidly changing field, Context: 17-DMAG was more effective than a combination of the two inhibitors specific for  the Akt and ERK pathways. Finally, the authors have confirmed that, though human  BCIC xenografts exhibited resistance to a single administration of CDDP and the  Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), 17-AAG  sensitized them to CDDP in a mouse model. These data encourage clinical trials  of Hsp90 inhibitors as they may improve therapeutic outcomes of CDDP-based  combination chemotherapy against advanced bladder cancer, Context: This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN  Guidelines) for Bladder Cancer focuses on systemic therapy for muscle-invasive  urothelial bladder cancer, as substantial revisions were made in the 2017  updates, such as new recommendations for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab,  durvalumab, and avelumab.

Similarly, before the advent of the immune  checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy.  In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been  reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being  investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review  the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led  to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management  of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy.

HER-2 belongs to what family of proteins?,The epidermal growth factor family.,"Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context:  Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease in a very high percentage of  patients. Despite new progress in endocrine and other systemic therapies, this  evidence remains challenging for patients and clinicians. HER2 protein is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of transmembrane receptors. HER2 is  overexpressed in approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers. Overexpression of  HER2 has been shown to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and relative resistance to some types of chemotherapy and hormonal therapies.  Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 protein, has  been shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for, Context: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to a family of  four transmembrane receptors involved in signal transduction pathways that  regulate cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression/amplification of HER2  is associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis in breast cancer. HER2 acts  as a networking receptor that mediates signaling to cancer cells, causing them  to proliferate. HER receptors exist as monomers but dimerize on ligand binding.  HER ligands are bivalent growth factor molecules whose low-affinity site binds  to HER2. No HER2-specific ligand has been identified but HER2 is the preferred  heterodimerization partner for other HER receptors. HER2-containing heterodimers are relatively long-lived and potent. HER3 has no inherent activity and is the  major and most potent dimerization partner of HER2. HER2 overexpression biases  the formation of HER2-containing heterodimers, leading to enhanced responsiveness to stromal growth factors and oncogenic transformation. Removal  of HER2 from the cell surface or inhibition of its intrinsic enzymatic activity  may reduce oncogenicity. Our research suggests that the antitumor efficacy of, Context: trastuzumab-like IgG. For simplification and to avoid methodological limitations  of synthesis and coupling chemistry, we herewith present a novel and optimized  approach by using adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as effective and high-density  mimotope-display system, which can be directly used for vaccination. METHODS: An AAV capsid display library was constructed by genetically  incorporating random peptides in a plasmid encoding the wild-type AAV2 capsid  protein. AAV clones, expressing peptides specifically reactive to trastuzumab,  were employed to immunize BALB/c mice. Antibody titers against human HER-2 were  determined, and the isotype composition and functional properties of these were tested. Finally, prophylactically immunized mice were challenged with human  HER-2 transfected mouse D2F2/E2 cells. RESULTS: HER-2 mimotope AAV-vaccines induced antibodies specific to human HER-2.

Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker.

Furthermore, it is possible to biochemically define the  relationships between BCL-2 family function and mitochondrial physiology using  isolated systems. Our laboratory uses freshly isolated mitochondria from  numerous sources to better understand BCL-2 family function and requirements for  BAK and BAX activation. Here, we will discuss commonly used in vitro techniques  to perform MOMP and cytochrome c release assays; and provide several key  methodologies to implicate BAK and BAX activity in these processes, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure  and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular  mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant  versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic  fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in  lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax  expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing  apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α  helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax  in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death.  Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a  connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Upregulated.  In the provided context, it is mentioned that MALAT-1 expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized.","Context: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumor associated with  asbestos exposure. There are few effective treatment options for mesothelioma,  and patients have a very poor prognosis with a median survival of < 12 months  from diagnosis. Biomarkers have been proposed as a cost-effective means of  cancer management, and the search for a mesothelioma biomarker has been ongoing  for the last 30 years. Many traditional soluble (glyco)protein biomarkers have  been evaluated over this time, and an ever-increasing list of new biomarkers,  including messenger RNA, DNA, microRNA, and antibodies, is being reported from  biomarker discovery projects. To date, soluble mesothelin is the only tumor biomarker to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use  in mesothelioma. Mesothelin is a glycoprotein normally expressed on the surface  of mesothelial cells, and in the cancerous state it can be present in circulation.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No. The context mentions that almost all RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance due to TR beta gene mutations, but does not mention any association with TR alpha1 mutations.","Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome of reduced tissue  responsiveness to thyroid hormone. To date, all individuals expressing the RTH  phenotype have been found to harbor mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene that impair T3-mediated function. We describe a unique  family in which the dominantly inherited RTH is not associated with  abnormalities in the TR beta or TR alpha genes, as determined by gene sequencing and linkage analysis. However, affected family members manifest a severe form of  RTH, with reduced responses of thyrotrophs and peripheral tissues requiring 8-  to 10-fold the normal replacement doses of L-T4 and L-T3. No other endocrine, Context:  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid  hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous  with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining  the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand  the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or  without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that  these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and, Context: Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear  thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are  transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression.  Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in  the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating  levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This  ""inappropriate"" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism,  where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually present with goiter and an euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid metabolic state.  Thus, pituitary resistance results in hypersecretion of TSH, which compensates,  at least in part, for hormone resistance in peripheral tissues. Despite this, Context:  Thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are a group of genetic conditions  characterized by decreased tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormones.

What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?,Interleukin-17a receptor.,"Context: The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream  signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving  role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a  potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in  clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies  such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646),  and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the  small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717.

List two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,Intrahepatic cholestasis and lymphedema of the lower extremities are the two most common symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome.,"Context: Aagenaes syndrome, also called Lymphedema Cholestasis Syndrome (LSC 1), is a  form of idiopathic familial intrahepatic cholestasis associated with lymphedema  of the lower extremities. It is named after the Norwegian pediatrician Oyestein  Aagenaes, who described the syndrome in 1968. The presence of lymphedema is  likely the predisposing factor for development of recurrent infections in such  patients.1 Recurrent cellulitis as such has never been described in the  literature with Aagenaes syndrome.

Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids.

We review all seven  published cases of AES in men for which details are available and compare the  age of onset, somatic manifestations, associated diseases and psychiatric  disturbances between the sexes. We emphasize that the criteria essential for a  diagnosis of AES should include typical clinical presentation, longstanding clinical history and a positive skin test with the patient's blood. Because of  the rarity of AES there is a lack of awareness regarding it among many doctors, Context:  We report a mother and daughter with features of Aagenaes syndrome.

What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?,"Autosomal dominant.   The context mentions that FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35 and states ""FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but the gene is not yet known."" It also says ""FSHD","Context: The discovery that expansion of unstable repeats can cause a variety of  neurological disorders has changed the landscape of disease-oriented research  for several forms of mental retardation, Huntington disease, inherited ataxias,  and muscular dystrophy. The dynamic nature of these mutations provided an  explanation for the variable phenotype expressivity within a family. Beyond  diagnosis and genetic counseling, the benefits from studying these disorders have been noted in both neurobiology and cell biology. Examples include insight  about the role of translational control in synaptic plasticity, the role of RNA  processing in the integrity of muscle and neuronal function, the importance of Fe-S-containing enzymes for cellular energy, and the dramatic effects of  altering protein conformations on neuronal function and survival. It is exciting  that within a span of 15 years, pathogenesis studies of this class of disorders, Context:  The diversity of hereditary pathology in 5 regions of Kostroma district was  studied. 32 nosological forms of autosomal dominant, 30 autosomal recessive and  7 X-linked recessive disorders were found. The most frequent autosomal dominant disorders were: neurofibromatosis, pigmentary degeneration of retina,  hypochondroplasia, ichtiosis, idiopathic scoliosis. The most frequent among the  autosomal recessive disorders were: oligophrenia, pigmentary degeneration of retina, muscular atrophy of juvenile Kugelberg--Welander type, congenital  cataract. The most frequent X-linked disorders were: muscular Duchenne type  dystrophy and hemophilia A. Analysis of mutant gene distribution over the, Context:  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the advances of knowledge in clinical, genetic  and epigenetic features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) allowed  the identification of two forms of FSHD, the classical autosomal dominant FSHD type 1, and FSHD type 2 characterized by an identical clinical phenotype but  associated with a different (epi)genetic defect. STATE OF THE ART: In the large majority of FSHD1 patients, the identification of D4Z4 pathogenic contraction on a permissive chromosome 4 is sufficient for  diagnosis, while FSHD2 diagnosis is complicated by the fact that the genetic  defect associated with this disease is not known yet and a complete D4Z4, Context:  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but  the gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, selective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study  was to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was  confirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and standardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle  biopsy). DNA analysis was based on EcoRI/BlnI restriction enzyme digestion  followed by hybridization with P13E-11 molecular probe.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,Yes. Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet in one study.,"Context: (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or  tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively.  Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma,  and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR  were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was  carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene,  chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were  significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice.  In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling  showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and  compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol  biosynthesis, HMGCR, Context: High dietary intakes of tomato products are often associated with a reduced risk  of CVD, but the atheroprotective mechanisms have not been established. This  study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary intake of  tomato products on plasma lipids and LDL oxidation. The diet intervention  included a baseline period, a 3-week low tomato diet (no tomato products  allowed) and a 3-week high tomato diet (400 ml tomato juice and 30 mg tomato  ketchup daily). Twenty-one healthy study subjects participated in the study.  Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL  cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet. The changes in total and LDL cholesterol  concentrations correlated significantly with the changes in serum lycopene (r  0.56, P = 0.009; r 0.60, P = 0.004, total and LDL, respectively), beta-carotene (r 0.58, P = 0.005; r 0.70, P < 0.001) and gamma-carotene concentrations (r  0.64, P = 0.002; r 0.64, P = 0.002).

A total of 27,261 women aged ≥45 y who were free of cardiovascular disease and  cancer provided relevant data for this study. Tomato-based food product intake  was modest, with 84% of women consuming <1 serving/d, but those with greater  intake had healthier lifestyle and dietary habits. Women consuming ≥10 compared  with <1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but  clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L;  P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P < 0.001) in multivariable models.

What is the indication for isradipine?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: Hypertension affects approximately 26% of the world's adult population and is a  recognized major risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with  cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. However, despite the  availability of a range of effective antihypertensive agents and a growing  awareness of the consequences of high blood pressure (BP), the treatment and  control of hypertension remains suboptimal. A number of patient subgroups are categorized as 'high risk' and may have hypertension that is more difficult to  treat, including obese individuals, patients with stage 2 hypertension, those  with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), patients with coronary artery disease or a history of stroke, and Black patients.

It is difficult to achieve the optimized renin  angiotensin aldosterone system suppression with currently available  antihypertensive agents, because ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics all activate the compensatory feedback mechanism that increases renin release and  increase plasma renin activity. The first orally active direct renin inhibitors  (DRIs) were developed in 1980s, including enalkiren, remikiren, and zankiren, Context: can prevent and control hypertension in many patients. An integrative approach  combining these lifestyle suggestions with the correct pharmacologic treatment  will best achieve new goal blood pressure levels, reduce cardiovascular risk  factors, improve vascular biology and vascular health, reduce cardiovascular  target organ damage and reduce healthcare expenditure. The expanded scientific  roles for nutraceutical supplements are discussed in relation to the prevention  and treatment of essential hypertension and cardiovascular diseases with  emphasis on mechanisms of action and clinical integration with drug therapy with  hypertension guidelines. It is the purpose of this paper to review only the hypertension clinical trials that have evaluated the clinical use and efficacy  of nutrition, weight loss, exercise and selected nutritional supplements,  vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Numerous clinical trials have evaluated the use of nutritional supplements such as beta carotene, selenium, vitamin C and  vitamin E in the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke yielding  conflicting results (positive, neutral and negative). In many of these clinical, Context: cardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no  catalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism. CRITICAL ISSUES: Large body of experimental data confirmed sustained beneficial  effects of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis activation on hypertension and  vascular injury. Experimental studies also suggest that activation of collectrin  might be beneficial in hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Their role in  clinical hypertension is unclear as selective and reliable activators of both  axes are not yet available. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: This review will highlight the results of recent research progress that illustrate the role of both ACE and collectrin in the modulation  of NO and oxidative stress in blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury,  providing evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ACE2 and collectrin in hypertension and vascular disease.

Which phosphatase is inhibited by LB-100?,Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).,"Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue.

Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?,"Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide. These three drugs make up the VAC regimen for treating Ewing's sarcoma.","Context:  Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14  patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The primary tumors were treated with radiation  therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Nine patients had no visible metastases at diagnosis: two died following the development of pulmonary metastases and the  rest have been free of disease for periods varying from 4 months to 4 1/2 years  following completion of treatment. This contrasts with a 27% survival in patients previously treated at this center with single agent chemotherapy. Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context: survival (OS) were 10 months (95% CI 6.2-13.8) and 14 months (95% CI 9.3-18.7),  respectively. Cumulative 2-year PFS and OS were 19.0% (95% CI, SD +/-8.4) and  32.7% (95% CI, SD +/-9.8), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with axial Ewing's sarcoma is dismal  despite an intensive, multimodality approach including multiagent, alternating  chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. A more aggressive approach should be  considered for this group of Ewing's sarcoma patients, Context: RECIST 1.1). The median time to disease progression was 5.7 weeks. Further  enrollment was therefore discontinued. No significant or unexpected toxicities  were observed with olaparib, with only a single case each of grade 3 anemia and  grade 3 thrombocytopenia observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a prospective phase II trial to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced  Ewing sarcoma after failure of standard chemotherapy. Olaparib administration  was safe and well tolerated when administered to this small heavily pre-treated  cohort at the 400 mg BID dose, although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 weeks. No significant responses or durable disease control was seen,  and the short average interval to disease progression underscores the  aggressiveness of this disease.

An 80% homology match to the Berget consensus sequence,  CA(C/T)TG, begins five nucleotides 3' of the major polyA site (used 20 times  more than the second, downstream polyA site) [Berget Nature 309, 179-182  (1984)]. The second AATAAA, located 73 nucleotides 3' of the first, directs  cleavage and polyadenylation 18 nucleotides downstream at a minor polyA site.  One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site. No matches to the Berget consensus sequence are located near this second, weaker polyA site, Context: CA(C/T)TG, begins five nucleotides 3' of the major polyA site (used 20 times  more than the second, downstream polyA site) [Berget Nature 309, 179-182  (1984)].

One match with 75% homology to the McLauchlan consensus sequence begins 17  nucleotides 3' of the second (weaker) polyA site. No matches to the Berget  consensus sequence are located near this second, weaker polyA site, Context: all of the mutant RNA is cleaved and polyadenylated at heterogeneous sites  approximately 100 nt upstream of the wild-type early polyadenylation site. In  addition, cells transformed by wild-type BPV harbor a small population of mRNAs  with 3' ends located in this upstream region. These experiments demonstrate that  inactivation of the major poly(A) signal induces preferential use of otherwise  very minor upstream poly(A) sites. Mutational analysis suggests that  polyadenylation at the minor sites is controlled, at least in part, by UAUAUA,  an unusual variant of the poly(A) consensus signal approximately 25 nt upstream  of the minor polyadenylation sites. These experiments indicate that inactivation of the major early polyadenylation signal is not sufficient to induce expression  of the BPV late genes in transformed mouse cells, Context: A compilation of the pre-mRNA ends of the genes of nuclear encoded mitochondrial  proteins resulted in a consensus sequence of the type (T/A)NTTNNNNNTTTNAATAAA.

Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?,Yes. It binds to phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells.,"Context:  Annexin V is a Ca(++)-binding protein which is widely used as a marker for  apoptotic cells, as it binds to the phosphatidylserine residues exposed at the  surface of apoptotic cells. In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic  thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in  tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated  with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of  the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content, Context: sub-populations in a heterogeneous cell population. Alkaline comet assay as  measured by single cell gel electrophoresis, on the other hand, accurately  measures DNA fragmentation on a single cell level and allows analysis of  subpopulation of cells. The assay was originally developed for measuring DNA  damage of cells exposed to any genotoxic agent. However, the comet image  generated by an apoptotic cell is different from that obtained with a cell  treated for a short time with a genotoxic agent. Correlation of comet formation  with various other established parameters of apoptosis is very important. The  present study aims to correlate different features of apoptosis with the formation of comet tail in human leukemia K-562 cells using tea extracts.  Apoptosis as measured by formation of apoptotic bodies, flow cytometric  analysis, activation of caspase 3 and 8, and expressions of apoptosis related genes such as bcl-2 and bax showed high degree of correlation with comet tail  moment. This indicates that comet assay can accurately reflect measure of DNA  fragmentation and hence can be used to detect a cell undergoing apoptosis, Context: Either inadequate or excessive apoptosis (programmed cell death) is associated  with many diseases. A method to image apoptosis in vivo, rather than requiring  histologic evaluation of tissue, could assist with therapeutic decision making  in these disorders. Programmed cell death is associated with a  well-choreographed series of events resulting in the cessation of normal cell  function, and the ultimate disappearance of the cell. One component of apoptosis is signaling adjacent cells that this cell is committing suicide by  externalizing phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane.  Annexin V, a 32-kDa endogenous human protein, has a high affinity for membrane-bound phosphatidylserine.

The aim of  this review is to assemble the current information on genetic mutations and  epigenetic disorders that affect genes during pancreatic carcinogenesis. We will  further discuss the interest of the genetic and epigenetic alterations for the  diagnosis and prognosis of PDAC. Large genetic alterations (chromosomal  deletion/amplification) and single point mutations are well described for  carcinogenesis inducers. Mutations classically occur within key regions of the  genome. Consequences are various and include activation of mitogenic pathways or  silencing of apoptotic processes. Alterations of K-RAS, P16 and DPC4 genes are frequently observed in PDAC samples and have been described to arise gradually  during carcinogenesis. DNA methylation is an epigenetic process involved in  imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. Alteration of DNA methylation patterns leads to deregulation of gene expression, in the absence of mutation. Both  genetic and epigenetic events influence genes and non-coding RNA expression,  with dramatic effects on proliferation, survival and invasion.

List proteins with HEAT repeats,The proteins listed in PRODOC with HEAT repeats are:  * CD44 * PARP1,"Context: organisms with complete genomic data, and all the SWISSPROT proteins obtained  from the Pfam database. All the entries in PRODOC are represented as a sequence  of functional domains, assigned using hidden Markov models, instead of as a  sequence of amino acids. On average 69% of the proteins in the proteomes and 49%  of the residues are covered by functional domain assignments. Software tools  allow the user to query the dataset with a sequence of domains and identify  proteins with the same or a jumbled or circularly permuted arrangement of  domains. As it is proposed that proteins with jumbled or the same domain  sequences have similar functions, this search tool is useful in assigning the overall function of a multi-domain protein. Unique features of PRODOC include  the generation of alignments between multi-domain proteins on the basis of the  sequence of domains and in-built information on distantly related domain families forming superfamilies. It is also possible using PRODOC to identify  domain sharing and gene fusion events across organisms.

Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results open up new avenues for the use of proteomics technologies in clinically relevant studies using archival  samples. Shotgun LC-MS/MS studies could serve to discover new biomarkers and may  provide clues to the genesis of TNBC and underlying molecular alterations, Context:  The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I  hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation. 5'HS3 contains six  G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity. Members of a protein family, characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in  transcription factor Sp1, interact with these motifs. Because point mutagenesis  cannot distinguish between family members, it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3. We show that the function of such closely related proteins can  be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid  changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF. Testing their activity in, Context: Domains are basic evolutionary units of proteins and most proteins have more  than one domain. Advances in domain modeling and collection are making it  possible to annotate a large fraction of known protein sequences by a linear  ordering of their domains, yielding their architecture. Protein domain  architectures link evolutionarily related proteins and underscore their shared  functions. Here, we attempt to better understand this association by identifying the evolutionary pathways by which extant architectures may have evolved. We  propose a model of evolution in which architectures arise through rearrangements  of inferred precursor architectures and acquisition of new domains. These pathways are ranked using a parsimony principle, whereby scenarios requiring the  fewest number of independent recombination events, namely fission and fusion  operations, are assumed to be more likely.

Does lucatumumab bind to CD140?,No. Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of CD40L with CD40.,"Context: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray  in Molt-4 cells before and after treatment of vorinostat. Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor, Context: understanding of these mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies.  Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that  modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted  to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS),  representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor  microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of  these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and  CD8+ T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency  than their matched CD161-negative counterparts. Interestingly, CD161+ CD4+ T  cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor, less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative  phenotype.

What is known about the effect of acupuncture in smoking cessation ?,"The treatment group showed a significant decrease in the nicotine withdrawal symptom score. However, there was no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between the treatment group (27.1%) and the control group (20.3%) at the end of treatment.","Context:  The use of alternative medicine for smoking cessation have been increasing  steadily in recent years. A series of clinical group studies was performed to  clarify the effect, outcome and success rate of an acupuncture treatment for smoking cessation. This study was conducted for four weeks using 238 smoking  students at 2 high schools. The subjects were separated into two groups: 159  students were treated with acupuncture on the anti-smoking acupoints of the ear, which is known to be effective for cessation of smoking (case group), and 79  students were treated at other sites of the ear (control group). The acupuncture  treatment was alternately administered at each side of the ears on a weekly, Context: treatment group showed a significant decrease in the nicotine withdrawal symptom  score.

There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups.  CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture.

Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality  for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using  auricular acupuncture for smoking cessation in 131 adults who wanted to stop smoking. Thirteen subjects withdrew from the study and 118 subjects were  included in the final analyses (mean age, 53.7 +/- 16.8 years; 100 males, 18  females).

Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient, Context:  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including  dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean  schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs, Context:  Monoamine oxidase membrane enzymes are responsible for the catalytic breakdown  of extra- and intracellular neurotransmitters and are targets for the  development of central nervous system drugs. We analyzed the dynamics of rat MAOA by performing multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations of  membrane-bound and membrane-free forms to clarify the relationship between the  mechanics of the enzyme and its function, with particular emphasis on the significance of membrane attachment. Principal component analysis of the  simulation trajectories as well as correlations in the fluctuations of the  residues pointed to the existence of three domains that define the global, Context: METHODS: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the  influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and  diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals:  20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. RESULTS: A group×genotype×abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018),  such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11  motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11  attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD.

Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?,Yes. Retroviruses are used in targeted transduction of specific cell types via combination with cell type-specific expression and targeted local administration to increase safety and efficiency of gene delivery.,"Context: could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of  transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally,  conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the  combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and  targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral  systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN)  retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol,  and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation  of replication competent retroviruses (RCR), Context: only can some genetically engineered adenoviral vectors achieve remarkably  efficient and specific gene delivery to target cells, but they also may act as  anticancer agents by selectively replicating within cancer cells.Due to the  great interest in using adenoviral vectors for various purposes, the need for a  comprehensive protocol for viral vector production is especially apparent.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"No. The context mentions that human tumour specific antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the molecular level, implying they are not originating from known protein coding genes.","Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: The identification of MHC-restricted and tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (CTLs) provides strong evidence in support of T cell-mediated immune  surveillance against human tumour cells. These CTLs recognize short peptides  derived from tumour-associated antigens in conjunction with class I molecules  expressed on tumour cells. In contrast to these observations there are now  numerous examples to suggest that a number of tumours escape this CTL-mediated  control either by down-regulating accessory molecules or by blocking the  intracellular processing of tumour-specific antigens. Recently a number of  tumour cell lines have been identified which display a transcriptional deficiency of transporters associated with antigen processing (also referred to  as TAP). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour, Burkitt's lymphoma  (BL), is a classic example in this category. In the present study we have restored class I-restricted antigen processing in a BL cell line by transfecting  a minigene expression vector encoding a CTL epitope derived from EBV linked to  an endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal sequence. These minigene, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: The immunohistological distribution of blood group (BG)-related antigens  including A, B, H type 2, and sialylated Lex in lung adenocarcinomas was  examined using monoclonal antibodies. BG-A, B, and H type 2 compatible with the  ABO status in tumor cells were expressed in 60% of the cases. Accumulation of H  type 2, associated with loss of BG-A and B, was observed in tumor cells of  patients with BG status other than 0.

Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?,I don't know the answer.,"Context:  Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) modifies proteins and peptides by transamidation  or deamidation of specific glutamine residues. TG2 also has a central role in  the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The enzyme is both the target of disease-specific autoantibodies and generates deamidated gliadin peptides  recognized by intestinal T cells from patients. Incubation of TG2 with gliadin  peptides also results in the formation of covalent TG2-peptide complexes. Here we report the characterization of complexes between TG2 and two immunodominant  gliadin peptides.

The 2.5 A crystal structure of  AlkA complexed to DNA shows a large distortion in the bound DNA. The enzyme flips a 1-azaribose abasic nucleotide out of DNA and induces a 66 degrees bend  in the DNA with a marked widening of the minor groove. The position of the  1-azaribose in the enzyme active site suggests an S(N)1-type mechanism for the glycosylase reaction, in which the essential catalytic Asp238 provides direct  assistance for base removal. Catalytic selectivity might result from the  enhanced stacking of positively charged, alkylated bases against the aromatic, Context: RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was  not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex  by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between  elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of  RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may  activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in  the enzyme's active site, Context: Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and  can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides.  Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most  critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with  both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides,  GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of  GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the  formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1.","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the  transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA  coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the  essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to  streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the  single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were  eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of  several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin  remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets. Thus, BirA-mediated tagging is an efficient approach for the direct  capture and characterization of transcription factor complexes, Context: tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites  around the β-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid  specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF  sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells  but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion  of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and  loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21  occupancy was reduced in the β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive  sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293  cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate  that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization, Context: CD4 T(h) are critical for orchestrating adaptive immune responses. The  expression of the transcription factor GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) is  up-regulated or down-regulated during T(h)2 or T(h)1 cell differentiation,  respectively. Furthermore, GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2  differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. In this review, we present  an updated view on the molecular mechanisms through which GATA3 regulates T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. During T(h)2 cell differentiation, GATA3 directly  binds to the T(h)2 cytokine gene locus at several regions and regulates  expression. On the other hand, GATA3 inhibits T(h)1 cell differentiation by preventing up-regulation of IL-12 receptor β2 and STAT4 (signal transducer and  activator of transcription 4) and neutralization of Runx3 (runt-related  transcription factor 3) function through protein-protein interaction.

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,Bats are thought to be the natural hosts of the virus that causes MERS.,"Context: Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)  has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures  against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We  describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on  host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV, Context:  A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be passed from animals to humans.  Zoonotic viruses may adapt to a human host eventually becoming endemic in  humans, but before doing so punctuated outbreaks of the zoonotic virus may be observed. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an example of such a disease. The  animal population in which the disease agent is able to reproduce in sufficient  number to be able to transmit to a susceptible human host is called a reservoir. There is little work devoted to understanding stochastic population dynamics in  the presence of a reservoir, specifically the phenomena of disease extinction  and reintroduction.

A number of previous  studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the  genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position  encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2).

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,Stress granules localize in the cytoplasm.,"Context: stained with FUS and the stress marker TIA-R. RESULTS: Fibroblasts from healthy controls and sporadic ALS cases showed a  prominent nuclear FUS expression. In the 2 FUS P525L mutation carriers, instead,  most cells showed a protein localization in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or  exclusively in the cytoplasm. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic  granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the  cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic FUS was recruited into stress granules, which showed a  time-dependent decrease in all subjects. However, in the FUS P525L fibroblasts,  the granules persisted longer, and they were more numerous than those detected in the cells from controls and sporadic ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in fibroblasts of FUS P525L mutation carriers, FUS  mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it redistributed into stress granules with likely a dose effect, i.e. a higher number of cells with granules, which persist  longer, than in controls and ALS cases. These data represent an early molecular  change occurring before ALS onset, suggesting a transient preaggregative state, Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability, Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of, Context: Mitochondrial fidelity is tightly linked to overall cellular homeostasis and is  compromised in ageing and various pathologies1-3. Mitochondrial malfunction  needs to be relayed to the cytosol, where an integrated stress response is  triggered by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α  (eIF2α) in mammalian cells4,5. eIF2α phosphorylation is mediated by the four  eIF2α kinases GCN2, HRI, PERK and PKR, which are activated by diverse types of  cellular stress6. However, the machinery that communicates mitochondrial  perturbation to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response  remains unknown1,2,7. Here we combine genome engineering and haploid genetics to unbiasedly identify genes that affect the induction of C/EBP homologous protein  (CHOP), a key factor in the integrated stress response. We show that the  mitochondrial protease OMA1 and the poorly characterized protein DELE1, together with HRI, constitute the missing pathway that is triggered by mitochondrial  stress. Mechanistically, stress-induced activation of OMA1 causes DELE1 to be  cleaved into a short form that accumulates in the cytosol, where it binds to and","29035885, 29129640, 25437551, 32132706",cytoplasm,"29298433, 23474818, 27057671, 25148713, 29035885, 28894257, 23982513, 22383896"
What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?,"A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.

CONCLUSION: A mutation or abnormality in the cyclic adenosine  monophosphate-response element-binding protein has previously been determined as  a cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. However, microdeletion of 16 p13.3  comprising cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein and  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 genes is a rare scenario in  the pathogenesis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Additionally, due to insufficient  coverage of the human genome by conventional techniques, clinically significant  genomic imbalances may be undetected in unexplained syndromic conditions of young children. This case report demonstrates the ability of array-based  comparative genomic hybridization to offer a genome-wide analysis at high  resolution and provide information directly linked to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome. This will contribute to more accurate genetic  counseling and provide further insight into the syndrome, Context: mandibular prognathia and dental malocclusion. Karyotype and interphase FISH  (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) was done in blood cells. Interphase FISH  was also performed on buccal epithelial cells. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated  trisomy 13 mosaicism in 25% cells i.e. 47, XX,+13(9)/46,XX(27). The interphase  FISH in blood cells showed trisomy 13 in 15%, whereas in buccal mucosa cells  showed nearly 6%. Mosaic aneuploidy in constitutional karyotype can be  responsible for variation in clinical and morphological presentation of patient  with genetic disorder, Context: We report on a female patient with an exceedingly rare combination of  achondroplasia and multiple-suture craniosynostosis. Besides the specific  features of achondroplasia, synostosis of the metopic, coronal, lambdoid, and  squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried  out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common  achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor  3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as  molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any  additional genetic alteration. It is suggested that this unusual phenotype is a result of variable expressivity of the common achondroplasia mutation, Context: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features:  early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow  progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and  X-linked inheritance.

Can the yeast protein Abf1 act as insulator?,Yes. The context mentions that four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity.,"Context: One of the dogmas of transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes suggests  the existence of transcriptional domains with no promoter-enhancer interactions  between them. Specific regulatory elements, known as insulators, block the  interaction between an enhancer and a promoter. Insulators are believed to act  as transcription domain boundaries. The review considers general properties of  well-known insulators identified in Drosophila and vertebrates. The mechanism of  action of insulators and their role in the regulation of gene expression are  discussed on the basis of available information, Context: As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and  revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To  investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed  phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced  nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster  together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans  and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are  present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in  the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common  vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more  derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead  operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes,, Context: described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains  spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display  autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains  either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that  insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also  contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously  involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators,  insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General  Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene  expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains, Context: One of the dogmas of transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes suggests  the existence of transcriptional domains with no promoter-enhancer interactions  between them.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes.  Hesperidin was shown to exert neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced toxicity in SK-N-SH cells by attenuating apoptosis, maintaining mitochondrial function, and inhibiting ROS generation. It also protected cultured cells against excitotoxic neuronal","Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.  Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective  effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, Context: downregulation of Aβ-stimulated autophagy could increase insulin-stimulated  neuronal glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment with hesperetin and hesperidin  improved Aβ-impaired glucose utilization by inhibiting Aβ-induced autophagy in  neuronal cells.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that downregulation of autophagy may be one  of the approaches to control the impairment of energy metabolism leading to  neuronal injury in the early development of Alzheimer's disease, and hesperetin  or hesperidin may be a potential agent in the preventing of Alzheimer's disease  progression, Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C.

The  purpose of this study was to assess whether PGI(2) analogues could affect T  helper (Th) cell responses in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and healthy  donors (HD). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33  patients with SSc and 29 HD. Cytokine levels in PBMC and monocyte/CD4 T cell  cultures were quantified by immunoassays.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"The NBEAL2 gene is implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome, with biallelic mutations identified. Additionally, a nonsense mutation in GFI1B was found to cause autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome. A G-to-A mutation","Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized  by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets. The  genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with  inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and α-granule deficiency. All  of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the α-granule content by  immunofluorescence analysis for α-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9  novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included, Context:  The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding  disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a  nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In  addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant  GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show  that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome,, Context: We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier  females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers  G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but  not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a  spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose that GATA1 is an upstream regulator of the genes required for platelet  alpha-granule biogenesis, Context:  We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a  sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia,  and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear.  Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included  the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759  corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.

Can acupuncture cause spinal epidural hematoma?,Yes. The context mentions that spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as acupuncture.,"Context:  Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control  procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although  it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed, Context: evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed  since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma, Context:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acupotomy is a modern type of acupuncture that uses a  blade-needle combined with a flat surgical scalpel at its tip. This study was  conducted to summarize and critically evaluate the current evidence on  acupotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All relevant studies up to February 19, 2019, were  included, through comprehensive searches in 11 electronic databases without  language restrictions. RESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews (SRs) comprising of 69 randomized controlled trials were included, and the methodological quality was medium-to-high in  AMSTAR. All the included studies reviewed musculoskeletal disorders and reported  a significantly higher total effective and cure rates in the acupotomy group for, Context: mean values for the age at which smoking started, smoking duration, daily number  of cigarettes smoked and nicotine dependent score. At the end of treatment,  cigarette consumption had significantly decreased in both groups, but only the  treatment group showed a significant decrease in the nicotine withdrawal symptom  score. Smoking cessation rate showed no significant difference between the  treatment group (27.1%) and the control group (20.3%) at the end of treatment.  There was also no significant difference in the smoking cessation rate between  the treatment group (16.6%) and the control group (12.1%) at the end of  follow-up. There were no major side effects of auricular acupuncture in both  groups. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better  efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture  with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking  cessation","21082060, 21082060, 31383431, 17698433","Yes, acupuncture can cause spinal epidural hematoma.","8456713, 21082060, 21289580, 27651774, 24094991, 25459742"
"In clinical trials, the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition, yes or no?","Yes.  The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep, with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations.","Context: CEP-26401 is a novel orally active, brain-penetrant, high-affinity histamine H3  receptor (H3R) antagonist, with potential therapeutic utility in cognition  enhancement. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation  studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg  once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine  samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge  Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal  polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was conducted on one CANTAB and one polysomnography parameter of interest. CEP-26401  was slowly absorbed (median tmax range 3-6 hours) and the mean terminal  elimination half-life ranged from 24-60 hours. Steady-state plasma, Context: concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose-  and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major  elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep,  with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model,  with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available  pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5 mg/day  with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.  Further clinical studies are required to establish the potential of low-dose CEP-26401 in cognition enhancement, Context: mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of  short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3  to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased  prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective  at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at  subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These  results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and  suggest that this novel H₃R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the  treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to  approved antipsychotics, Context: with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower  concentrations.
