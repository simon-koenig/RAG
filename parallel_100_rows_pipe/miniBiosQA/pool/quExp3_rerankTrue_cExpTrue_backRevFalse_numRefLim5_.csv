What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Yes, histone lysine methylation has significant implications in medulloblastoma. Recent studies have identified recurrent genetic events in genes targeting this modification, particularly at histone 3, lysine 9 (H3","Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2.

Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes  in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma.

Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.

Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution. The definition of  species-specific cGOFs provides powerful guidance for genome assembly and other  structure-based analysis, Context:  Altered oxidative metabolism is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., dNTP pool, as well as DNA is a major source of mutagenesis and  carcinogenesis.

What is ectopia lentis?,"No, the context does not provide information about ectopia lentis.  Ectopia lentis refers to a medical condition where the lens of the eye is not located in its normal position. The lens may be displ","Context: TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly  enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein  Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs  harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw)  predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do.  Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene  chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We  propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes  from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations and  find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of  inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin, Context: Inter-assay CV for t-tau was <5% and RE was within ±8%. For p-tau181,  inter-assay CV was <9% and RE was within ±2.5%. Total CV (intra-assay plus  inter-assay) were below 10% for both analytes. Up to 20-fold dilutional  linearity was demonstrated for both analytes. Stability of t-tau and p-tau181  was demonstrated in CSF during five freeze-thaw cycles at ≤-20 °C and ≤-70 °C  and at 18-22 °C for up to 24 h. Neither semagacestat nor solanezumab interfered  with either assay. Inter-individual t-tau and p-tau181 concentrations were  highly variable but intra-individual variations were small. These assays are  suitable for analysis of CSF t-tau and p-tau181 in a single laboratory supporting multi-center AD clinical trials. No effect of treatment with  semagacestat or solanezumab was observed in response to three months of drug  administration, Context: organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved  compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that  underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To  explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C  and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167,  DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between  TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly  enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein  Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of HNSCC and 2-year overall,  relapse-free and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Of the 754 patients in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry, 19  (3%) had HNSCC. This is a significantly higher incidence of HNSCC compared with  that observed in the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 500; 95%  confidence interval, 300-781) (P<.001).

Of the 19  patients, 10 (53%) developed locoregional recurrences within a median of 16 months from diagnosis. The median follow-up was 29 months.

Consequently, spine metastases from HCC are being  diagnosed more frequently. The accurate prediction of prognosis plays a critical  role in determining a patient's treatment plan, including surgery for patients  with spinal metastases of HCC. We investigated the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and prognostic factors of HCC presenting with spine metastases, in  patients who underwent surgery.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing. They silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity. In C. elegans, piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontranspos","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world, Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating, Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage, Context:  Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the entire transcriptome.

Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location.

The context mentions various approaches to derive essential genes and minimal gene sets for synthetic minimal genomes, but it does not specify a particular minimal genome that has","Context: As a key focus of synthetic biology, building a minimal artificial cell has  given rise to many discussions. A synthetic minimal cell will provide an  appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems  with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and  construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a  cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome. Kinds of approaches, based on bioinformatics and molecular biology, have been  developed and proceeded to derive essential genes and minimal gene sets for the  synthetic minimal genome. Experiments about streamlining genomes of model bacteria revealed genome reduction led to unanticipated beneficial properties,  such as high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant  genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Recent achievements in, Context: Single-cell prokaryotes represent a simple and primitive cellular life form. The  identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the  free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and  essence of life forms. The principles, methodology, and recent progresses in the  identification of essential genes and minimal genome and the creation of  synthetic cells are reviewed and particularly the strategies for creating the  minimal genome and the potential applications are introduced, Context: The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology  in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this  goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for  functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can  then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal  genome has not been discovered. This review analyzes the organisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pelagibacter ubique, Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Prochlorococcus  marinus as models of heterotrophic symbiont, heterotrophic free-living,  autotrophic symbiont and autotrophic free-living organisms respectively and compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most  closely resembles a true minimal genome.

Recent achievements in  chemical synthesis technology for large DNA segments together with the rapid  development of the whole-genome sequencing, have transferred synthesis of genes  to assembly of the whole genomes based on oligonucleotides, and thus created  strong preconditions for synthesis of artificial minimal genome. Here in this  article, we review briefly the history and current state of research in this  field and summarize the main methods for making a minimal genome. We also discuss the impacts of minimized genome on metabolism and regulation of  artificial cell, Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand.

RECENT FINDINGS: Protection against anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)  positive RA was shown to be associated wit DRB1*1301. Genome-wide association  studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci  associated with RA, so the list is now over 30. Typing for the known risk loci  is not helpful for prediction of the risk for RA. It is remarkable how few  functional studies have been published. SUMMARY: Known genetic factors explain 50-60% of the genetic variance for  susceptibility to ACPA-positive and 30-50% for ACPA-negative RA. Searching for  the remaining missing or hidden heritability is in all probability not going to yield much for prediction and/or targeted intervention.

However, obtaining a  complete catalog of cancer genes is difficult due to the heterogeneous molecular  nature of the disease and the limitations of available computational methods.  Here we show that the combination of complementary methods allows identifying a  comprehensive and reliable list of cancer driver genes. We provide a list of 291 high-confidence cancer driver genes acting on 3,205 tumors from 12 different  cancer types. Among those genes, some have not been previously identified as  cancer drivers and 16 have clear preference to sustain mutations in one specific tumor type. The novel driver candidates complement our current picture of the  emergence of these diseases. In summary, the catalog of driver genes and the  methodology presented here open new avenues to better understand the mechanisms  of tumorigenesis, Context: OBJECT: In the measurement of clinical outcome in pediatric patients with  hydrocephalus the condition's effects on a child's physical, emotional,  cognitive, and social health are frequently ignored.

METHODS: The standardized steps in the development of a health status measure  were followed. Item generation required involvement of health professionals and  focus groups with parents of children with hydrocephalus. A comprehensive list of 165 unique health status items was thus generated. To streamline the list,  questionnaires were sent to 69 sets of parents to solicit their opinions  regarding the most important of these health issues, and the 51 most significant items were then selected to represent the following health domains: physical,  social-emotional, and cognitive.

Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted  survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to  determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS: This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with  MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009  were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected, Context: 36 operations (three patients underwent surgical treatment twice) from February  2006 to December 2013.

RESULTS: Overall survival was not correlated with age, sex, level of metastases,  preoperative Child-Pugh classification, preoperative ambulatory function,  preoperative radiotherapy, type of operation, administration of Sorafenib, or  the Tokuhashi scoring system. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an  independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Comparing the Child-Pugh  classification and ambulatory ability, there were no statistically differences between patients pre- and post-operatively.

The  kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor,  ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an  essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family  members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause  developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown.

We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells.

Extrinsic apoptotic signaling is activated  in reovirus-infected neurons in vitro and in vivo, but the role of intrinsic  apoptosis signaling during encephalitis is largely unknown. Bax plays a key role  in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of  mitochondrial cytochrome c. We found Bax activation and cytochrome c release in neurons following infection of neonatal mice with T3 reoviruses. Bax(-/-) mice  infected with T3 Abney (T3A) have reduced central nervous system (CNS) tissue  injury and decreased apoptosis, despite viral replication that is similar to that in wild-type (WT) Bax(+/+) mice. In contrast, in the heart, T3A-infected  Bax(-/-) mice have viral growth, caspase activation, and injury comparable to  those in WT mice, indicating that the role of Bax in pathogenesis is organ, Context: function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the  nucleus to cytoplasm.

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations  implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,"No, according to the context, thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha1) mutations are not implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. Instead, TR alpha1 isoform may play a compensatory role in maintaining","Context: The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a  patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and  presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating  hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone  (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical  evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of  RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized  tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this  tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified  eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor  beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially  avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and  imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid, Context:  Three novel point mutations at nucleotides 1249, 1282, and 1614 (exons 9 and 10)  of the human thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene were observed in six individuals  affected by the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone.

This is explicitly stated in the text, which reports that ""Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific","Context: investigated in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor-initiating cells were isolated from primary GBM  tumors and expanded as neurospheres in vitro. The GBM tumor-initiating cells  were treated with imetelstat and examined for the effects on telomerase activity  levels, telomere length, proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation.  Subsequently, mouse orthotopic and subcutaneous xenografts were used to assess  the in vivo efficacy of imetelstat. RESULTS: Imetelstat treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase  (IC(50) 0.45 micromol/L). Long-term imetelstat treatment led to progressive telomere shortening, reduced rates of proliferation, and eventually cell death  in GBM tumor-initiating cells. Imetelstat in combination with radiation and  temozolomide had a dramatic effect on cell survival and activated the DNA damage response pathway.

Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?,"Yes, according to a study with rats, tomato juice can lower cholesterol levels. The study found that rats fed with tomato juice had significantly lower total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels compared to the","Context: diet compared to the low tomato diet. The changes in total and LDL cholesterol  concentrations correlated significantly with the changes in serum lycopene (r  0.56, P = 0.009; r 0.60, P = 0.004, total and LDL, respectively), beta-carotene  (r 0.58, P = 0.005; r 0.70, P < 0.001) and gamma-carotene concentrations (r  0.64, P = 0.002; r 0.64, P = 0.002). The level of circulating LDL to resist  formation of oxidized phospholipids increased 13 % (P = 0.02) in response to the  high tomato diet. In conclusion, a high dietary intake of tomato products had  atheroprotective effects, it significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels, and  increased LDL resistance to oxidation in healthy normocholesterolaemic adults.

What is the indication for isradipine?,"Yes, the context provides information about the indications for isradipine. Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine class, used to treat hypertension. It has limited effects on my","Context: dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa,  metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood  pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another  antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to  monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective  in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and  that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and  hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when  administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of  isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of  carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased  significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of  therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder, Context: immunosorvent assay (ELISA) kit. The production of type I collagen was assayed  by ELISA. Isradipine significantly enhanced the cell proliferation from the  second day of the culture period. Also, isradipine raised the level of bFGF in  the culture medium. The same concentration, also significantly enhanced the  production of type I collagen. In conclusion, we were able to prove that  isradipine causes the proliferation of cultured gingival fibroblasts as well as  other dihydropyridine-derivative Ca superset 2+ antagonists do. In order to  prevent the gingival overgrowth, it is advisable to be very careful in the use  of isradipine as a therapy for hypertension and other indications, Context: rate, preserves or enhances renal plasma flow, decreases renal vascular  resistance, maintains or reduces filtration fraction, and exerts a sustained  natriuretic effect, all of which may enable isradipine to slow the rate of  progression of renal deterioration. In addition, isradipine may decrease  proteinuria and may decrease glomerular capillary pressure by dilating both the  efferent and afferent arterioles. Unlike older calcium-channel blockers,  isradipine exhibits minimal cardiodepressant activity and is not associated with  any negative inotropic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and dosage  adjustments may not be necessary when administered to patients with renal insufficiency. Isradipine has a favorable renal effect profile and also has  several properties that meet the requirements of other patient populations where  an extra measure of antihypertensive safety is required, such as diabetics, dialysis patients, and transplant recipients. Side effects with isradipine are  usually mild and transient, occurring in a dose-dependent manner, Context: administered four times per day. An extemporaneous isradipine suspension was  used in 62% of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with isradipine alone  in 38 children; the remainder received isradipine in combination with additional  antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8+/-9 days  later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with isradipine treatment, with a  mean reduction of 14+/-13 mmHg for systolic BP and 13+/-15 mmHg for diastolic  BP. There was no effect of isradipine treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects  occurred in 9.5% of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing,  dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that isradipine successfully lowers BP in hypertensive children with secondary forms of hypertension. Use of isradipine  suspension allows infants and young children to be treated as readily as older  children, Context: BACKGROUND: Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine  class. It has limited effects on myocardial contractility; is available in a  powder-filled capsule and has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours.

Based on these  results we conclude that bovine brain and adipose tissue contain an identical  phosphoprotein inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (DARPP-32), which is distinct  from that of skeletal muscle (inhibitor-1), Context:  The cDNA encoding human brain protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (I-1) was  expressed in Escherichia coli. Following PKA phosphorylation at a threonine,  recombinant human I-1 was indistinguishable from rabbit skeletal muscle I-1 as a potent and specific inhibitor of the type-1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase  (PP1). N-Terminal phosphopeptides of I-1 that retained the selectivity of intact  human I-1 highlighted a functional domain that mediates PP1 inhibition.

N-Terminal phosphopeptides of I-1 that retained the selectivity of intact  human I-1 highlighted a functional domain that mediates PP1 inhibition.  Substituting alanine in place of threonine-36 eliminated I-1 phosphorylation by  PKA and its phosphatase inhibitor activity. An acidic residue was substituted in  place of the phosphoacceptor to produce I-1(T35D), a constitutive phosphate  inhibitor. I-1(T35D) was an equally effective inhibitor of PP1 and the type-2  phosphatase, PP2A. However, CNbr digestion of I-1(T35D) yielded an N-terminal  peptide that showed 100-fold increased specificity as a PP1 inhibitor. This provided new insight into a unique conformation of the phosphorylated I-1 that  accounts for selective inhibition of PP1 activity. Truncation of an active I-1  phosphopeptide identified an N-terminal sequence that was reduced in addition to threonine-35 phosphorylation to inhibit PP1 activity. Biosensor studies  demonstrated that PP1 bound to both Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated I-1 and  suggested that distinct elements of I-1 structure accounted for PP1 binding and, Context: Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when  phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of  inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1  was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In  contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by  phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the  concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not  Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by  protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings  and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I  metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of  diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the, Context: protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of these three substrates was  markedly (2-3 fold) increased by 5 microM okadaic acid. Calmodulin was found to  antagonize the action of okadaic acid on such phosphorylation.

Unexpectedly, inhibitor 2 was also found to markedly  decrease protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban as well  these other microsomal substrates. These results are consistent with the views  that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated  phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions,  calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is  also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A.

Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?,"Yes, a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of small  non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed with crucial functions in  fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and  differentiation. Disturbance of miRNA expression and function leads to  deregulation of basic cellular processes leading to tumorigenesis. A growing  body of experimental evidence suggests that human tumors have deregulated  expression of microRNAs, which have been proposed as novel oncogenes or tumor  suppressors. Recent studies have shown that microRNA expression patterns serve  as phenotypic signatures of different cancers and could be used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. A few studies have analyzed global microRNA  expression profiles or the functional role of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Here  we have reviewed the role of microRNAs in prostate carcinogenesis by summarizing the findings from such studies. In addition, recent evidence indicates that  dietary factors play an important role in the process of carcinogenesis through  modulation of miRNA expression, though such studies are lacking in regards to, Context: oncogenes, whose loss or overexpression respectively has diagnostic and  prognostic significance.

Five  other patients had demonstrable metastases at diagnosis: VAC chemotherapy  achieved complete regression of pulmonary metastases in three for 9, 9+ and 24+, Context:  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and  cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's  sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984,  these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial  chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1)  alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days  21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3), Context: We report a response to pazopanib in a 69-year-old man with heavily pre-treated  metastatic extraosseous Ewing sarcoma in addition to molecular profiling of his  tumor. To our knowledge, this case is the earliest to demonstrate activity of an  oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor in Ewing sarcoma. This case provides  rationale for adding a Ewing sarcoma arm to SARC024, a phase II study of  regorafenib, another multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with liposarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas (NCT02048371).

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a prospective phase II trial to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced  Ewing sarcoma after failure of standard chemotherapy. Olaparib administration  was safe and well tolerated when administered to this small heavily pre-treated  cohort at the 400 mg BID dose, although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 weeks. No significant responses or durable disease control was seen,  and the short average interval to disease progression underscores the  aggressiveness of this disease.

TRH had  no effect on myocardial contractility and MAP at 20 and 30 min post-treatment in rabbits pre-treated with the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg, 1 hr  before TRH treatment, iv), but the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine did  not affect these responses to TRH. Experiments in vitro show that although TRH (10(-3) to 10(-8) M) had no direct effects on the isolated heart, left atrium,  and aortic strip, it did potentiate the inotropic effects of isoprenaline and  dopamine on the left atrium. These results suggest that the antishock effects of, Context:  The effects of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on the contractility of  electrically stimulated and perfused isolated rat hearts were investigated. TRH  in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7 and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,, Context:  The inotropic effect of the physiological level of TRH on isolated guinea pig  cardiac muscle was studied using a force transducer and standard microelectrode  techniques. TRH increased the contractile force of muscles dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction in normal Tyrode and a high K+  (27 mM) solution. The positive inotropic effect of TRH was associated with an  augmentation of slow action potentials in high K+ solution and was reduced in the presence of diltiazem, verapamil, and manganese.

These data suggest that polyadenylation of mRNAs  is an ancient process, Context: Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at  their 3' ends. Here we show that polyadenylated 3' termini in three yeast  species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Debaryomyces  hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to, Context: We propose a novel, efficient and intuitive approach of estimating mRNA  abundances from the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Our  method, NEUMA (Normalization by Expected Uniquely Mappable Area), is based on  effective length normalization using uniquely mappable areas of gene and mRNA  isoform models. Using the known transcriptome sequence model such as RefSeq,  NEUMA pre-computes the numbers of all possible gene-wise and isoform-wise  informative reads: the former being sequences mapped to all mRNA isoforms of a  single gene exclusively and the latter uniquely mapped to a single mRNA isoform.  The results are used to estimate the effective length of genes and transcripts, taking experimental distributions of fragment size into consideration.  Quantitative RT-PCR based on 27 randomly selected genes in two human cell lines  and computer simulation experiments demonstrated superior accuracy of NEUMA over other recently developed methods. NEUMA covers a large proportion of genes and  mRNA isoforms and offers a measure of consistency ('consistency coefficient')  for each gene between an independently measured gene-wise level and the sum of, Context:  It is well known that nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 3' poly(A) tail.

Several methods have been developed for visualizing apoptotic cells  in vitro or in fixed tissues, but few tools are available for visualizing  apoptotic cells in live animals. Here we describe a genetically encoded  fluorescent reporter protein that labels apoptotic cells in live zebrafish  embryos. During apoptosis, the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed  on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The calcium-dependent protein  Annexin V (A5) binds PS with high affinity, and biochemically purified,  fluorescently labeled A5 probes have been widely used to detect apoptosis in vitro. Here we show that secreted A5 fused to yellow fluorescent protein  specifically labels apoptotic cells in living zebrafish. We use this fluorescent  probe to characterize patterns of apoptosis in living zebrafish larvae and to visualize neuronal cell death at single-cell resolution in vivo, Context: using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish  whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed  using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously  with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The  test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC-/PI-), apoptotic cells  (FITC+/PI-) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing  traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The  Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the  kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM  will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process","14666384, 14666384, 14666384, 20601526, 7622868","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"
Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any ultraconserved element associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context:  For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related, Context:  Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require transcriptional regulation to ensure  rapid proliferation that allows for self-renewal. However, the molecular  mechanism by which transcriptional factors regulate this rapid proliferation remains largely unknown. Here we present data showing that CIBZ, a BTB domain  zinc finger transcriptional factor, is a key transcriptional regulator for  regulation of ESC proliferation. Here we show that deletion or siRNA knockdown of CIBZ inhibits ESC proliferation. Cell cycle analysis shows that loss of CIBZ  delays the progression of ESCs through the G1 to S phase transition. Conversely,  constitutive ectopic expression of exogenous CIBZ in ESCs promotes proliferation, Context: The co-occupancy of Tcf3 with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog on embryonic stem cell (ESC)  chromatin indicated that Tcf3 has been suggested to play an integral role in a  poorly understood mechanism underlying Wnt-dependent stimulation of mouse ESC  self-renewal of mouse ESCs. Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as  the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signalling suggested Tcf3-β-catenin  activation of target genes would stimulate self-renewal, here we show that an  antagonistic relationship between Wnt3a and Tcf3 on gene expression regulates  ESC self-renewal. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 replaced the requirement for  exogenous Wnt3a or GSK3 inhibition for ESC self-renewal, demonstrating that inhibition of Tcf3 repressor is the necessary downstream effect of Wnt  signalling. Interestingly, both Tcf3-β-catenin and Tcf1-β-catenin interactions  contributed to Wnt stimulation of self-renewal and gene expression, and the combination of Tcf3 and Tcf1 recruited Wnt-stabilized β-catenin to Oct4 binding  sites on ESC chromatin. This work elucidates the molecular link between the  effects of Wnt and the regulation of the Oct4/Sox2/Nanog network, Context:  Numerous chromatin regulators are required for embryonic stem (ES) cell  self-renewal and pluripotency, but few have been studied in detail. Here, we  examine the roles of several chromatin regulators whose loss affects the pluripotent state of ES cells. We find that Mbd3 and Brg1 antagonistically  regulate a common set of genes by regulating promoter nucleosome occupancy.  Furthermore, both Mbd3 and Brg1 play key roles in the biology of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC): Mbd3 colocalizes with Tet1 and 5hmC in vivo,  Mbd3 knockdown preferentially affects expression of 5hmC-marked genes, Mbd3  localization is Tet1-dependent, and Mbd3 preferentially binds to 5hmC relative, Context:  Embryonic stem (ES) cells offer insight into early developmental fate decisions,  and their controlled differentiation may yield vast regenerative potential. The  molecular determinants supporting ES cell self-renewal are incompletely understood. The homeodomain proteins Nanog and Oct4 are essential for mouse ES  cell self-renewal.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is suggested by genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability due to defective genes critical for maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context: to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of  dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have  tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce  apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved  complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these  lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an  overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of  DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited  or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to  radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair  and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer, Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: Brca1 deficiency leads to the development of breast cancer. We previously found  that Brca1 deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway. Reduced expression of  Brca1 was highly correlated with increased activated Akt in human breast cancer  samples. Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in  Brca1-deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. Defective homologous  recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to tumorigenesis in Brca1 deficiency. Here, we show that Akt1 promotes chromosome instability in  Brca1-deficent cells. DNA breaks in Brca1-deficent cells are aberrantly joined  into complex chromosome rearrangements by a process dependent on Akt1. Depletion of Akt1 increases HR in Brca1-mutant cells, which is rescued by expression of  wild-type, but not mutant Akt1 with deletion of Brca1-binding domain.

A  second Drosophila gene of this family has also been found. It is thus likely  that msl-3-like genes are present in all eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses  suggest that msl-3 is orthologous to the mammalian MSL3L1 genes, while the  second Drosophila melanogaster gene (which we have called Dm MRG15) is  orthologous to mammalian MRG15. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent  duplication occurred in plants.

The structure exhibits five canonical HEAT repeats along with  an extended 31-amino-acid loop (loop 8) between the fourth and fifth repeat that  is conserved within closely related Symplekin sequences. Molecular dynamics  simulations of this domain show that the presence of loop 8 dampens correlated  and anticorrelated motion in the HEAT domain, therefore providing a neutral  surface for potential protein-protein interactions. HEAT domains are often  employed for such macromolecular contacts. The Symplekin HEAT region not only  structurally aligns with several established scaffolding proteins, but also has been reported to contact proteins essential for regulating 3'-end processing.  Together, these data support the conclusion that the Symplekin HEAT domain  serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions essential to the mRNA  maturation process, Context: The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the  nuclear transport of proteins.

Risk factors  include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular  melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases.  Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy,  phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, many tumour specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein coding genes. These antigens arise due to somatic mutations in these genes, which can result in the production of neoantigens that were not previously seen","Context: The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype.  Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins. Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will, Context: SUMMARY: Somatic mutations and gene fusions can produce immunogenic neoantigens  mediating anticancer immune responses. However, their computational prediction  from sequencing data requires complex computational workflows to identify  tumor-specific aberrations, derive the resulting peptides, infer patients' Human  Leukocyte Antigen types and predict neoepitopes binding to them, together with a  set of features underlying their immunogenicity. Here, we present nextNEOpi (nextflow NEOantigen prediction pipeline) a comprehensive and fully automated  bioinformatic pipeline to predict tumor neoantigens from raw DNA and RNA  sequencing data. In addition, nextNEOpi quantifies neoepitope- and patient-specific features associated with tumor immunogenicity and response to  immunotherapy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: nextNEOpi source code and documentation are  available at https://github.com/icbi-lab/nextNEOpi, Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already, Context: levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss. Mechanisms inducing aberrant expression are numerous. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that an  abnormal content in surface class I/beta 2m may be associated with other aspects  of dedifferentiation of the tumour and hence may eventually correlate with, Context: Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already  'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins.  Tumour-specific antigens, which could be a more potent target for immunotherapy,  mostly arise by point mutations and have the disadvantage of being not only  tumour-specific, but also individual-specific. Therapeutic vaccination will probably focus on defined antigens offered as protein, peptide or nucleic acid.  Irrespective of the form in which the antigen is applied, emphasis will be given  to the activation of dendritic cells as professional antigen presenters. Dendritic cells may be loaded in vitro with antigen, or, alternatively,  initiation of an immune response may be approached in vivo by vaccination with  RNA or DNA, given as such or packed into attenuated bacteria.

Which gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome?,"Yes, the TWIST gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in craniofacial development and bone morphogenesis. Mutations in","Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome  7p21.2. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a  new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears  to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as  a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome. As a consequence we advise to routinely perform mutation analysis of the FGFR1, 2, and 3 genes in children with  non-syndromic trigonocephaly, Context:  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a relatively common craniosynostosis disorder with  autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified  in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The TWIST gene product is a transcription factor with DNA binding and helix-loop-helix domains. Numerous  missense and nonsense mutations cluster in the functional domains, without any  apparent mutational hot spot. Two novel point mutations and one novel polymorphism are included in this review. Large deletions including the TWIST  gene have been identified in some patients with learning disabilities or mental  retardation, which are not typically part of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Context: The authors describe on a Brazilian girl with coronal synostosis, facial  asymmetry, ptosis, brachydactyly, significant learning difficulties, recurrent  scalp infections with marked hair loss, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E.  Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in  7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex  Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with  phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four  other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of  six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31.

The gene deletions and numerous nonsense mutations are suggestive of haploinsufficiency as the  disease-causing mechanism. No genotype phenotype correlation was apparent, Context: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common craniosynostosis syndromes.  It is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with variable expression that  is caused by germline mutations in the TWIST1 gene or more rarely in the FGFR2  or FGFR3 genes. We have previously reported that patients with Saethre-Chotzen  syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here we have  analysed a cohort of 26 women with BRCA1/2-negative hereditary breast cancer to  study whether a proportion of these families might have mutations in  Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes. DNA sequence analysis of TWIST1 showed no  pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence in any of the 26 patients. MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification)-analysis also showed no  alterations in copy numbers in any of the craniofacial disorder genes MSX2,  ALX4, RUNX2, EFNB1, TWIST1, FGFR1, FGFR2,FGFR3, or FGFR4.

CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of, Context: BACKGROUND: With the advancement in high-throughput technologies, researchers  can simultaneously investigate gene expression and copy number alteration (CNA)  data from individual patients at a lower cost. Traditional analysis methods  analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn  diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and  inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible  approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in  the same individual. RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple  input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two  real microarray datasets demonstrated that the CNA-driven genes identified by  the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a  genomic region with CNA. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC  package showed better performance, Context: tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One  explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to  systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at  different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for  batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm  implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides  allele-specific estimates of copy number.

We sought for non-coding variants to  determine the clinical validity of common CADD scores.  METHODS: We evaluated 12,391 unique SNVs in 624 patient samples submitted for  germ-line mutation testing in a cancer-related gene panel. Stratifying by  genomic region, we compared the distributions of CADD scores of rare SNVs, SNVs  common in our patient population, and the null distribution of all possible  SNVs. RESULTS: The median CADD scores of intronic and nonsynonymous variants were  significantly different between rare and common SNVs (P < 0.0001). Despite these different distributions, no individual variants could be identified as plausibly  causative among the rare intronic variants with the highest scores. The  receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for noncoding variants is modest, and the positive predictive value of CADD for  intronic variants in panel testing was found to be 0.088.

Recently,  repeat elements present in the introns or 3'-UTRs of 15 human brain RNAs have  been shown to be targets for multiple adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing.  Using a statistical approach, we find that editing of transcripts with embedded  Alu sequences is a global phenomenon in the human transcriptome, observed in  2674 ( approximately 2%) of all publicly available full-length human cDNAs (n =  128,406), from >250 libraries and >30 tissue sources. In the vast majority of  edited RNAs, A-to-I substitutions are clustered within transcribed sense or antisense Alu sequences. Edited bases are primarily associated with retained  introns, extended UTRs, or with transcripts that have no corresponding known  gene. Therefore, Alu-associated RNA editing may be a mechanism for marking nonstandard transcripts, not destined for translation","24163250, 24163250, 24163250, 24163250, 15342557","RADAR is a rigorously annotated database of A-to-I RNA editing.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA1 are FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300, PU.1, Ski, LMO2-C, and LDB","Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This, Context: and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism  underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski  interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using  a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding  is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of  repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes. We propose that Ski  cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering  with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia, Context: The Ski oncoprotein dramatically affects cell growth, differentiation, and/or  survival. Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways  including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta,  and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on  Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In  particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid  progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia.

METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay  (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells.  RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had comparable binding affinities to LDB1 with LMO2-L, and over expression of LMO2-C  prevented LMO2-L from binding to LDB1, the inhibition rate being (81.13 +/-  0.68)%. RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of GPA was reduced [(51.00 +/- 1.58)%] in K562 cells while LMO2-C overexpressed. CONCLUSION: LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and  down regulates the expression of GPA, Context: a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction  is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block  erythroid differentiation.

Which proteins does RG-7992 target?,"No, the context does not provide information about RG-7992. The context only mentions RG7112 as a MDM2 inhibitor that targets p53 wild-type (WT) in pediatric","Context: The bacterial genus Corynebacteria contains several pathogenic species that  cause diseases such as diphtheria in humans and ""cheesy gland"" in goats and  sheep. Thus, identifying new therapeutic targets to treat Corynebacteria  infections is both medically and economically important. CG2496, a functionally  uncharacterized protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum, was evaluated using an  NMR ligand-affinity screen. A total of 11 compounds from a library of 460  biologically active compounds were shown to selectively bind CG2496 in a highly  conserved region of the protein. The best binder was identified to be  methiothepin (KD =54 ± 19 µM), an FDA-approved serotonin receptor antagonist. Methiothepin was also shown to inhibit the growth of C. glutamicum, but not  bacteria that lack CG2496 homologs. Our results suggest that CG2496 is a novel  therapeutic target and methiothepin is a potential lead compound or structural scaffold for developing new antibiotics specifically targeting Corynebacteria, Context: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence  of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. PROCEDURES: RG7112 and its inactive enantiomer RG7112i were evaluated against  the 23 cell lines of the PPTP in vitro panel using 96 hours exposure (1 nM to 10  µM). It was tested against the PPTP in vivo panel focusing on p53 wild-type (WT)  xenografts at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days followed by 4 weeks of  observation. Response outcomes were related to MDM2 and p53 expression datasets  (http://pptp.nchresearch.org/data.html). RESULTS: RG7112 demonstrated cytotoxic activity with a lower median IC(50) for p53 WT versus p53 mutant cell lines (approximately 0.4 µM vs. >10 µM,  respectively). RG7112 induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for  intermediate activity (EFS T/C > 2) in 10 of 26 (38%) solid tumor xenografts. Objective responses included medulloblastoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms,  rhabdoid and Ewing sarcoma xenografts. For the ALL panel, there was one partial  response, five complete responses and one maintained complete response. The ALL, Context: binding of a tritiated analog of MK-0974 on human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC)  membranes and rhesus cerebellum. [(3)H]MK-0974 displayed reversible and  saturable binding to both SK-N-MC membranes and rhesus cerebellum with a K(D) of  1.9 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively. Agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor  displaced [(3)H]MK-0974 in a concentration-dependent manner in competition  binding experiments. Both CGRP and adrenomedullin demonstrated biphasic  competition while MK-0974 and the peptide antagonist CGRP(8-37) displaced  [(3)H]MK-0974 in a monophasic fashion. In competitive binding studies with  [(3)H]MK-0974 and CGRP, the fraction of high-affinity binding was reduced significantly by incubating the membranes with GTPgammaS. In kinetic binding  experiments, the off-rate of [(3)H]MK-0974 was determined to be 0.51 min(-1)  with a half-life of 1.3 min. In conclusion, the radioligand [(3)H]MK-0974 has proven to be a useful tool for studying the binding characteristics of MK-0974  and has broadened our understanding of this promising molecule, Context: recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in  the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to this  epigenetic approach, pitolisant as G-protein coupled histamine H3 receptor (H3R)  antagonist has demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for Prader-Willi  syndrome. To combine these pioneering principles of drug action, we aimed to  identify compounds that combine both activities, guided by the pharmacophore  blueprint for both targets. However, pitolisant as selective H3R inverse agonist  with FDA and EMA-approval did not show the required inhibition at G9a.  Pharmacological characterization of the prominent G9a inhibitor A-366, that is as well an inhibitor of the epigenetic reader protein Spindlin1, revealed its  high affinity at H3R while showing subtype selectivity among subsets of the  histaminergic and dopaminergic receptor families. This work moves prominent G9a ligands forward as pharmacological tools to prove for a potentially combined,  symptomatic and causal, therapy in PWS by bridging the gap between drug  development for G-protein coupled receptors and G9a as an epigenetic effector in, Context: the N-terminal domain of CLR in antagonist binding, no specific residues have  been identified.

In addition, we confirm that the Trp-74-Lys mutation at human RAMP1  reduces BIBN4096BS affinity by over 300-fold and show for the first time a  similar effect for MK-0974 affinity. The data suggest that the non-peptide  antagonists occupy a binding site close to the interface of the N-terminal  domains of CLR and RAMP1","24403054, 22753001, 19084002, 32782417, 19914210",BFKB8488A is a bispecific antibody against FGFR1 and KLB.,33139537

With the recent progress in  genome-wide technologies, the genomic landscapes of enhancers have been broadly explored in mammalian genomes, which led to the discovery of novel specific  subsets of enhancers, termed super-enhancers. Super-enhancers are large clusters  of enhancers covering the long region of regulatory DNA and are densely occupied by transcription factors, active histone marks, and co-activators. Accumulating  evidence points to the critical role that super-enhancers play in cell  type-specific development and differentiation, as well as in the development of, Context: Alterations in GABAergic mRNA expression play a key role for prefrontal  dysfunction in schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disease. Here, we show  that histone H3-lysine 4 methylation, a chromatin mark associated with the  transcriptional process, progressively increased at GAD1 and other GABAergic  gene promoters (GAD2, NPY, SST) in human prefrontal cortex (PFC) from prenatal  to peripubertal ages and throughout adulthood. Alterations in schizophrenia included decreased GAD1 expression and H3K4-trimethylation, predominantly in  females and in conjunction with a risk haplotype at the 5' end of GAD1.  Heterozygosity for a truncated, lacZ knock-in allele of mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), a histone methyltransferase expressed in GABAergic and other cortical  neurons, resulted in decreased H3K4 methylation at GABAergic gene promoters.

The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two  coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells, Context: mechanistic regulation of this process, we applied an unbiased, quantitative,  single-cell-resolution image analysis pipeline to analyze embryos lacking or  exhibiting reduced levels of GATA6. We find that Gata6 mutants exhibit a  complete absence of PrE and demonstrate that GATA6 levels regulate the timing  and speed of lineage commitment within the ICM. Furthermore, we show that GATA6  is necessary for PrE specification by FGF signaling and propose a model where  interactions between NANOG, GATA6, and the FGF/ERK pathway determine ICM cell  fate. This study provides a framework for quantitative analyses of mammalian  embryos and establishes GATA6 as a nodal point in the gene regulatory network driving ICM lineage specification, Context: A substantial fraction of phenotypic differences between closely related species  are likely caused by differences in gene regulation.

We provide evidence for  genetic interactions between SUS1 and genes coding for components of P-bodies  such as PAT1, LSM1, LSM6 and DHH1. We demonstrate that SUS1 deletion is  synthetic lethal with 5'-->3' decay machinery components LSM1 and PAT1 and has a  strong genetic interaction with LSM6 and DHH1. Interestingly, Sus1  overexpression led to an accumulation of Sus1 in cytoplasmic granules, which can  co-localise with components of P-bodies and stress granules. In addition, we  have identified novel physical interactions between Sus1 and factors associated  to P-bodies/stress granules. Finally, absence of LSM1 and PAT1 slightly promotes the Sus1-TREX2 association.

Some  publications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. Our molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses  might also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy. AIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from heart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of  dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle, Context:  Coxsackie B viruses (types 1 to 5) are the most frequent reported cause of acute  viral myocarditis. To study the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular  level, we simulated an infectious situation by infecting cultured human foetal heart cells with Coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus.

Both  women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory  distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal  membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the  other recovered without any long-term consequence. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if  myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant  association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased  risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. This highlights the need for health care providers to increase awareness amongst caregivers to  target this 'at risk' group aggressively with vaccination and prompt treatment, Context: whether CMR visualizes areas of active myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy was  taken from the region of contrast enhancement and submitted to histopathologic  analysis.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"No, the context does not provide information about the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. The context mainly focuses on the correlation of thyroid hormones with echocardiographic parameters and subsequent mort","Context:  BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in thyroid function are frequent in patients with  heart failure and are associated with increased mortality. However, the relation  between thyroid hormone levels and echocardiographic parameters has not been investigated sufficiently. AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlations of thyroid  hormone levels with echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate their  associations with subsequent mortality in a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones were measured in 111 consecutive  patients with DCMP (35 female, 76 male, mean age: 62+/-12 years). All patients, Context: RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports, Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies  have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical  hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3), Context: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur.

We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-α gene  expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological  function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured, Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 µl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused  oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted  super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial, Context: AIMS: There is increasing evidence showing that mild traumatic brain injury  (mTBI) is associated with increased depression-related disorders in humans.  Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural  flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury  and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its  neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse  model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the  antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid. MAIN METHODS: Ten days after mTBI-induction, mice received oral hesperidin  treatment (50 mg/kg/14 days), then animals were subjected to different  depression tests including sucrose preference test, forced swim test,, Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line, Context: xanthine oxidase. In addition, it was shown to attenuate the excitotoxic  neuronal damage induced by excess glutamate in the cortical cultures. When the  excitotoxicity was induced by the glutamate receptor subtype-selective ligands,  only the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced toxicity was selectively and markedly  inhibited by hesperetin. Furthermore, hesperetin protected cultured cells  against the A(beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. Hesperidin, however, exerted  minimal or no protective effects on the neuronal damage tested in this study.

The effect of Wnt pathway  on osteogenesis relies on their cellular environment and the expression of  target genes. However, the molecular mechanism of that remains unclear. On the  basis of the preliminary results, we observed the contrary effect of canonical  Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in the different culture environment. Furthermore, we found that the  expression level of miR-17 was also varied with the change in the culture  environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-17 and canonical Wnt signaling may have potential interactions, particularly the inner regulation relationship  in different microenvironments.

In addition, current and future therapeutic  developments by the inhibition of further molecular targets are discussed in  this setting, Context:  Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are believed to have positive  effects on neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis in adult  brain. However, the downstream molecular targets of class I HDAC inhibitors in neurons are not clear. Although class I HDAC inhibitors are thought to broadly  promote transcription of many neuronal genes through enhancement of histone  acetylation, the affected gene set may include unidentified genes that are essential for neuronal survival and function. To identify novel genes that are  targets of class I HDAC inhibitors, we used a microarray to screen transcripts  from neuronal cultures and evaluated changes in protein and mRNA expression, Context: in human colon tumor (HCT) cells in vitro. All compounds inhibited the  topoisomerase (TOPO) II-mediated decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) in a  dose-dependent manner. The pyridoacridines' ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated  decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability  to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of  the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by  which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Incorporation  studies show that pyridoacridines disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis with little  effect on protein synthesis. It appears that DNA is the primary cellular target of the pyridoacridine alkaloids. These results are consistent with those for  known DNA intercalators, Context: acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome  side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to  suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or  antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of  MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs,  (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that  specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands  generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably  separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP  antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce  analgesia with reduced tolerance.

List mutations that are implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome.,"Yes, there are several mutations implicated in the Gray Platelet Syndrome (GPS) according to the provided context. These include biallelic mutations in NBEAL2 and a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding","Context: platelet α-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be  asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and  significant reduction of the α-granule content. However, they were not  thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2  alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their  platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower  severity of the α-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated  alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet  syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with α-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening  of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe  reduction of the α-granules.

Sections are included on the clinical phenotypes of, Context: Metabolic activation of a drug leading to reactive metabolite(s) that can  covalently modify proteins is considered an initial step that may lead to  drug-induced organ toxicities. Characterization of reactive metabolites is  critical to designing new drug candidates with an improved toxicological  profile. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass  spectrometry (MS) predominates over all analytical tools used for screening and  characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research, Context: INTRODUCTION: Reactive metabolite-mediated toxicity is frequently limited to the  organ where the electrophilic metabolites are generated. Some reactive  metabolites, however, might have the ability to translocate from their site of  formation. This suggests that for these reactive metabolites, investigations  into the role of organs other than the one directly affected could be relevant  to understanding the mechanism of toxicity. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the physiological and biochemical factors  that can enable reactive metabolites to cause toxicity in an organ distal from  the site of generation. Furthermore, the authors present a case study which describes studies that demonstrate that S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine  sulfoxide (DCVCS) and N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide  (N-AcDCVCS), reactive metabolites of the known trichloroethylene metabolites, Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity. Achalasia involves difficulty swallowing due to impaired relaxation","Context: gene, located on chromosome 12q13. We describe a 42-year-old patient who  presented with neuropathy and was found to have alacrima, achalasia, mild  autonomic dysfunction with significant central and peripheral nervous system  involvement. She was later diagnosed with oligosymptomatic triple A syndrome.  Sequencing of the AAAS gene identified two heterozygous mutations within exon 14  and its donor splice site (p.L430F-c.1288C>T and c.1331+1G>T), one of which is  novel. Allgrove syndrome should be suspected in patients with neurological  impairment associated with two or more of the main symptoms (alacrima, achalasia  or adrenal insufficiency), Context:  Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare disease, and  presents mainly in children. Its cardinal symptoms are achalasia, alacrima, and  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity. We report three cases of Triple A syndrome. Our aim is to inform pediatric surgeons about the existence  of this rare syndrome and to highlight the need for suspicion of alacrima and  ACTH insensitivity in cases of pediatric achalasia. Triple A syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with achalasia. Alacrima should be  investigated by a Schirmer test, and adrenal dysfunction should be tested in  cases of suspected triple A, Context: frequently associated with neurological manifestations like polyneuropathy.  Since its first description by Allgrove in 1978, approximately 100 cases have  been reported in the literature. Here we report an 18-year-old boy diagnosed as  having Allgrove syndrome, with ACTH resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia,  alacrimia, and severe motor polyneuropathy. Alacrimia was the earliest feature  evident at the age of 8 years. He presented with achalasia and adrenal  insufficiency at 12 and 18 years respectively and developed neurological  symptoms in the form of severe muscle wasting at the age of 15 years. Patients  with Allgrove syndrome usually manifest adrenal insufficiency and achalasia during first decade of life. Our patient manifested adrenal insufficiency and  achalasia in the second decade and manifested neurological dysfunction before  adrenal dysfunction, Context:  Allgrove syndrome (triple A syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder  characterised by adrenocortical insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. Patients  also suffer from diverse neurological disorders. Allgrove syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene located at chromosome 12q13, which encodes for a  tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein (aladin). The exact function of  this protein is still not known, Context: achalasia besides ACTH resistance. The girl was born to consanguineous parents.  Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome. Mutation  analysis revealed a novel homozygous deletion of a single G, c.771delG, in exon  8 of the AAAS gene. This frame shift mutation was predicted to create a  premature stop codon at locus 290, p.R258GfsX33, leading to a truncated and  non-functioning aladin protein. Both the parents were heterozygous for the  mutation.  CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations and AAAS gene mutations analysis  confirmed the diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome. Gene analysis indicated that this  syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherent disorder. ALADIN is significant for the normal cell function. When compared with reported cases, it seems that there  are no remarkable relation between gene mutation loci and clinical  manifestations in Allgrove syndrome","20051279, 27385299, 26354489, 12497758, 17880786","Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardinal features of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrimia.

Neuropsychological testing covered the domains of attention,  learning and memory, executive functions, visual perception, and language.  Performance was analyzed at baseline and after 1 year of continuous DBS. RESULTS: No evidence was found for cognitive decline following NAcc-DBS  comparing test results after 1 year of NAcc-DBS with baseline. However,  significantly improved cognitive performance on tests of attention, learning and  memory, executive functions and visual perception was found. In addition, there  was a general trend towards cognitive enhancement from below average to average performance. These procognitive effects were independent of the antidepressant  effects of NAcc-DBS or changes in NAcc-DBS parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results not only support cognitive safety of NAcc-DBS but also stress its beneficial role in augmenting cognitive performance in patients  with TRD, Context: the removal of brain Aβ via anti-Aβ antibodies. After an active vaccine (AN1792)  was discontinued in 2002 due to occurrence of meningoencephalitis in  approximately 6% of patients, several other second-generation active Aβ vaccines  and passive Aβ immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical  investigation with the aim of accelerating Aβ clearance from the brain of AD  patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab,  which is composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies that has been  tested in two Phase II trials. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden  in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its  clinical use.

INTERPRETATION: The safety profile is favourable for the ongoing development of  PBT2. The effect on putative biomarkers for AD in CSF but not in plasma is  suggestive of a central effect of the drug on Abeta metabolism. Cognitive  efficacy was restricted to two measures of executive function. Future trials  that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers  and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness, Context: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) appeared to be a promising target  for disease-modifying therapeutic strategies like passive immunotherapy with  anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Biochemical markers in cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) include alterations of Aβ that allow the diagnosis of AD. Biomarker  strategies, such as the levels of Aβ in CSF and plasma, currently play an  important role in early clinical trials for AD. Indeed, these strategies have a  relevant impact on the outcome of such studies, since the biomarkers are used to  monitor the bioactivity of anti-Aβ mAbs. The clinical trials of Solanezumab were  mainly based on the readout of Aβ levels in CSF and plasma, whereas those of Bapineuzumab were based on cognition; however, little is known about the  mechanisms altering these biomarker levels, and no biomarker has yet been proven  to be a successful predictor for AD therapy. In addition, the Aβ biomarkers allow for the determination of free and bound anti-Aβ mAb in order to monitor  the available amount of bioactive drug and could give hints to the mechanism of  action.
