What is ectopia lentis?,"Yes, ectopia lentis is a condition where the lens of the eye is not in its normal position. It can be associated with systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome or it can occur in isolation. Ectopia l","Context:  Ectopia lentis (EL) is a condition that can either herald underlying systemic  conditions, or be isolated. The recent expansion in the genetics of these  conditions has furthered the understanding of the underlying molecular aetiology. It is becoming apparent that novel genes, and in particular the  ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family,  are important in ocular development. The common link in these genes seems to be EL. The clinical management of EL is challenging. In particular, the options for  addressing surgically induced aphakia in the context of an ectopic capsule are  varied. Little evidence exists to direct management of these issues. This review, Context: of the family. CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an autosomal  dominant ectopia lentis family. This mutation has previously been reported in a  family with isolated ectopia lentis, in another family with ectopia lentis and  involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic  Marfan syndrome. This is the largest family with isolated ectopia lentis  reported to date. The results of the present study provide convincing evidence  for a correlation of R240C and isolated ectopia lentis.

It discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and extends them based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. According","Context: It is thought that during latent infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli  are retained within granulomas in a low-oxygen environment. The dormancy  survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be  essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the  regulon promotes survival. Here we report that mycobacteria, in contrast to  enteric bacteria, do not form higher-order structures (e.g. ribosomal dimers) upon entry into stasis. Instead, ribosomes are stabilized in the associated form  (70S). Using a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic, and ribosomal  profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during hypoxic stasis, we show that the dormancy regulator DosR is required for optimal  ribosome stabilization.

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"Yes, piRNAs are indeed involved in gene silencing. They protect genome integrity by silencing foreign genes like transposons. However, they can also target endogenous mRNAs for silencing, as observed in Ca","Context: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as  guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in  the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and  exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting  mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons  post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on  piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA  biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the  silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent  studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells.  Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is  to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world., Context: piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity,  but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon  mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the  dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA  silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the  absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and  conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind  the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of  RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the  absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA  silencing., Context: Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were reported in 2006 as a novel class of small  non-coding RNAs associated with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute/Piwi family.  Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles  in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in  epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In addition,  the function of this pathway in somatic cells has also been more systematically characterized. The new findings reveal the Piwi-piRNA pathway as a more general  mechanism of gene regulation., Context: Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage, Context: In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and  TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the  targets of piRNA-mediated silencing. We have demonstrated that expression of  reporter genes driven by the HeT-A promoter is under the control of the piRNA  silencing pathway independent of the transgene location. In order to test directly whether piRNAs affect the transcriptional state of retrotransposons we  performed a nuclear run-on (NRO) assay and revealed increased density of the  active RNA polymerase complexes at the sequences of endogenous HeT-A and TART telomeric retroelements as well as HeT-A-containing constructs in the ovaries of  spn-E mutants and in flies with piwi knockdown.

What is the minimal genome build?,"No, the context does not provide information on a minimal genome build. Instead, it discusses the concept of gene persistence as an alternative to defining a minimal genome.","Context: A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal  genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly  context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a  single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of  consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds  another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. Here, as an alternative to defining a minimal genome, we propose that the  concept of gene persistence can be used to classify genes needed for robust  long-term survival. Persistent genes, although not ubiquitous, are conserved in a majority of genomes, tend to be expressed at high levels, and are frequently  located on the leading DNA strand. These criteria impose constraints on genome  organization, and these are important considerations for engineering cells and, Context:  The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how  few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a  parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common  ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. However,  the study of minimal cellular systems is the study of biological outliers where, by practical necessity, coevolutionary interactions are minimized or ignored. In  this paper, we consider the biological context from which minimal genomes have  been removed. For instance, some of the most reduced genomes are from, Context:  Mitochondrial (mt) genomes from diverse phylogenetic groups vary considerably in  size, structure and organization.

Which histone marks are deposited by Set7?,"Yes, according to the context, Set7 deposits mono-methylated H3K4 (H3K4me1) mark. This is stated in the first paragraph of the context where it mentions that ""Among","Context: An organism's genome sequence serves as a blueprint for the proteins and  regulatory RNAs essential for cellular function. The genome also harbors  cis-acting non-coding sequences that control gene expression and are essential  to coordinate regulatory programs during embryonic development. However, the  genome sequence is largely identical between cell types within a multi-cellular  organism indicating that factors such as DNA accessibility and chromatin  structure play a crucial role in governing cell-specific gene expression. Recent  studies have identified particular chromatin modifications that define  functionally distinct cis regulatory elements. Among these are forms of histone 3 that are mono- or tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3,  respectively), which bind preferentially to promoter and enhancer elements in  the mammalian genome. In this work, we investigated whether these modified histones could similarly identify cis regulatory elements within the zebrafish  genome. By applying chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing,  we find that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are enriched at transcriptional start sites in, Context:  We describe distinct patterns of histone methylation during human cell cycle  progression. Histone H4 methyltransferase activity was found to be cell  cycle-regulated, consistent with increased H4 Lys 20 methylation at mitosis. This increase closely followed the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H4 Lys  20 methyltransferase, PR-Set7. Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes  and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase. These data suggest that H4 Lys  20 methylation by PR-Set7 during mitosis acts to antagonize H4 Lys 16  acetylation and to establish a mechanism by which this mark is epigenetically  transmitted., Context: H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes  interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are  direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1  subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their  recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions.  H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the  imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation  mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and  interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active  role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic  silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells., Context: these two enzyme classes has drawn significant attention from the pharmaceutical  industry. Herein, the authors describe the development and optimization of  homogeneous LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA antibody-based assays for measuring the  catalytic activity of two epigenetic enzymes acting on lysine 4 of histone H3:  SET7/9 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase. Both the SET7/9 and LSD1 assays  were designed as signal-increase assays using biotinylated peptides derived from  the N-terminus of histone H3. In addition, the SET7/9 assay was demonstrated  using full-length histone H3 protein as substrate in the AlphaLISA format.  Optimized assays in 384-well plates are robust (Z' factors ≥0.7) and sensitive, requiring only nanomolar concentrations of enzyme and substrate. All assays  allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate  that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule  inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies., Context: Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational  modifications of core histones.

RESULTS: ROC curves of ""death within 3 months"", ""death within 6 months"", and  ""death within 12 months"" showed no significant difference between Tomita score  and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38,  respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system  overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system  underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS: Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict  prognosis of spinal metastases after operation. Tokuhashi scoring system can predict early death more accurately, which can be used to avoid major operation  for these patients., Context: PURPOSE: The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate  indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal  disease. Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for  metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted  survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to  determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS: This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with  MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009  were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected prospectively to October 2011.

To better define the biological function of  these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and  assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of  all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous  analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We  find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1,  class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently  identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group ""class 4"" to distinguish  it from the unrelated ""class 3"" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms  contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of  HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC  proteins.

Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1,  p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell  cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have  therapeutic potential against tumors., Context: and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax  channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced  apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-α plus cycloheximide to determine the  effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization.  Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when  apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7  cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared  with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP  activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell., Context: three basic residues within the C-segment destabilized Bak. Replacing the Bak  C-segment with that from Bax rescued stability and function, but unexpectedly  resulted in a semi-cytosolic protein, termed Bak/BaxCS. When in the cytosol,  both Bax and Bak/BaxCS sequestered their hydrophobic transmembrane domains in  their hydrophobic surface groove. Upon apoptotic signalling, Bak/BaxCS  translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane, inserted its transmembrane  domain, oligomerized, and released cytochrome c. Despite this Bax-like  subcellular distribution, Bak/BaxCS retained Bak-like regulation following  targeting of Mcl-1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Residues in the C-segment of Bak and of Bax contribute to their distinct subcellular localizations. That a semi-cytosolic form of Bak,  Bak/BaxCS, could translocate to mitochondria and release cytochrome c indicates  that Bak and Bax share a conserved mode of activation.

Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer?,"Yes, malat-1 is upregulated in some cancers such as stage I NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) and bladder cancer.

Individual clones (n=225) were sequenced  and quantitative RT-PCR verified overexpression in metastasizing samples.  Several of the identified genes (eIF4A1, thymosin beta4 and a novel transcript  named MALAT-1) were demonstrated to be significantly associated with metastasis  in NSCLC patients (n=70). The genes' association with metastasis was stage- and  histology specific. The Kaplan-Meier analyses identified MALAT-1 and thymosin  beta4 as prognostic parameters for patient survival in stage I NSCLC. The novel  MALAT-1 transcript is a noncoding RNA of more than 8000 nt expressed from chromosome 11q13. It is highly expressed in lung, pancreas and other healthy  organs as well as in NSCLC. MALAT-1 expressed sequences are conserved across  several species indicating its potentially important function. Taken together, these data contribute to the identification of early-stage NSCLC patients that  are at high risk to develop metastasis. The identification of MALAT-1 emphasizes  the potential role of noncoding RNAs in human cancer., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated  MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its  biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1  expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently  metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize., Context:  Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to  have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression  is upregulated in some tumors.

Despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the 3' end of MALAT1 is produced not by canonical cleavage/polyadenylation but  instead by recognition and cleavage of a tRNA-like structure by RNase P. Mature  MALAT1 thus lacks a poly(A) tail yet is expressed at a level higher than many protein-coding genes in vivo. Here we show that the 3' ends of MALAT1 and the  MEN β long noncoding RNAs are protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by highly  conserved triple helical structures. Surprisingly, when these structures are, Context:  The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma  transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant  transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its  functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor  cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique  loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of  splicing or gene expression.

Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?,"No, the 3D structure of the genome is not stable during cell differentiation. According to the context, there is substantial remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC)","Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside, Context:  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order  chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an  important role in the control of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription  programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells  into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal  differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on  mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. During epidermal, Context: We argue that the content of the ICD compartment is highly enriched in DNA  depleted biochemical matrix preparations. The ICD compartment may be considered  as the structural and functional equivalent of the in vivo nuclear matrix. A  matrix in this functional sense is compatible with but does not necessitate the  concept of a 3D nuclear skeleton existing of long, extensively arborized  filaments. In the absence of unequivocal evidence for such a structural matrix  in the nucleus of living cells we keep an agnostic attitude about its existence  and possible properties in maintaining the higher-order nuclear architecture.  Quantitative modeling of the 3D and 4D human genome architecture in situ shows that such an assumption is not necessary to explain presently known aspects of  the higher-order nuclear architecture. We expect that the interplay of  quantitative modeling and experimental tests will result in a better understanding of the compartmentalized nuclear architecture and its functional  consequences., Context: organization of the eukaryotic genomes.

There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib.

These include the IL-17 antagonists, secukinumab,  brodalumab and ixekizumab; the IL-23 antagonists, guselkumab and tildrakizumab;  and the oral small molecule therapies, tofacitinib and apremilast. Here, we  review evidence for the efficacy and safety of these novel psoriasis therapies,  providing clinicians with an overview of the next era in immunotherapy for  psoriasis., Context: ""Psoriasis"" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal  hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often  known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the  pathogenesis of psoriasis. ""IL-17"" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly  important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The  three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and  ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab  neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical  trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The  biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials  was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible  differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A  ligand., Context: lesional skin, IL17A, IL17C, and IL17F, were all downregulated in a  dose-dependent manner following brodalumab treatment. Cellular measures also  showed a similar pattern with dramatic decreases in keratinocyte hyperplasia  within one week, and decreases in infiltrating leukocytes occurred over a longer  timescale. Individuals with the highest brodalumab exposure showed normalization  of both IL-17-responsive genes and the psoriasis transcriptome, whereas subjects  with lower exposures showed transient or incomplete molecular responses.  Clinical and molecular response appeared dependent on the extent of brodalumab  exposure relative to the expression of IL-17 ligand genes, and reduction of IL-17 signaling into the nonlesional range was strongly correlated with  normalization of the psoriasis transcriptome. These data indicate that blockade  of IL-17 signaling in psoriatic skin leads to rapid transcriptomal changes initially in keratinocyte-expressed genes, followed by normalization in the  leukocyte abnormalities, and demonstrates the essential role of the IL-17R on  keratinocytes in driving disease pathogenesis., Context: ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway.

It binds  with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of human  telomerase (hTERC) and is a competitive inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic  activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase II  dose of imetelstat in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imetelstat was administered intravenously more than two  hours on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. Dose levels of 225, 285, and 360 mg/m(2)  were evaluated, using the rolling-six design. Imetelstat pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies were also performed during the first cycle. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled (median age, 14 years; range, 3-21).  Seventeen were evaluable for toxicity. The most common toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia, with dose-limiting  myelosuppression in 2 of 6 patients at 360 mg/m(2).

The effects of imetelstat on telomere length, DNA damage response, and cell proliferation were assessed. The efficacy of imetelstat in vivo was  evaluated in subcutaneous xenografts derived from each of the cell lines.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as  measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and  phosphorylation of TP53.

This is explicitly stated in the context where it mentions that ranasmurfin crystals are an intense blue color.,"Context: neighbors within a few hours. The post-caspase activation events that determine  whether a cell will undergo apoptosis remain elusive. Here we report that  apoptosis-specific nuclear events that occur before DNA fragmentation can be  distinguished by monitoring the histone H1 status. In both mammals and  Drosophila, dying cells failed to be immunolabeled with an anti-H1 monoclonal  antibody, AE-4. Real-time imaging of caspase activation and H1 dynamics in  mammalian neural cells revealed that H1 changed its location in the nucleus  after caspase activation. In addition, the timing of this re-localization was  largely dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. From the staining patterns of AE-4 and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies, cells undergoing the transition from  caspase activation to the apoptotic H1 change could be identified as H1-positive  caspase-activated cells, providing a novel criterion for early apoptosis and making it possible to characterize caspase-activated cells in tissues.

What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?,"Yes, EZH2 has an effect on chromatin. In the provided context, it is mentioned that EZH2 plays a role in epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into hypoacetylated domains covered with hist","Context: of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we  show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into  hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled  by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ  hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to  the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is  tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of  H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant  gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3  levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer  cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer,  these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of, Context: peripheral nervous system maturation are just emerging. Here, we demonstrate for  the first time the impact of a histone methyltransferase, encoded by the  enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) gene, on Schwann cell differentiation. In  sciatic nerves, EZH2 expression was found in Schwann cells and to peak  perinatally. Suppression of EZH2 expression in cultured primary rat Schwann  cells reduced the length of cell processes. These morphological changes were  accompanied by widespread alterations in the gene expression pattern, including  downregulation of myelin genes and induction of p57kip2, which we have recently  identified as an intrinsic inhibitory regulator of Schwann cell maturation. In addition, we show that EZH2 suppression in dorsal root ganglion cocultures  interferes with in vitro myelination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis  revealed binding of EZH2 at the p57kip2 promoter and reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation upon gene suppression. EZH2 suppression-dependent effects on  morphology and myelin genes could be reversed by concomitant suppression of  p57kip2, indicating that p57kip2 is a downstream effector of EZH2. Furthermore,, Context: PURPOSE: Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase,  plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our  objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the  anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry and cytosolic/nuclear fractionation  were done to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 in normal pancreas and  human pancreatic tumors. We used RNA interference, Western blotting, reverse  transcription-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the effect of EZH2  depletion on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival.

The present study  was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte  autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to  reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal  cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed  that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin  immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition,  overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR  phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3  expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR  signaling.

Reduced proliferation was less  pronounced in the normal ductal epithelial cell line human pancreatic, Context: for JNK1 revealed that JNK silencing reduced serine727 phosphorylation of STAT3,  Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation, suggesting that JNK is the upstream  kinase involved in As ( 3+) -induced EZH2 phosphorylation. Because As ( 3+) is  capable of inducing miRNA-21 (miR-21), a STAT3-regulated miRNA that represses  protein translation of PTEN or Spry2, we also tested the role of STAT3 and  miR-21 in As ( 3+) -induced EZH2 phosphorylation. Ectopic overexpression of  miR-21 promoted Akt activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting  miR-21 by transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and  EZH2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a contribution of the JNK, STAT3 and Akt signaling axis to As ( 3+) -induced EZH2  phosphorylation. Importantly, these findings may reveal new molecular mechanisms  underlying As ( 3+) -induced carcinogenesis., Context:  MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular  system.

Patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC are initially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib but  eventually become resistant, limiting its therapeutic potential. Ceritinib is an  oral second-generation ALK inhibitor with greater preclinical antitumor potency  than crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. A Phase I trial of ceritinib in ALK-positive tumors demonstrated good activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,  including those who had progressed on crizotinib. Adverse events are similar to  those seen with other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are generally manageable. Ongoing trials are evaluating ceritinib in patients with  ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with prior chemotherapy and/or crizotinib., Context: Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired  resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor  and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring  the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired  resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the  mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale  overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end,  ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib.  H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway  activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other  ALK-TKIs.

Briefly describe a deep learning system that is more accurate than human experts at detecting melanoma.,"Yes, there is a deep learning system described in the context that outperforms dermatologists at detecting melanoma using dermoscopic images. This system employs very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs","Context:  Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided  diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve  diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear,  previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both  detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the  target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove  inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in, Context: Automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images is a very challenging task  due to the low contrast of skin lesions, the huge intraclass variation of  melanomas, the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and  non-melanoma lesions, and the existence of many artifacts in the image. In order  to meet these challenges, we propose a novel method for melanoma recognition by  leveraging very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with  existing methods employing either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with  shallower architectures, our substantially deeper networks (more than 50 layers)  can acquire richer and more discriminative features for more accurate recognition. To take full advantage of very deep networks, we propose a set of  schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data.  First, we apply the residual learning to cope with the degradation and overfitting problems when a network goes deeper. This technique can ensure that  our networks benefit from the performance gains achieved by increasing network  depth. Then, we construct a fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) for, Context:  BACKGROUND: Computer vision may aid in melanoma detection.

It utilizes a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel","Context: lacking, in this study, four computational approaches were utilized to test the  hypothesis that microRNAs and their posttranscriptionally regulated mRNA  targets, i.e., both total mRNAs and actively translated mRNA transcripts, are  differentially modulated by carcinogen and diet treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats  were fed diets containing corn oil ± fish oil with pectin ± cellulose and  injected with azoxymethane or saline (control). Colonic mucosa was assayed at an  early time of cancer progression, and global gene set enrichment analysis was  used to obtain those microRNAs significantly enriched by the change in  expression of their putative target genes. In addition, cumulative distribution function plots and functional network analyses were used to evaluate the impact  of diet and carcinogen combination on mRNA levels induced via microRNA  alterations. Finally, linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the best single-, two-, and three-microRNA combinations for classifying dietary effects  and colon tumor development. We demonstrate that polysomal profiling is tightly  related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In, Context: The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or  structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently  supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account  sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these  studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and  prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new  computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on  Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the  simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity  and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained  classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using  expression information from a full genome tiling array.

What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?,"Yes, TRH does have an effect on myocardial contractility. In isolated guinea pig cardiac muscle, TRH increased the contractile force dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction in normal Tyrode and","Context: cardiac contractility, which however qualitatively differed at lower vs. higher  concentrations of the hormone: at 1 mumol/l, TRH was found to significantly  enhance the rate of contraction as well as that of relaxation (by 23.2 +/- 3.7  and 27.8 +/- 7.7%, respectively), which culminated in an increased peak  contractile force. However, at 10 mumol/l, the positive inotropic effect of TRH  (i.e. the increase in peak contractile force) was smaller than at 1 mumol/l,  which apparently was due to both a reduced TRH-induced elevation in the rate of  contraction (12.4 +/- 3.2%) and a TRH-induced decrease in relaxation rate (11.1  +/- 8.1%). Since TRH is expressed in the heart, the above findings suggest that, in addition to its CNS-mediated cardiovascular effects, TRH modulates cardiac  contractility as an autocrine regulator in a concentration-dependent manner,  which likely involves more than one TRH receptor and associated signaling  pathway., Context:  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and  myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) and increased  plasma epinephrine levels significantly at 10 min after TRH treatment in rabbits following shock, but the effects of TRH on MAP and myocardial contractility  disappeared in reserpinized rabbits (4 mg/kg, 24 hr pre-treatment, iv).

RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic  changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24  hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell  proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects  than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences  between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with  post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI  was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus  netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal  keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly  less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the, Context:  The Ca(2+)-dependent binding of Annexin V to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces  is a reliable marker for apoptosis that is widely used in flow cytometry based  apoptosis assays. In this paper, we report a new class of Annexin V-based probes for apoptosis. Luciferase from Renilla reniformis (RLuc) was linked to Annexin V  and expressed successfully in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The  new probe, Rluc/Annexin V, was purified and functionally assayed for detection of apoptosis in actinomycin D-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, the  spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils was shown using the new probe. The results  indicate that Rluc/Annexin V can bind to the apoptotic cells, and the signal of, Context: morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation.  Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of  binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high  affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by  cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V  binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive  subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an  convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc  gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues., Context:  Annexin V can be used to detect apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo, based on  its ability to identify extracellular phosphatidylserine, which arises during  apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the synthesis of fluorine-18 labelled annexin V as a positron emission tomography tracer for apoptosis  imaging. The distribution of [18F]annexin V and technetium-99m labelled annexin  V, a well-characterised SPET tracer for apoptosis imaging, was compared. [18F]annexin V was synthesised using N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate as an  18F labelling reagent. Synthesised and purified [18F]annexin V was confirmed by  SDS-PAGE.

METHODS: The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis  rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with  quercetin. Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of  NB4 cells was significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4  leukemia cells.","16331047, 23000925, 7812008, 14666384, 16737615","Yes, annexin V is an early apoptotic marker.","20520578, 16813956, 12573319, 16253964, 20430734, 14666384, 11585299, 21203987, 12552341, 24021657, 21340828, 25116573, 18441250, 16331047, 7812008, 27619241, 20122665, 26734508, 14676140, 11708469, 9359032, 16046522, 9462458, 26935620, 9776585, 26582221, 16737615, 9461328, 25591763, 7622868, 24412631, 22960471, 14734682, 23000925, 26112094, 16740972, 16239600, 16306419, 18554742, 20444920, 22913657, 25339644, 10541822"
Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?,"No, the context does not provide information about any specific ultraconserved element being associated with ESC self-renewal.","Context: distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with  complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly  and human. In addition to a well-known association with developmental genes,  these DNA elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential  cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate  immunity, and sensory reception. Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved  elements clustered by sequence similarity. Furthermore, species composition and  flanking genes of clusters showed lineage-specific patterns. Ultraconserved  elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster. CONCLUSION: We identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across  distant species. Specific classes of these conserved elements seem to have been generated before the divergence of taxa and fixed during the process of  evolution. Our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the  exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from, Context: invertebrates. However, their roles in mammalian embryonic development and stem  cell maintenance remained largely uncharacterized. Here we report an essential  requirement of the Pum gene family in early embryonic development. A loss of  both Pum1 and Pum2 genes led to gastrulation failure, resulting in embryo  lethality at E8.5. Pum-deficient blastocysts, however, appeared morphologically  normal, from which embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could be established. Both mutant  ESCs and embryos exhibited reduced growth and increased expression of endoderm  markers Gata6 and Lama1, making defects in growth and differentiation the likely  causes of gastrulation failure. Furthermore, ESC Gata6 transcripts could be pulled down via PUM1 immunoprecipitation and mutation of conserved PUM-binding  element on 3'UTR (untranslated region) of Gata6 enhanced the expression of  luciferase reporter, implicating PUM-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of Gata6 expression in stem cell development and cell lineage determination. Hence,  like its invertebrate homologues, mouse PUM proteins are conserved  posttranscriptional regulators essential for embryonic and stem cell  development., Context:  For self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require the expression of specific  transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to  maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome  organization in ESCs is not well understood. Here we show that the cohesin  component RAD21 exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of  RAD21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by  CTCF independent co-localization of cohesin with pluripotency related, Context:  Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent the naïve ground state of the  preimplantation epiblast and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) represent the primed  state of the postimplantation epiblast. Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous  and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to  differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite  considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and  pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here, Context: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been  implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe  a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its  function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function  approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem  Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced  self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant  characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its  pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator  that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5  promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains  the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of  Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways.

As a result, The LACE index achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions.  The optimal cut-off for the LACE index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity  of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the PARR algorithm achieved an AUC score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions.

Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?,"Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. This is evident as genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability are often due to defects in genes critical for homologous recom","Context:  We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational  repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic  disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia  telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like  disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These  genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation  (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs)., Context: proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases, which have diverse roles in  multiple DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination and DNA  repair. In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified and three of them  namely, WRN, BLM and RecQL4 have been linked to genetic diseases characterized  by genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. This helicase  family plays important roles in various DNA repair pathways including protecting  the genome from illegitimate recombination during chromosome segregation in  mitosis and assuring genome stability. This review mainly focuses on various  roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in  the development of cancer and premature aging., Context: Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of a wide range of  cancers. Besides innovations in the physical application of radiation dose,  radiation therapy is likely to benefit from novel approaches exploiting  differences in radiation response between normal and tumor cells. While ionizing  radiation induces a variety of DNA lesions, including base damages and  single-strand breaks, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is widely considered as  the lesion responsible not only for the aimed cell killing of tumor cells, but  also for the general genomic instability that leads to the development of  secondary cancers among normal cells. Homologous recombination repair (HRR), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternative NHEJ, operating as a backup,  are the major pathways utilized by cells for the processing of DSBs. Therefore,  their function represents a major mechanism of radiation resistance in tumor cells. HRR is also required to overcome replication stress - a potent  contributor to genomic instability that fuels cancer development. HRR and  alternative NHEJ show strong cell-cycle dependency and are likely to benefit, Context:  Although homologous recombination (HR) is an important pathway for DNA repair,  it can also be a cause for deleterious genomic rearrangements leading to  carcinogenesis. Therefore, cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate HR, positively as well as negatively. Among many molecular components that  regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer  early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key  recombinase in HR. Here, for the first time we studied HR regulation by the  combined action of p53 and BRCA2, in vitro. While BRC4 peptide inhibits ATP, Context: to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of  dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have  tumourigenic potential. In other instances, DSBs can be sufficient to induce  apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved  complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these  lesions, signal their presence and bring about their repair. Here, I provide an  overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of  DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited  or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, and may affect the sensitivity of patients or tumour cells to  radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies. An increased knowledge of DSB repair  and of other DNA DSB responses may therefore provide opportunities for developing more effective treatments for cancer.","12427531, 19083132, 23675572, 23678008, 12016139",Yes.

The distribution pattern of here and  previously reported HLXB9 mutations indicates mutational predilection sites  within exon 1 and the homeobox. Furthermore, sequence homology to Drosophila homeobox genes suggest that some of these mutations located within the homeobox  may alter the DNA-binding specificity of HB9 while those in sequences homologous  to a recently identified NLS motif of the human homeobox gene PDX-1 may impair nuclear translocation of the mutated protein., Context: apicobasal polarity, adhesion and tissue architecture. As vertebrate homologs of  some Drosophila nTSGs are linked to tumor formation, identifying molecular  changes in signaling associated with nTSG loss could inform understanding of  neoplastic transformation in vertebrates. Here we show that mutations in genes  that act at multiple steps of the endolysosomal pathway lead to autonomous  activation of the Sav/Wts/Hpo (SWH) transcriptional effector Yki (YAP/TAZ in  vertebrates) and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is known to promote Yki  activity in cells with disrupted polarity. Yki and JNK activity are elevated by  mutations at multiple steps in the endolysosomal pathway including mutations in the AP-2σ gene, which encodes a component of the AP-2 adaptor complex that  recruits cargoes into clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization.  Moreover, reduction of JNK activity can decrease elevated Yki-signaling caused by altered endocytosis. These studies reveal a broad requirement for components  of the endocytic pathway in regulating SWH and JNK outputs, and place Drosophila  endocytic nTSGs into a network that involving two major signaling pathways, Context: The mechanisms that regulate mammalian organ size are poorly understood. It is  unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on  stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the  ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway.  Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in  the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size  and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly  increases liver size more than 4-fold.

Phylogenetic and genomic analyses show that they form four distinct families,  one of which contains the yCCR4 orthologs. The orthologs in animals possess a  leucine-rich repeat domain. We show, using two-hybrid and far-Western assays,  that the human member binds to the human yPOP2 homologs, i.e. hCAF1 and hPOP2,  in a LRR-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the mammalian orthologs of yCCR4 and have shown  that the human member binds to the human yPOP2 homologs, thus strongly suggesting conservation of the CCR4-NOT complex from yeast to human. All members  of the four identified yCCR4-related protein families show stricking  conservation of the endonuclease-like catalytic motifs of the yCCR4 C-terminal domain and therefore constitute a new family of potential deadenylases in  mammals.","11528505, 22101275, 17980593, 17980593, 11747467",There are two mammalian orthologs of Yki: YAP and TAZ,"22898666, 17980593, 18413746, 23484853, 23985272, 19878874, 22101275"

DTO has been implemented in  the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target  disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for  druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene,  protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism  of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging  integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,  drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug discovery.

Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging  anti-Aβ drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs  in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the  β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor  for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of  cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1).

RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, the treatment targets are classified according  to the cells which are involved in the pathogenesis of CSU. Those are mast  cells/basophils, B cells, T cells and eosinophils. The treatments that are under  clinical trials for CSU are anti-IgE treatments such as ligelizumab, molecules  targeting intracellular signaling pathways such as spleen tyrosine kinase  inhibitors, surface inhibitory molecules such as siglec-8, anti-IL-1s such as  canakinumab, Bruton kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as GDC-0853 and anti-IL-5s such as benralizumab and mepolizumab. SUMMARY: The ongoing clinical trials on new targets of treatment hold new hopes  not only for a better care of the disease but also a better understanding of the  pathomechanisms lying underneath., Context: Since the innovation of epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analog, providing treatment  for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the 1990s, two types of oral drugs,  endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, have  further improved therapy for PAH. In contrast, it has become clear that the  efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs is limited, and the establishment of  combination therapies should be considered for PAH. Given that the newest PAH  drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble  guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin  (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently  required. In the next decade, it can be expected that the discovery of  efficacious combination therapies, involving old and new drugs, will lead to significant advances in the treatment of PAH., Context: Introduction Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive  cancer with poor survival that is difficult to treat due to a lack of targeted  options.

Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of  breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC  applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein  groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. Moreover, we have  characterized some signaling pathways that could be related to TNBC genesis and  development.

In clinical trials, ibalizumab has  demonstrated anti-HIV-1 activity in patients without causing immunosuppression.  Thus, a characterization of the ibalizumab epitope was conducted in an attempt  to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of its antiviral activity as well  as its safety profile. By studying mouse/human chimeric CD4 molecules and  site-directed point mutants of CD4, amino acids L96, P121, P122, and Q163 in  domain 2 were found to be important for ibalizumab binding, with E77 and S79 in domain 1 also contributing.

It potently blocks  HIV-1 infection and targets an epitope in the second domain of CD4 without  interfering with immune functions mediated by interaction of CD4 with major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. We report here the crystal  structure of ibalizumab Fab fragment in complex with the first two domains  (D1-D2) of CD4 at 2.2 Å resolution. Ibalizumab grips CD4 primarily by the  BC-loop (residues 121-125) of D2, sitting on the opposite side of gp120 and  MHC-II binding sites. No major conformational change in CD4 accompanies binding  to ibalizumab. Both monovalent and bivalent forms of ibalizumab effectively block viral infection, suggesting that it does not need to crosslink CD4 to  exert antiviral activity.

List 3 indications for Bupropion,"Yes, the context provides information about the indications for bupropion. Three indications for bupropion are as an antidepressant, as a tobacco use cessation agent, and as a treatment for psychostimul","Context: once-daily extended-release formulation was introduced. On the 15th anniversary  of its introduction, we undertook a review of the background/history, mechanism  of action, formulations, and clinical profile of bupropion.  DATA SOURCES: Major efficacy trials and other reports were obtained and reviewed  from MEDLINE searches, review of abstracts from professional meetings, and the  bupropion SR manufacturer's databases. Searches of English-language articles  were conducted from June 2003 through August 2004. No time limit was specified  in the searches, which were conducted using the search terms bupropion,  bupropion SR, and bupropion XL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine  neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin  neurotransmission. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants.  It is well tolerated in short-and longer-term treatment. Headache, dry mouth,  nausea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness are the most common adverse, Context: bupropion in a year fell from 11% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2005. The annual number of  bupropion prescriptions on the RPBS fell from 3786 in 2001 to 1173 in 2005,  while there was no change in the number of NRT prescriptions (3793 in 2001 and  3886 in 2005). Sales data from the leading market supplier of NRT also indicated  that NRT use continued to grow in Australia while bupropion use declined.  Conclusions. Bupropion usage has fallen by 72% since a peak in the year of first  listing on the PBS, while the utilisation of NRTs appears to have increased,  despite the price differential in favour of bupropion. IMPLICATIONS: Given the greater interest among smokers in NRT than bupropion (and evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NRT), the  Australian government should reconsider its decision not to list NRT on the PBS., Context: self-administration.

This information","Context: Methamphetamine continues to be the most widely abused drug in Japan. Chronic  methamphetamine users show psychiatric signs, including methamphetamine  psychosis. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible  for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Abnormalities in MAO levels have been  related to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. We examined whether or not the  MAOA-u variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) has a functional polymorphism in methamphetamine psychosis and whether or not such a polymorphism is related to  the prolongation of psychosis. As expected, there was a significant difference  in the MAOA-u VNTR between males with persistent versus transient methamphetamine psychosis (p=0.018, odds ratio (OR)=2.76, 95% CI: 1.18-6.46).  Our results suggest that the high-activity allele class of MAOA-u VNTR in males  may be involved in susceptibility to a persistent course of methamphetamine, Context:  OBJECTIVE: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that  metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  Individuals with atypical depression (AD) are particularly responsive to treatment with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Biomarker tests are essential for prompt  diagnosis of AD, and to identify those with an altered brain neurotransmitter  metabolism who may selectively respond to MAOI therapy.

MAOA also  plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also  analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations,  affective disturbances, and poor concentration.

Recently, we and others identified high expression of MAOA in normal basal prostatic epithelium  and high-grade primary prostate cancer (PCa). In contrast, MAOA is low in normal  secretory prostatic epithelium and low-grade PCa.

Despite the association between MAOA and aggressive PCa, it is unclear how MAOA promotes PCa  progression. Here, we found that MAOA functions to induce  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stabilize the transcription factor HIF1α, which mediates hypoxia through an elevation of ROS, thus enhancing  growth, invasiveness, and metastasis of PCa cells.

Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?,"Yes, according to the context, many tumour-specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein-coding genes.

So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the  existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  indirect evidence is still missing. It is thus unknown how many tumours express  tumour specific antigen at all and whether these putative antigens are of unique  specificity or are shared by certain groups of (histologically related) neoplasias. Most reports agree that malignant cells in general have a more or  less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules abnormally and often in  the sense of hypoexpression or (sublocus selective) loss.

RESULTS: We enrolled 2056 patients (mean age 68.0 yr, 1046 (50.9%) women) who  had a rate of stroke of 1.8% at 7 days and 3.2% at 90 days. An ABCD2 score of more than 5 had a sensitivity of 31.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-47.5)  for stroke at 7 days and 29.2% (95% CI 19.6-41.2) for stroke at 90 days.

In silico tools  to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have  evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its  classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA  mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from  InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do  predict pathogenicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.595, P < 0.001). However, we discovered  31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population  allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a  second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm  their putative pathogenicity.

List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.,"Yes, the interaction partners for the protein GATA1 are LMO2-C and FOG-1. This is based on the MBP pull down analysis and point mutants of GATA-1 studies mentioned in the context.","Context: errors mainly in terms of false positive data sets and reducing therefore the  quality of any derived information. Typically these datasets can be modeled as  graphs, where vertices represent proteins and edges the pairwise PPIs, making it  easy to apply automated clustering methods to detect protein complexes or other  biological significant functional groupings. METHODS: In this paper, a clustering tool, called GIBA (named by the first  characters of its developers' nicknames), is presented. GIBA implements a two  step procedure to a given dataset of protein-protein interaction data. First, a  clustering algorithm is applied to the interaction data, which is then followed by a filtering step to generate the final candidate list of predicted complexes. RESULTS: The efficiency of GIBA is demonstrated through the analysis of 6  different yeast protein interaction datasets in comparison to four other available algorithms. We compared the results of the different methods by  applying five different performance measurement metrices. Moreover, the  parameters of the methods that constitute the filter have been checked on how, Context:  OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells.  Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had, Context: Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific  transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in  erythropoiesis. Our laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B promoter  region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription.  By further investigating the regulation of the Gfi-1B promoter, here we report  that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negatively regulated by its own gene product,  (ii) GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites in the  Gfi-1B promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses GATA-1-mediated stimulation of  Gfi-1B promoter through their protein interaction. These results not only demonstrate that interaction of GATA-1 and Gfi-1B participates in a feedback  regulatory pathway in controlling the expression of the Gfi-1B gene, but also  provide the first evidence that Gfi-1B can exert its repression function by acting on GATA-1-mediated transcription without direct binding to the Gfi-1 site  of the target genes. Based on these data, we propose that this negative  auto-regulatory feedback loop is important in restricting the expression level, Context: OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of  LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic  specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells.  RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form  successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to  LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had comparable binding affinities to LDB1 with LMO2-L, and over expression of LMO2-C  prevented LMO2-L from binding to LDB1, the inhibition rate being (81.13 +/-  0.68)%. RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of GPA was reduced [(51.00 +/- 1.58)%] in K562 cells while LMO2-C overexpressed. CONCLUSION: LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and  down regulates the expression of GPA., Context: Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play  essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown  that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in  addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central  mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins  including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these  interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships  between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood.  However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of  GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is  essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the  myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine  erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

We aim to establish liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry analysis of FFPE pancreatic tissue as a suitable  strategy for the study of the pancreas proteome.  METHODS: We investigated the proteomic profile of FFPE pancreatic tissue  specimens, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,  from 9 archived specimens that were histologically classified as normal (n = 3),  chronic pancreatitis (n = 3), and pancreatic cancer (n = 3). RESULTS: We identified 525 nonredundant proteins from 9 specimens. Implementing  our filtering criteria, 78, 15, and 21 proteins were identified exclusively in normal, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer specimens, respectively.  Several proteins were identified exclusively in specimens with no pancreatic  disease: spink 1, retinol dehydrogenase, and common pancreatic enzymes. Similarly, proteins were identified exclusively in chronic pancreatitis  specimens: collagen α1 (XIV), filamin A, collagen α3 (VI), and SNC73. Proteins  identified exclusively in pancreatic cancer included annexin 4A and fibronectin., Context:  Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we  unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo  splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in  intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless  mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export.  Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing  intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear, Context: recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in  the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

What animal is thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS?,"Yes, bats are thought to be the host for the Coronavirus causing MERS.

While  bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that  resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going  public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive  to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only  semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is, Context: novel human coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  MERS-CoV), associated with severe pneumonia, arose in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia. Until December 2016, MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35%  fatality rate. Finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or  antivirals against such emerging pathogens and to understand its pathogenesis.  Knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species  in the transmission of pathogens is of importance to understand the epidemiology  of the disease. Little is known about MERS-CoV animal host range. In this paper,  experimental data on potential hosts for MERS-CoV is reviewed. Advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral  pathogenesis and transmission studies. Finally, the relevance of potential new  target species is discussed., Context: in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three  nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes  and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other  available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological  data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged  independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory  samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same  geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from  corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these  clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions., Context: A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the  causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012.

The context discusses various resources and methods used to study binary fate decisions in hematop","Context: directly by GATA3. A genome-wide unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation assay  coupled with massive parallel sequencing analysis revealed that GATA3 bound to  1279 genes selectively in Th2 cells, and 101 genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells.  Simultaneously, we identified 26 highly Th2-specific STAT6-dependent inducible  genes by DNA microarray analysis-based three-step selection processes, and among  them 17 genes showed GATA3 binding. We assessed dependency on GATA3 for the  transcription of these 26 Th2-specific genes, and 10 genes showed increased  transcription in a GATA3-dependent manner, whereas 16 genes showed no  significant responses. The transcription of the 16 GATA3-nonresponding genes was clearly increased by the introduction of an active form of STAT6, STAT6VT.  Therefore, although GATA3 has been recognized as a master regulator of Th2 cell  differentiation, many Th2-specific genes are not regulated by GATA3 itself, but in collaboration with STAT6., Context: abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The  CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an  excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types  are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their  TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their  fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two  coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been  made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of  genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks. In  this chapter, I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the binary  cell fate decision processes of T cells., Context: During blood cell development, hematopoietic stem cells generate diverse mature  populations via several rounds of binary fate decisions. At each bifurcation,  precursors adopt one fate and inactivate the alternative fate either  stochastically or in response to extrinsic stimuli and stably maintain the  selected fates. Studying of these processes would contribute to better  understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by  abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells.

In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?,"Yes, according to the context, stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that form in cells under stress conditions. They can be found in cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 or enterovirus","Context: in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32  amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence  (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion  of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of  FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress  granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive  cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS  inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies,  which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS  mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic  inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism., Context: granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they  are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking  FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells  expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of  mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the  nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG  domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response., Context:  Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that are formed in cells when  stress occurs. In this study, we found that SGs formed in cells infected with  coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), evidenced with the co-localization of some accepted SG markers in the viral infection-induced granules. We further discovered that  adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1), which can bind  to mRNAs and regulate their translation, was recruited to the SGs in response to high dose of CVB3 by detecting the co-localization of AUF1 with SG markers.  Similar results were also observed in the enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells.  Finally, we demonstrated that AUF1 was also recruited to arsenite-induced SGs,, Context: following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the  Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required  for its localization to stress granules.

Various drugs  currently are available to control the complex and different symptoms reported  by patients. Only three drugs (duloxetine, milnacipram, pregabalin) are approved  by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and none by the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), consequently, off-label use is habitual in Europe. Most  of the drugs improve only one or two symptoms; no drug capable of overall  symptom control is yet available. Furthermore, different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic  antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), growth hormone, corticosteroids and sedative  hypnotics. As no single drug fully manages FM symptoms, multicomponent therapy  should be used from the beginning. Various pharmacological treatments have been, Context: stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARB) (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics  (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)  (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear  benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an  angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696  (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF. CONCLUSION: In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment  modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients  with HFpEF., Context: Heart failure affects ≈5.7 million people in the United States alone.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,  β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with  heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July  2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of  drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known  as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the  angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug  sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme  responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other  vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart  failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased  sensitivity to natriuretic peptides.

What is the relationship between thyroid hormone and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients?,"Yes, there is a relationship between thyroid hormones and inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. The context mentions that one study investigated plasma circulating levels of cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6","Context:  Cytokines and thyroid hormones are involved in the biochemical changes  associated to heart failure (HF). AIM: Aims of the study were to investigate: plasma circulating levels of the cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) TNF alpha and C reactive protein (CRP) in  patients with stable HF in relation to the severity of left ventricular  dysfunction; the relationship between these inflammatory markers and thyroid  hormones. METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six patients (121 males, age 64+/-12), with  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, were admitted to the Institute of Clinical  Physiology for progressive deterioration of symptoms. Forty-eight healthy, Context: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure are often severely ill and may  experience substantial abnormalities in thyroid hormone metabolism. Thus, we  examined this patient population to determine the prevalence and prognostic  significance of altered thyroid hormone concentrations, the course of thyroid  abnormalities in congestive heart failure survivors, and the potential  relationship of thyroid abnormalities to overall metabolic rate. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone metabolism (ie, the triiodothyronine to reverse  triiodothyronine ratio) is altered in a majority of patients with advanced  congestive heart failure and is an independent predictor of mortality. Currently a study is underway that will provide further evidence for the mechanisms  involved in congestive heart failure and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism., Context:  Interest in the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in heart failure is steadily  increasing due to evidence for a physiological, homeostatic role of TH and the  effects of altered TH metabolism on the cardiovascular system, particularly in presence of heart failure. Experimental studies have shown that altered TH  metabolism modifies cardiovascular homeostasis by inducing alterations of  cardiac histology, cardiomyocyte morphology and gene expression and consequently, of diastolic and systolic myocardial function. Clinical studies  have shown that mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, both primary (subclinical  hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism) and secondary (low T(3), Context:  Though thyroid hormone abnormalities have been identified in many cardiac  conditions, the role of thyroid hormones in congestive heart failure has not  been well defined. In a population of patients with advanced heart failure, a reduction in triiodothyronine (T3) with an increase in reverse T3 was identified  in many patients, with an abnormally low ratio of T3/reverse T3 being the  strongest predictor of mortality. Normalization of thyroid indices appeared to be necessary for prolonged survival to occur. To address the concern of T3  administration possibility exacerbating a hypermetabolic state, basal metabolic  rate was measured in a group of advanced heart failure patients and was found to, Context: in its initial phases presents a physiological hypertrophy with increases in  SERCa2 levels and decreased expression of MHC beta. In contrast, pressure  overload induced heart failure leads to a ""pathological"" cardiac hypertrophy  which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the  MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can  lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart.  In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In  addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the  frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The decrease in T3 serves as an indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to  increased mortality. In animal models, it can be shown that in pressure  overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy a decrease of thyroid hormone receptor levels occurs. Cardiac function can be improved by increasing expression of  thyroid hormone receptors mediated by adeno-associated virus based gene  transfer. The failing heart may develop a ""hypothyroid"" status contributing to","19926244, 8333797, 18221125, 8936683, 19125327",There is an inverse correlation between inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF alfa and PCR) and FT3 levels in patients with heart failure,"16524802, 19926244, 11021766, 15259379, 15521205, 12165115"
Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?,"Yes, thrombophilia is related to an increased risk of miscarriage. In the given context, it was stated that 53 (13%) women had antiphospholipid antibodies, which were mainly associated","Context: placental abruption. We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one  thrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common  thrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous  thromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the  second or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies)  mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first  trimester. In conclusion, thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common  in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism  during pregnancy and the postpartum period., Context: OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular  disease. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether the presence of  thrombophilia results in a greater tendency to develop endothelial dysfunction  and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Ten women with thrombophilia were matched with 10 women without  thrombophilia for a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.  Laboratory measurements: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and micro- and  macrovascular function were determined. RESULTS: Women with thrombophilia had significant lower total- and low-density  cholesterol, were more insulin sensitive, and had better microvascular function.

Maternal screening and treatment may lower the recurrence of these  outcomes. Our objective was to estimate if antenatal screening for  thrombophilias with the intention to offer treatment among women with a prior adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) is preferable to no screening. A  decision-analytical model was constructed for pregnant women with prior APO,  comparing screening for thrombophilia with intention to treat with no screening., Context:  PURPOSE: To determine if thrombophilia is a risk factor for placenta-mediated  pregnancy complications (PMPC) (i.e., preeclampsia, intrauterine growth  restriction (IUGR), placental abruption, intrauterine fetal death and recurrent  pregnancy loss). METHODS: A 5-year retrospective cohort study. Ongoing pregnancies in women with  an antecedent PMPC with thrombophilia were compared with the pregnancies in  similar women without thrombophilia. The main outcome measures were mean birth weight deviations, corrected for gestational age, and recurrence of PMPC.  Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was employed for thromboprophylaxis only.

Has Hesperidin any role as a Neuroprotective Agent?,"Yes, hesperidin has a role as a neuroprotective agent. In the given context, it is mentioned that hesperidin exhibits neuroprotective effects against various neurodegenerative processes and related complications in different","Context: dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays.  Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by  measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax,  and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in  rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial  membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced  activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3  and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of  hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function,  and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line., Context: cells. Electron microscopic ultrastructural examination showed marked  mitochondrial swelling, perivascular edema and shrunken nerve cells.  Pretreatment with hesperidin (100 mg/kg) ahead of 3-NP prevented any changes of  locomotor activity or PPI response, slightly increased cortical, striatal and  hippocampal MDA levels by 10% and reduced respective catalase activity by 22%,  20% and 5%. Only few iNOS positive cells were detected in sections from rats  pretreated with hesperidin which also reduced cellular abnormalities induced by  3-NP. This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against  3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Such neuroprotection can be referred to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities., Context:  We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent  for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for  anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress. We found that the intravitreal injection of hesperidin in mice prevented  reductions in markers of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGC death after  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. Hesperidin treatment also reduced calpain activation, reactive oxygen species generation and TNF-α gene  expression. Finally, hesperidin treatment improved electrophysiological  function, measured with visual evoked potential, and visual function, measured, Context: Emerging evidences indicate hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, attenuates  neurodegenerative processes and related complications. Besides its anti-oxidant  properties, the other probable mechanisms which underpin its neuroprotective  potential are still not clear. In light of emerging role of flavonoids in  modulating oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, the study has been designed  to explore the possible neuroprotective effect of hesperidin and its combination with minocycline (microglial inhibitor), against quinolinic acid (QA) induced  Huntington's disease (HD) like symptoms in rats. Unilateral intrastriatal  administration of QA (300 nmol/4 µl) significantly reduced body weight, impaired behavior (locomotor activity, beam balance and memory performance), caused  oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depleted  super oxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), demonstrated mitochondrial, Context: The citrus flavonoid hesperidin exerts neuroprotective effects and could cross  the blood-brain barrier. Given the involvement of glutamate neurotoxicity in the  pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was conducted to  evaluate the potential role of hesperidin in glutamate release and glutamate  neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of rats. In rat hippocampal nerve terminals  (synaptosomes), hesperidin inhibited the release of glutamate and elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but did  not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. The inhibitory effect of hesperidin on  evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions and blocking the activity of Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels  or protein kinase C.

What are reactive metabolites?,"Yes, reactive metabolites are molecules that are formed when drugs undergo metabolic reactions in the body. They can bind to cellular proteins and have been implicated in many idiosyncratic drug reactions. The react","Context: onto the market. Type B reactions are also termed idiosyncratic drug reactions  by many investigators due to their unpredictable nature and our lack of  understanding of the mechanisms involved. It is currently believed that the  majority of these reactions are immune-mediated and are caused by immunogenic  conjugates formed from the reaction of a reactive metabolite of a drug with  cellular proteins. It has been shown that most drugs associated with  idiosyncratic reactions form reactive metabolites to some degree. Covalent  binding of reactive metabolites to cellular proteins has also been shown in many  cases. However, studies to reveal the role of reactive metabolites and their protein-adducts in the mechanism of drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions are  lacking. This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative  views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to  immune-mediated toxicity., Context: characterization of reactive metabolites. In this review, a brief description of  experimental approaches employed for assessing reactive metabolites is followed  by a discussion on the reactivity of acyl glucuronides and acyl coenzyme A  thioesters. Techniques for high-throughput screening and quantitation of  reactive metabolite formation are also described, along with proteomic  approaches used to identify protein targets and modification sites by reactive  metabolites. Strategies for dealing with reactive metabolites are reviewed. In  conclusion, we discuss the challenges and future needs in this field of  research., Context:  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a family of molecules that are continuously  generated, transformed and consumed in all living organisms as a consequence of  aerobic life.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of  dry needling. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite  unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been  reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical  epidural hematoma after dry needling. METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the  T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an  epidural hematoma. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression. CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when  applying needling therapies.

We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain  control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were  epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients  while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits.  Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in  remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete  recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although,  spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be  cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such  complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal  epidural hematoma., Context:  Unintentional acupuncture needling of the thoracic spinal canal produced a  spinal epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Additionally","Context:  Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare disease, and  presents mainly in children. Its cardinal symptoms are achalasia, alacrima, and  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity. We report three cases of Triple A syndrome. Our aim is to inform pediatric surgeons about the existence  of this rare syndrome and to highlight the need for suspicion of alacrima and  ACTH insensitivity in cases of pediatric achalasia. Triple A syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with achalasia. Alacrima should be  investigated by a Schirmer test, and adrenal dysfunction should be tested in  cases of suspected triple A., Context:  The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome.

In one patient with isolated, Context:  Triple-A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder. The 3 features of this syndrome are achalasia, adrenal  insufficiency, and alacrima. Achalasia could be the first manifestation of the triple-A syndrome; however, its etiology is unclear. Alacrima is generally  asymptomatic but can be detected by obtaining patient history. Although adrenal  insufficiency could have manifestations such as asthenia, it might be wrongly diagnosed as muscle fatigue.
