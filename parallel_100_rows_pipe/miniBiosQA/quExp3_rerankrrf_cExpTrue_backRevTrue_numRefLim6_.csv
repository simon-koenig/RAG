What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and carcinogenesis in medulloblastoma. Defective control of the histone code contributes to the development of this malignant pediatric"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context:  Brain tumors encompass a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors with variable  histopathology, aggressiveness, clinical outcome and prognosis. Current gene  expression profiling studies indicate interplay of genetic and epigenetic alterations in their pathobiology. A central molecular event underlying  epigenetics is the alteration of chromatin structure by post-translational  modifications of DNA and histones as well as nucleosome repositioning. Dynamic remodeling of the fundamental nucleosomal structure of chromatin or covalent  histone marks located in core histones regulate main cellular processes  including DNA methylation, replication, DNA-damage repair as well as gene  ,  Context: Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors, of which  glioblastoma is the most malignant form (WHO grade IV), and notorious for  treatment resistance. Over the last decade mutations in epigenetic regulator  genes have been identified as key drivers of subtypes of gliomas with distinct  clinical features. Most characteristic are mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in lower  grade gliomas, and histone 3 mutations in pediatric high grade gliomas that are  also associated with characteristic DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, in  adult glioblastoma patients epigenetic silencing of the DNA repair gene MGMT by  promoter methylation is predictive for benefit from alkylating agent therapy. These epigenetic alterations are used as biomarkers and play a central role for  classification of gliomas (WHO 2016) and treatment decisions. Here we review the  pivotal role of epigenetic alterations in the etiology and biology of gliomas. We summarize the complex interactions between ""driver"" mutations, DNA  methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and overall chromatin  organization, and how they inform current efforts of testing epigenetic  ,  Context: which hinder histone methylation and are implicated in oncogenesis, are recently  identified in several cancer disease and called oncohistones. Well-known  oncohistones, with mutations on both H3.1 and H3.3, include H3K36M in  chondroblastoma, H3K27M in glioma, and H3G34 mutations that exist in bone  cancers and gliomas. Oncohistone expression can lead to epigenome/transcriptome  reprogramming and eventually to oncogenesis. The H3K27M, H3G34V/R, and H3K36M  histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.  Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of H3K27M-driven tumorigenesis has recently  led to the identification of some potential therapeutic targets in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this chapter, we will review and summarize recent  studies on the H3K27M-driven tumorigenic mechanisms and properties and the role  of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones in brain tumors.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that inhibiting STAG1 and STAG2 reduces cell proliferation in cancer cell lines, but no direct connection to"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: events that occurred during evolution of the phylum Chordata, including two  rounds at about the origin of the subphylum Vertebrata (R1 and R2) and one round  before the teleost radiation (R3). Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such  genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: pertaining chromatin structure and dynamics is available (i.e., human and  mouse). However, detailed chromatin knowledge is almost absent in most  organisms, specially protostome animals. Molluscs (which represent sentinel  organisms for the study of pollution) are not an exception to this lack of  knowledge. In the present work we first identified the existence of functionally  differentiated histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis (MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z), a marine organism widely used in  biomonitoring programs. Our results support the functional specialization of  these variants based on: a) their active expression in different tissues, as revealed by the isolation of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in gonad and  hepatopancreas; b) the evolutionary conservation of different residues  encompassing functional relevance; and c) their ability to confer specialization to nucleosomes, as revealed by nucleosome reconstitution experiments using  recombinant MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z histones. Given the seminal role of these  variants in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, their  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE(S): Erythropoiesis is regulated by some extrinsic and intrinsic  factors as microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are endogenously small non-coding  regulatory RNAs which play vital roles in the variety of cellular fate, critical  processes; growth, apoptosis, metabolism, survival of the cells and specially  differentiation. Several miRNAs such as miR-16 and miR-451 have been shown to be  correlated with erythroid differentiation. Taking into account the importance of miRNAs in cellular differentiation, the goal of the present study was to examine  the role of miRNAs in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiation into the  erythroid cells in the absence of growth factors and stimulatory cytokines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD133+ stem cells were infected with lentiviruses  containing miR-451/miR-16 precursor sequence, erythroid differentiation was  evaluated using RT-PCR for hemoglobin chains and surface antigens, also by  banzidine staining.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"There was no significant association between glioblastoma and mobile phone use (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). However, a trend for an increased risk of glioblastoma among the"," Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young  adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the  cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor  cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and  (11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish studies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10). The data from the Swedish studies are  consistent with what would be expected if cellphone use were a risk for brain  tumors, while the Interphone studies data are incredulous. If a risk does exist, the public health cost will be large. These are the circumstances where  application of the Precautionary Principle is indicated, especially if low-cost  options could reduce the absorbed cellphone radiation by several orders of  magnitude.  ,  Context: type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave  increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following  latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association  between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the  initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: Utilization behavior (UB) consists of reaching out and using objects in the  environment in an automatic manner and out of context. This behavior has been  correlated to frontal lobe dysfunction, especially of the right hemisphere. We  describe a 60-year-old woman, affected by a glioblastoma located in the right  frontal region, who presented with intermittent UB of the mobile phone as the  main clinical manifestation of partial complex status epilepticus. Video/EEG  studies showed a striking correlation between mobile phone utilization and ictal  epileptic activity. Clinical and EEG findings were markedly reduced after the  introduction of antiepileptic drugs. This case study suggests that UB may be added to the symptoms described for partial seizures originating from frontal  areas.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel promoter architectures in various genomes.," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone also at https://github.com/computationalBiology/NPLB/ (Mac OSX/Linux). CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: Australia; and had a mean follow-up of 3.7 (SD, 2.8) years. Measured risk  factors for sudden death included family history of sudden death, massive left  ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter  monitoring, and unexplained prior syncope. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Appropriate ICD intervention terminating ventricular  tachycardia or fibrillation. RESULTS: The 506 patients were predominately young (mean age, 42 [SD, 17] years)  at implantation, and most (439 [87%]) had no or only mildly limiting symptoms.  ICD interventions appropriately terminated ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation  in 103 patients (20%). Intervention rates were 10.6% per year for secondary prevention after cardiac arrest (5-year cumulative probability, 39% [SD, 5%]),  and 3.6% per year for primary prevention (5-year probability, 17% [SD, 2%]).  Time to first appropriate discharge was up to 10 years, with a 27% (SD, 7%) probability 5 years or more after implantation. For primary prevention, 18 of  the 51 patients with appropriate ICD interventions (35%) had undergone  implantation for only a single risk factor; likelihood of appropriate discharge  ,  Context: the treatment did not comprise all components specified in the DBT manual or in  the suggestions for inpatient DBT programs, patients failed to be diagnosed  according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the  intervention group comprised fewer than 10 patients. Using a mixed-effect  hierarchical modeling approach, we calculated global effect sizes and effect  sizes for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors.  RESULTS: Calculations of postintervention global effect sizes were based on 16  studies. Of these, 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 8 were  neither randomized nor controlled (nRCT). The dropout rate was 27.3% pre- to posttreatment. A moderate global effect and a moderate effect size for suicidal  and self-injurious behaviors were found, when including a moderator for RCTs  with borderline-specific treatments. There was no evidence for the influence of other moderators (e.g., quality of studies, setting, duration of intervention).  A small impairment was shown from posttreatment to follow-up, including 5 RCTs  only. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should compare DBT with other active  ,  Context: post-implementation; p=0.25). A statistical process control chart demonstrated  immediate and sustained improvement in CTPE yield post-implementation.  Interrupted time series analysis demonstrated the slope of PE findings versus  time to be unchanged before and after the intervention (p=0.9). However, there  was a trend that the intervention was associated with a 50% increased  probability of PE finding (p=0.08), suggesting an immediate rather than gradual  change after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing evidence-based CDS in the ED was associated with an  immediate, significant and sustained increase in CTPE yield without a measurable decrease in CTPE utilization. Further studies will be needed to assess whether  stronger interventions could further improve appropriate use of CTPE.  ,  Context: Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when  developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where  predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on  experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been  renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several  hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been  used for training ID predictors. RESULTS: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on  the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant  amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work  quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is  different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound  ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction  ","26530723, 26081484, 17652294, 21114345, 28970024, 28968848","No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent method for characterizing promoter architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements.",26530723

There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.

The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples.

The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which  measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of  disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond  to chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004  and has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora  M. Hansen, and Barbara Susnik answered questions regarding the incorporation of  the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay into routine clinical practice. This expert  dialog offers an update and clinical insights into when, how, and why clinicians  might incorporate the Oncotype DX assay into the management of their breast cancer patients. Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX  assay in node-positive patients is discussed. Finally, sample case studies offer  clinically relevant examples of the practical application of the Oncotype DX  assay.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: nucleotide changes within the mutation cluster at codons 12 and 13, with a  sequence output in the sense direction to facilitate results interpretation.  These assays were used to determine the mutation status in a prospective series  of 1198 sporadic colorectal cancers. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in  13.2% of the colorectal cancers. The frequency of KRAS mutations in our cohort  was 32.4%, with G>A transitions at position 2 of codons 12 and 13 being most  prevalent. Both assays proved highly sensitive and specific when applied to  clinical specimens, and were applicable to both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded archival tissues. These assays would serve as a suitable platform for large-scale mutation detection in cancer specimens where the  facility for pyrosequencing is available.  ,  Context: the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.

Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases characterized  by the deposition of amyloid-β-protein (Aβ) as senile plaques in the brain  parenchyma and phosphorylated-tau accumulation as neurofibrillary tangles in the  neurons. Although details of the disease pathomechanisms remain unclear, Aβ  likely acts as a key protein for AD initiation and progression, followed by  abnormal tau phosphorylation and neuronal death (amyloid-cascade hypothesis). According to this hypothesis, Aβ immunization therapies are created to eliminate  Aβ from the brain, and to prevent the neurons from damage by these pathogenic  proteins. There are two methods for Aβ immunotherapies: active and passive immunization. Previous studies have shown Aβ removal and improved cognitive  function in animal models of AD. Clinical trials on various drugs, including  AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context: identified a large family with Lewy body parkinsonism linked to a novel locus on  chromosome 4p15 that does not have a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. Here  we report the clinical and neuropathological findings in an individual from this  family and describe unusual high molecular weight alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive  proteins in brain homogenates from brain regions with the most marked  neuropathology. Distinctive histopathology was revealed with alpha-synuclein  immunostaining, including pleomorphic Lewy bodies, synuclein-positive glial  inclusions and widespread, severe neuritic dystrophy. We also discuss the  relationship of this familial disorder to a Lewy body disease clinical spectrum, ranging from Parkinson's disease to dementia with psychosis.  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: One of the most important contributions to our understanding of  neurodegenerative diseases in the last decade has been the demonstration that  several disorders have a common biochemical cause, involving aggregation and  deposition of abnormal proteins. Abnormal protein deposition leads to neuronal  degeneration with consequences to impaired brain function. Protein deposition  can be extracellular (beta-amyloid peptide (A beta), prion protein) or intracellular (Tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin). Individuals with Alzheimer's  disease (AD) exhibit extracellular senile plaques (SPs) of aggregated A beta and  intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that contain hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (NFTs), and also an extensive loss in basal forebrain cholinergic  neurons that innervate the hippocampus and neocortex. The SPs and NFTs  contribute to neurodegeneration, although the mechanisms inducing basal  ","14502650, 23568994, 24465140, 10867800, 1534893, 20942790",Parkinson s disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).," Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: questionnaires were collected, after which the NoSAS score was compared against  the other questionnaires for SDB screening. RESULTS: A total of 2,208 participants were enrolled in this study. The NoSAS  scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of ≥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening. A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck  circumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0%  of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS  model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the  area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703;  0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%:  (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability  of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive  predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the  same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe  OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA  probability for a score of 17.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Pufferfish, specifically species of the genus Takifugu, are associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX)."," Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context: dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to  the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation  with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field  stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter  of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field  stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence  of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  ,  Context: Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins,  tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development. Adults  of some species may be insensitive to toxins but early stages are more prone to  intoxication because they lack effective enzymatic systems to detoxify the  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. It creates a pattern of decreased variation in neighboring loci."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and  ,  Context:  Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has  recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix  quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. The fixation of the beneficial allele  not only affects sequence diversity at single neutral loci but also the joint  allele distribution of several partially linked neutral loci. This distribution can be studied using the ancestral recombination graph for samples of partially  linked neutral loci during the selective sweep. To approximate this graph, we  extend recent work by Etheridge et al. (Ann Appl Probab 16:685-729, 2006) and  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.

Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell  death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy.

In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting  proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic  machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific  proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins  contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition  sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for  their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been  carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of  them in the past 10 years.

Cell viability and onset of apoptosis were  determined with colorimetric assay and immunoblotting analysis, respectively.  The changes in autophagy-related proteins, including LC3, ULK1, AMPK, and LKB,  were determined with immunoblotting analysis in the presence or absence of SFN.  To assess autophagic dynamics, autophagic flux was measured with chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor. The autophagic responsiveness between different HCC cell  lines was compared under the autophagy enhancing conditions. RESULTS: Hep3B cells were significantly more resistant to SFN than Huh7 cells.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation."," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated  ,  Context: permuted-intron-exon sequences, circular forms of the HDV ribozyme, the RNA  component of RNaseP from B. subtilis, the HIV TAR and a short HIV Rev-binding  element were generated and tested for activity and stability. The activity of  circular ribozymes is comparable to the linear counterparts with similar core  sequences. Circular forms of the TAR and Rev-binding element showed specific  binding to Tfr-38 and Rev(35-50) peptide, respectively. To explore the potential  for using this methodology to express circular RNA in vivo, circular forms of  the HDV ribozyme and RNaseP RNA were produced in E. coli. Analysis of total RNA  indicated that the precursor RNA spliced efficiently and accurately to produce circular ribozymes. The activity of in vivo expressed circular ribozymes could  be demonstrated indicating that they fold into active conformation. These  results suggest that self-splicing group I PIE sequences could prove useful for expressing small stable circular ribozyme/decoy-competitor or antisense RNAs in  cells.  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

Vascular  dysfunction is a hallmark of ischemia, cancer, and inflammatory diseases and can  accelerate the progression of diseases. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new type  of noncoding RNAs with covalent bond ring structure, which have been reported to  be abnormally expressed in many human diseases. circRNAs regulate gene expression through the sponging of microRNAs (miRNAs) and can also be used as  disease biomarkers. Here we will summarize the functions of circRNAs in vascular  diseases, including vascular dysfunction, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus-related retinal vascular dysfunction, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary  hypertension, carotid atherosclerotic disease, hepatic vascular invasion in  hepatocellular carcinoma, aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, and type 2  ","32059672, 24339831, 8652136, 33650643, 29028266, 30259375","Circ-ZNF609 is associated with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.

First,  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is not only efficacious against, and has  been licensed for the treatment of HIV (AIDS), but also HBV (hepatitis B).  Second, for the treatment of HIV infections, TDF can be used in combination with  other anti-HIV drugs, such as emtricitabine (combination termed Truvada(®)) and Truvada can be further combined with efavirenz, rilpivirine, elvitegravir,  atazanavir, or darunavir, as a single once-daily oral pill. Third, Truvada can  be used prophylactically to prevent transmission of HIV infection. And fourth, to prevent sexual HIV transmission, tenofovir could also be used topically  (i.e., as a vaginal gel).  ,  Context:  Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral drugs by  HIV-negative people to prevent HIV infection. WHO released new guidelines in  2015 recommending PrEP for all populations at substantial risk of HIV infection. To prepare these guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of values and  preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP, women, heterosexual  men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people and people who inject drugs, and among healthcare  providers who may prescribe PrEP. A comprehensive search strategy reviewed three  electronic databases of articles and HIV-related conference abstracts (January  ,  Context:  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental approach to HIV prevention  and consists of antiretroviral drugs to be taken before potential HIV exposure  in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection and continued during periods of risk. An effective PrEP could provide an additional safety net to sexually  active persons at risk, when combined with other prevention strategies. Women  represent nearly 60% of adults infected with HIV and PrEP can be a female-controlled prevention method for women who are unable to negotiate condom  use.

Moreover, CAB protected macaques from experimental  simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection and showed promising tolerability  in the first trial in humans for preexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection. CAB  might, therefore, provide the basis of the new treatment paradigm of parenteral  treatment and prevention of HIV infection.  ,  Context: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are widely used to treat  HIV-1-infected individuals; indeed most first-line antiretroviral therapies  typically include one NNRTI in combination with two nucleoside analogs.

The topic of this review is how Tibetans have  adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to  altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates  that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose.  Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with  decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude.  Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation  ,  Context: The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological  function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse,  fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase  chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have  been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These  models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship  between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in  genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of  three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.  Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse  genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin  interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive  structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Whether routine screening for depression among nonpregnant women  of reproductive age improves identification and treatment of the disorder  remains unclear.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, it does not. Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context: SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of  Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent  annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage.  Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD),  an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and  growth dysfunctions. In this review, we summarize the main roles of SMARCAL1 in  DNA repair, telomere maintenance and replication fork stability in response to  DNA replication stress.  ,  Context: evidence indicates that initiation from oriK depends on RNA-DNA hybrids  (R-loops), which are normally removed by enzymes such as RNase HI to prevent  oriK from misfiring during normal growth. Initiation from oriK sites occurs in  RNase HI-deficient mutants, and possibly in wild-type cells under certain  unusual conditions. Despite previous work, the locations of oriK and their  impact on genome stability remain unclear. We combined 2D gel electrophoresis  and whole genome approaches to map genome-wide oriK locations. The DNA copy  number profiles of various RNase HI-deficient strains contained multiple peaks,  often in consistent locations, identifying candidate oriK sites. Removal of RNase HI protein also leads to global alterations of replication fork migration  patterns, often opposite to normal replication directions, and presumably  eukaryote-like replication fork merging. Our results have implications for genome stability, offering a new understanding of how RNase HI deficiency  results in R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflict, as well as  inappropriate replication stalling or blockage at Ter sites outside of the  ,  Context: Scientists have been aware for many years of genetic programs that get activated  under stress and produce genetic variants in cells that escape non-proliferating  conditions. These programs are well conserved in all organisms and expand our  view of evolution. They mediate genome instability, create diversity in antibody  formation, expand metabolism and increase fitness of pathogens within host  environments. Error-prone DNA replication and repair are genetic  variability-causing agents that get stimulated by the onset of cellular  stresses. Embedded in these programs is the ability to limit mutagenesis to  defined genomic regions and times, ensuring integrity of most of the genome. Recent evidence suggests that factors involved in RNA polymerase (RNAP)  processivity or transcriptional derepression contribute to the generation of  stress-induced mutations. In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair  and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Central to stationary-phase  mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling  ,  Context:  Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging  disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced  ""progerin"" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression  changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown  that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of  stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA  sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also  ,  Context: in this process. Yet how histones handled by human Asf1 are modified remains  unclear. Here we identify marks on histones H3-H4 bound to Asf1 and changes  induced upon replication stress. In S phase, distinct cytosolic and nuclear  Asf1b complexes show ubiquitous H4K5K12diAc and heterogeneous H3 marks,  including K9me1, K14ac, K18ac, and K56ac. Upon acute replication arrest, the  predeposition mark H3K9me1 and modifications typical of chromatin accumulate in  Asf1 complexes. In parallel, ssDNA is generated at replication sites, consistent  with evicted histones being trapped with Asf1. During recovery, histones stored  with Asf1 are rapidly used as replication resumes. This shows that replication stress interferes with predeposition marking and histone recycling with  potential impact on epigenetic stability.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes."," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation.

The analysis is based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of identification,  classification, description, and numerotation generated from the axioms of the  Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY or IMGT-Kaleidoscope. IMGT/DomainGapAlign provides an invaluable help for antibody engineering and antibody humanization as it  precisely defines the standardized framework regions (FR-IMGT) and  complementarity determining regions (CDR-IMGT) to be grafted.  ,  Context: expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics  translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental  disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created  mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality.  Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered  dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature  transcripts and govern their fate. However, natural IGs manage to maintain  satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the  problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.  ,  Context: synthase(-/-) and p47phox(-/-) mice. Thus we applied transcriptome-profiling  studies to identify genes synergistically upregulated by IFN-gamma and TNF in  macrophages which are potentially involved in the defense against intracellular  pathogens. From a total of 234 regulated genes we found 35 genes that were  upregulated by combined effects of IFN-gamma and TNF and were at least 2-fold  induced. The majority of these genes are involved in signal transduction and  transcriptional regulation. However, we found several genes were poorly  characterized with regard to immunological functions. As a prototypic TNF- and  IFN-gamma-coregulated gene we characterized the expression and the subcellular localization of immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) in murine macrophages. IRG1 is  highly upregulated in murine ANA-1 macrophages by several proinflammatory  cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, as well as in spleen and lung of Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, respectively.  Furthermore, this study identifies 35 genes that constitute the  IFN-gamma/TNF-triggered effector program in innate immunity.  ,  Context: the promoter-proximal Pol llo(ser5) form. Our results also show that ASH2, an  evolutionarily conserved factor that locates at TSS and is required for H3K4me3,  binds and positively regulates dKDM5/LID target genes. However, dKDM5/LID and  ASH2 do not bind simultaneously and recognize different chromatin states,  enriched in H3K4me3 and not, respectively. These results indicate that, at  developmental genes, dKDM5/LID and ASH2 coordinately regulate H3K4me3 at TSS and  that this dynamic regulation contributes to transcription.  ,  Context: SAH levels was not phosphorylated at serine 536, a modification associated with  activation of the transactivation potential of this transcription factor. The  inhibition of transactivation by NF-κB resulted in lower mRNA and protein levels  of the anti-apoptotic protein A20 and increased cleavage of RIP1. CONCLUSIONS: High SAH levels inhibited NF-κB-mediated gene expression and  sensitized primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells to the cytotoxic effects of TNF.  It is likely that crosstalk with other transcription factors is perturbed under  these conditions, resulting in still other changes in gene expression.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a progressive cystic swelling involving muscle produced by recurrent hemorrhage and accompanied by roentgenographic evidence of bone involvement. It is a rare complication of hemophilia, characterized by chronic, slowly expanding, encapsulated"," Context: AIM: Hemophilic pseudotumors result from repeated episodes of bleeding into  bone, subperiosteum, and soft tissue. Since clotting factors became available,  uncontrolled perioperative bleeding is a less significant problem for surgeons  in developed countries. However, they are more difficult to come by in China.  Additionally, patients often have to undergo surgery for giant masses and suffer  complications. We wanted to present our experience in the surgical management of  hemophilic pseudotumors over a 40-year period. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 429 hemorrhagic coagulopathy patients  between 1983 and 2015. Diagnosis of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed following clinical, radiological, and pathological criteria. The data were  recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor,  etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical management and outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen pseudotumor patients underwent surgical treatment. All of them  were male, with mean age of 34.3 years. Fifteen patients had hemophilia A and  ,  Context: the temporal bone and skin of the external ear over the course of 8 years. The  pseudotumor was surgically excised, and the patient's symptoms improved.  Histological examination of a specimen collected from inside the pseudotumor  demonstrated blood products in various stages of evolution and showed that the  outer membrane consisted of a collagen layer. Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare  complications occurring in 1-2% of patients with mild or severe hemophilia.  Pseudotumors are chronic, slowly expanding, encapsulated cystic masses, and most  are located in the long bones and pelvis. The present case suggests that cranial  pseudotumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cranial lesion in a patient with hemophilia.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor has been defined as a progressive cystic swelling  involving muscle which is produced by recurrent hemorrhage and accompanied by  roentgenographic evidence of bone involvement. Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia, and, therefore, we present a case of a six-year-old  male hemophiliac with a cyst in the left distal radius.  ,  Context:  Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best  ,  Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context: months. There was no history of trauma. Examination revealed a swelling over the  right iliac fossa. Right hip showed 30° flexion deformity. Blood investigations  like complete blood count, APTT, PT, bleeding and clotting time, and fibrinogen  were all normal. Plain radiograph and MRI showed a lytic lesion in the right  iliac wing. Excision biopsy of the swelling showed organized hematoma with a  fibrous capsule suggestive of a pseudotumor. Further haematological workup like  factors VIII and IX was normal. At 2 years follow-up, there was no recurrence.  We report this case of pseudotumour in patient without any bleeding disorder.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus. The Athens Protocol demonstrates safe and effective results as a keratoconus management option.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous  melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence  in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors  include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular  melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases.  Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy,  phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination. Ocular outcomes are best with small tumours not extending close to the optic  disc and/or fovea. Almost 50% of patients develop metastatic disease, which  usually involves the liver, and is usually fatal within 1 year. Although UM  ,  Context: delay was, on average, shorter for patients referred directly to an  ophthalmology clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Just under half (48%) of our cohort of CRAO patients were reviewed  by an in-hospital ophthalmologist within the 20-h therapeutic time window for  thrombolytic therapy and thus could qualify for inclusion in a randomized  controlled trial according to EAGLE inclusion criteria. If thrombolysis is  proven to be a feasible and safe treatment in CRAO then public awareness should  be raised of the symptoms and an efficient direct referral pathway to an  in-hospital ophthalmologist established to aid treatment delivery.  ,  Context: 17 to 208) pre-operatively and 76.80 ± 38.41 (range: 7 to 190) up to 3 years  postoperatively. The average Index of Height Decentration was 0.091 ± 0.053 μm  (range: 0.006 to 0.275 μm) preoperatively and 0.057 ± 0.040 μm (range: 0.001 to  0.208 μm) up to 3 years postoperatively. Mean thinnest corneal thickness was  451.91 ± 40.02 μm (range: 297 to 547 μm) preoperatively, 353.95 ± 53.90 μm  (range: 196 to 480 μm) 1 month postoperatively, and 370.52 ± 58.21 μm (range:  218 to 500 μm) up to 3 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The Athens Protocol to arrest keratectasia progression and improve  corneal regularity demonstrates safe and effective results as a keratoconus management option. Progressive potential for long-term flattening validates  using caution in the surface normalization to avoid overcorrection.  ,  Context: revealed macular oedema with cherry red spot pattern. Blood cultures came  positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus in the context of a bacteremia and  native mitral valve vegetation identified on transoesophageal echocardiography.  CRAO of embolic origin was admitted in the context of an infective endocarditis.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. Additionally, mTORC1 regulates STAT3 signaling through Tyr(705) phosphorylation of both STAT"," Context: acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK  phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the  insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor  substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling  was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance. We conclude that the  upregulation of Notch1 expression by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is an  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: SD-1029, a novel inhibitor of Stat3 activation. MTT assay showed that the growth  of all chordoma cell lines was inhibited by SD-1029. The expression of Stat3  signaling cascade was inhibited in all chordoma cell lines after treatment with  SD-1029. The cytotoxicity of the combination of SD-1029 and chemotherapeutic  drugs is significantly better than either agent alone. Phosphorylation of Stat3  in chordoma cells in vitro and cellular proliferation in three-dimensional  culture were inhibited by SD-1029. In conclusion, the Stat3 pathway is  constitutively activated in chordomas and the level of expression may serve as a  predictor for prognosis. Blockade of the Stat3 pathway represents a potential strategy for future treatment.  ,  Context: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is overexpressed or  activated in most types of human tumors and has been classified as an oncogene.  In the present study, we investigated the contribution of the STAT3s to the  proinvasive activity of trefoil factors (TFF) and vascular endothelial growth  factor (VEGF) in human colorectal cancer cells HCT8/S11 expressing VEGF  receptors. Both intestinal trefoil peptide (TFF3) and VEGF, but not pS2 (TFF1),  activate STAT3 signaling through Tyr(705) phosphorylation of both STAT3alpha and  STAT3beta isoforms. Blockade of STAT3 signaling by STAT3beta, depletion of the  STAT3alpha/beta isoforms by RNA interference, and pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3alpha/beta phosphorylation by cucurbitacin or STAT3 inhibitory peptide  abrogates TFF- and VEGF-induced cellular invasion and reduces the growth of  HCT8/S11 tumor xenografts in athymic mice. Differential gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that overexpression of STAT3beta down-regulates  the VEGF receptors Flt-1, neuropilins 1 and 2, and the inhibitor of DNA  binding/differentiation (Id-2) gene product involved in the neoplastic  ,  Context: process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting  HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas  HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A expression. Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 regulate HIF-1α translation, VEGF-A is  primarily under the control of 4E-BP1/eIF4E. S6K1 inhibition reduces HIF-1α but  not VEGF-A expression, suggesting that mTORC1 mediates VEGF-A expression via both HIF-1α-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our work has important  implications for the treatment of vascularised tumours, where mTORC1 acts as a  central mediator of STAT3, HIF-1α, VEGF-A and angiogenesis via multiple  signalling mechanisms.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: ABSTRACT.: Inherited hypokalemic renal tubulopathies are differentiated into at  least three clinical subtypes: (1) the Gitelman variant of Bartter syndrome  (GS); (2) hyperprostaglandin E syndrome, the antenatal variant of Bartter  syndrome (HPS/aBS); and (3) the classic Bartter syndrome (cBS). Hypokalemic  metabolic alkalosis and renal salt wasting are the common characteristics of all  three subtypes. Hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia are specific clinical features of Gitelman syndrome, while HPS/aBS is a life-threatening disorder of the  newborn with polyhydramnios, premature delivery, hyposthenuria, and  nephrocalcinosis. The Gitelman variant is uniformly caused by mutations in the gene for the thiazide-sensitive NaCl-cotransporter NCCT (SLC12A3) of the distal  tubule, while HPS/aBS is caused by mutations in the gene for either the  furosemide-sensitive NaK-2Cl-cotransporter NKCC2 (SLC12A1) or the inwardly  ,  Context: We report a 60-year-old woman with juvenile Parkinson disease (PD) with vocal  cord abductor paralysis (VCAP). She had suffered from juvenile PD for 30 years.  She was admitted in February 1998 to our clinical unit, because of malignant  syndrome induced by dehydration. Neurological examination revealed disturbance  of consciousness, hand tremor, dyskinesia of the trunk and all extremities, and  rigidity. Laboratory examinations disclosed leukocytosis, renal dysfunction, hypermyoglobinemia, and elevation of the serum creatine kinase. Six days after  admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory  distress worsened. Endoscopy of the upper airways revealed that the vocal cord was in the midline or paramedian position. There are some cases of PD with VCAP,  but such a case is very rare in Japan.

Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context:  The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550)  characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery  of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was  based on characteristic clinical features.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: In many animals, the first few hours of life proceed with little or  no transcription, and developmental regulation at these early stages is  dependent on maternal cytoplasm rather than the zygotic nucleus. Translational  control is critical for early Drosophila embryogenesis and is exerted mainly at  the gene level. To understand post-transcriptional regulation during Drosophila  early embryonic development, we used sucrose polysomal gradient analyses and  GeneChip analysis to illustrate the translation profile of individual mRNAs. RESULTS: We determined ribosomal density and ribosomal occupancy of over 10,000  transcripts during the first ten hours after egg laying. CONCLUSION: We report the extent and general nature of gene regulation at the  translational level during early Drosophila embryogenesis on a genome-wide  basis. The diversity of the translation profiles indicates multiple mechanisms modulating transcript-specific translation. Cluster analyses suggest that the  genes involved in some biological processes are co-regulated at the  translational level at certain developmental stages.  ,  Context: Hox clusters because of an additional ""teleost-specific"" genome duplication  event. By sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole  genome, here we provide evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese  lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This suggests that the lamprey lineage has  experienced an additional genome duplication after 1R and 2R. The relative age  of lamprey and human paralogs supports this hypothesis. Compared with  gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are unusually large. Several  conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the Hox clusters of  lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in individual  lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in  elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the  first two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the  lamprey and gnathostome lineages.  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins.

By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.

The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A (CMT1A).

We sequenced the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein  1 gene in 138 patients from 119 unrelated families diagnosed with either  demyelinating or axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We detected six distinct mutant alleles in four families, four of which are novel.  Electrophysiological studies show severely slowed motor nerve conduction  velocities with severely reduced compound muscle action potentials. However, one patient had a normal conduction velocity in the ulnar nerve. Based on the  electrophysiological tests, patients with ganglioside-induced  differentiation-associated protein 1 mutations will therefore be classified as  ,  Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy signified by a distal symmetric  polyneuropathy. The most frequent subtype is type 1A (CMT1A) caused by duplication in chromosome 17p12 that includes PMP22. This study reports a woman  with a family history of CMT1A due to PMP22 duplication. However, she presented  with a more severe phenotype than her sibling or ancestors and was found to have a PMP22 triplication instead of the duplication. This was caused by de novo  mutation on her affected mother's duplication chromosome. Her lower limb  magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe diffused atrophy and fatty  ,  Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular  atrophy (dSMA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized almost  exclusively by degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal  part of the limbs. One subtype, dHMN type V (dHMN-V), is transmitted by  autosomal dominant inheritance and predominantly involves the hands. It is  allelic with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2D (CMT2D), in which a similar phenotype is associated with sensory signs. Missense mutations in the  glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with  either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,"Avapritinib selectively inhibits oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. Specifically, it targets PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including PD"," Context: nausea (59.2%), fatigue (50.0%), periorbital edema (42.0%), anemia (39.2%),  diarrhea (36.0%), vomiting (36.0%), and increased lacrimation (30.8%). No  treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 167 patients starting on 300 mg  avapritinib, all-cause cognitive effects rate (grade 1-2) was 37.0% in all  patients and 52.0% in patients ≥65 years. Cognitive effects improved to a lower  grade more quickly with dose modification (1.3-3.1 weeks) than without  (4.9-7.6 weeks). Median PFS was 11.4 months with dose modification and 7.2  months without. CONCLUSION: Tolerability-guided dose modification of avapritinib is an effective  strategy for managing AEs in patients with GISTs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early recognition of adverse events and tailored dose  modification appear to be effective approaches for managing treatment-related  adverse events and maintaining patients on avapritinib. Dose reduction does not appear to result in reduced efficacy. Patients' cognitive function should be  assessed at baseline and monitored carefully throughout treatment with  avapritinib for the onset of cognitive adverse events. Dose interruption is  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth  factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in addition to the data currently available from early clinical studies as well as  those later-stage trials that led to its approval.  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: Avapritinib (AYVAKIT™) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of  platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop  mutants. It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges. They also play a crucial role in fine"," Context: It is now clear that there is a diversity of circular RNAs in biological  systems. Circular RNAs can be produced by the direct ligation of 5' and 3' ends  of linear RNAs, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, or by  ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context: several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has  led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  the pre‑metastatic niche. Additionally, studies have revealed the mechanism by  which exosomal circRNA affects malignant progression through signal  transduction. Moreover, exosomal circRNA promotes tumor metastasis by regulating gene expression, RNA transcription and protein translation. In this review, the  biological features and clinical application of exosomal circRNA are described,  highlighting the underlying mechanisms through which they regulate tumor metastasis. The application of circRNA as clinical diagnostic biomarkers and in  the development of novel therapeutic strategies is also discussed.  ,  Context:  Most RNAs generated by the human genome have no protein-coding ability and are  termed non-coding RNAs. Among these include circular RNAs, which include exonic  circular RNAs (circRNA), mainly found in the cytoplasm, and intronic RNAs (ciRNA), predominantly detected in the nucleus. The biological functions of  circular RNAs remain largely unknown, although ciRNAs have been reported to  promote gene transcription, while circRNAs may function as microRNA sponges. We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer  cells and were associated with cell cycle progression. Silencing endogenous  circ-Foxo3 promoted cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3  ,  Context:  Long non-coding RNAs are 200 nucleotide long RNA molecules which lack or have  limited protein-coding potential. They can regulate protein formation through  several different mechanisms. Similarly, circular RNAs are reported to play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Changes in the expression  pattern of these molecules are established to underline various diseases,  including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and immunological disorders. Recent studies suggest that they are differentially expressed both in healthy  ocular tissues as well as in eye pathologies, such as neovascularization,  proliferative vitreoretinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, ocular malignancy or even  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated  ,  Context: MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in the initiation  and progression of many tumors. Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs  (circRNAs) have been described in eukaryotic cells:;they comprise a new class of  gene regulators. Naturally occurring circular miR sponges, which induce miR  loss-of-function, can prevent endogenous onco-miRs from binding to their cognate  mRNA targets. These findings suggest that synthetic (artificial) circular RNAs could be constructed as therapeutic molecular sponges to suppress harmful  onco-miRs. Using enzymatic ligation, we designed and constructed a circular RNA  containing both miR-21 and miR-93 binding sites. The synthetic circular sponge was resistant to digestion with RNase R. Luciferase assays and functional  experiments showed that the circular multi-miR sponge was more stable than its  linear counterpart.

Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: 1960 Theodore Maiman built the first Ruby-LASER, starting-point for half a  century of R&D on Biomedical LASER continuous improvement. The purpose of this  paper is to contribute a review of the often disregarded, however, extremely  important Industrial Property documents of LASER-based in vitro Diagnostics  devices. It is an attempt to sketch-out the patent-trail leading towards the  modern Biomedical Laboratory and to offer an introduction to the employment of ""exotic"" systems, such as the Free Electron LASER (FEL), that are expected to  focus on the fundamental processes of life, following chemical reactions and  biological processes as they happen, on unprecedented time and size scales.

Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a malformation of the forebrain that typically results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial anomalies. It can be caused by chromosome aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome,"," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of  ,  Context: Kartagener's syndrome is a very rare congenital malformation comprising of a  classic triad of sinusitis, situs inversus and bronchiectasis. Primary ciliary  dyskinesia is a genetic disorder with manifestations present from early life and  this distinguishes it from acquired mucociliary disorders. Approximately one  half of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have situs inversus and, thus  are having Kartagener syndrome. We present a case of 12 year old boy with  sinusitis, situs inversus and bronchiectasis. The correct diagnosis of this rare  congenital autosomal recessive disorder in early life is important in the  overall prognosis of the syndrome, as many of the complications can be prevented if timely management is instituted, as was done in this in this case.  ,  Context: A role for the Pax-6 homologue eyeless in adult Drosophila brain development and  function is described. eyeless expression is detected in neurons, but not glial  cells, of the mushroom bodies, the medullar cortex, the lateral horn, and the  pars intercerebralis. Furthermore, severe defects in adult brain structures  essential for vision, olfaction, and for the coordination of locomotion are  provoked by two newly isolated mutations of Pax-6/eyeless that result in truncated proteins. Consistent with the morphological lesions, we observe  defective walking behavior for these eyeless mutants. The implications of these  data for understanding postembryonic brain development and function in  Drosophila are discussed.  ,  Context:  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome  affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 persons. It is an autosomal-dominant disorder  with half of the cases resulting from spontaneous mutations. This genetic defect leads to the formation of benign tumors or neurofibromas of the peripheral  nervous system. Dermal neurofibromas may cause local discomfort and itching but  are rarely associated with neurological deficit and do not undergo malignant change.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare condition characterized by dark pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa. It is associated with accumulation of hemosiderin pigment in the lamina propria of the stomach and duodenal villi," Context: significance and long-term sequelae of this entity are unclear. We present a  case of pseudomelanosis duodeni in a 54-year-old woman who presented with a  1-month history of nausea, vomiting and non-bloody diarrhoea. The medical  history was significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease  status postkidney transplant, hypertension, anaemia of chronic disease and  hypothyroidism. A gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed pigmented dark lesions in  the duodenal mucosa. Biopsies from the second part of the duodenum and duodenal  bulb showed pigmented macrophages in the lamina propria. The findings were  consistent with duodenal melanosis. In spite of renal transplant with normalisation of renal function, the duodenal melanosis persists, which raises  questions on the role of renal impairment in this entity.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare condition in which dark pigment accumulates in  macrophages located in the lamina propria of the duodenal mucosa. Three cases  are reported here and the literature is reviewed. No clinical association can be found that points clearly to the underlying etiology. Electron probe x-ray  microanalysis was used to study the pigment in macrophage granules in 2 of our  patients and demonstrated high iron and sulfur content. Iron accumulation in ferritinlike particles was detected in absorptive cell lysosomes. A possible  mechanism for the accumulation of absorbed iron by macrophages is considered.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare entity characterized by dark pigmentation of  duodenal mucosa of uncertain etiology and clinical significance. We report a  case with endoscopic and pathologic correlation. Some aspects about etiology, clinical and histopathologic characteristics are discussed.  ,  Context: 17 years, chronic renal failure for 4 years and gouty arthritis for 3 years.  Panendoscopy was done and showed diffusely scattered small black and brown  pigmentation over the stomach and duodenum. Tissue biopsies from the black  pigmented lesions were taken for further microscopic and histochemical  evaluation. Histological finding and special histochemical stains, Fontana  stain, revealed mild chronic inflammation with accumulation of hemosiderin  pigment in the lamina propria of the stomach and duodenal villi. This condition  is called Pseudomelanosis duodeni. The literature of this condition was also  reviewed.  ,  Context: Pseudomelanosis duodeni is seen endoscopically as dark spots in the duodenal  mucosa and is generally considered to be local deposition of iron from oral iron  intake. However, pseudomelanosis duodeni may be identified histologically even  before it becomes endoscopically evident; iron stainability within the mucosa is  uneven and unpredictable, and multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron  intake may be associated. We reviewed 17 adult patients with histologically  detected pseudomelanosis duodeni, their endoscopic appearances, iron  stainability, and clinical findings including oral iron and drug intake. Only  6/17 (35 %) had endoscopically apparent dark spots. Perl's iron stain was entirely positive in 18 %, partially positive in 64 %, and negative in 18 % of  cases. History of oral iron was present in 76 % of patients, but other clinical  conditions consistently associated were hypertension in 88 %, end stage renal disease in 59 %, and diabetes mellitus in 35 % of patients.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni (PD) is a rare dark speckled appearance of the duodenum  associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, chronic heart failure,  chronic renal failure and consumption of different drugs.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 regulates alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: (TR), a transcriptional activator, affected the regulation of gene expression of  MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase. We hypothesized that myocardial TR signaling  contributes to a molecular mechanism of exercise training-induced improvement of  MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes with cardiac function in old age. We investigated  whether TR signaling and gene expression of MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the aged  heart are affected by exercise training, using the hearts of sedentary young  rats (4 mo old), sedentary aged rats (23 mo old), and trained aged rats (23 mo  old, swimming training for 8 wk). Trained aged rats showed improvement in  cardiac function. Expression of TR-alpha1 and TR-beta1 proteins in the heart were significantly lower in sedentary aged rats than in sedentary young rats and  were significantly higher in trained aged rats than in sedentary aged rats. The  activity of TR DNA binding to the transcriptional regulatory region in the alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes and the mRNA and protein expression of  alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the heart and plasma 3,3'-triiodothyronine and  thyroxine levels were altered in association with changes in the myocardial TR  ,  Context: similar to that in wild-type mice at room temperature. However, at  thermoneutrality, in which the regulation of heart rate switches from  sympathetic to parasympathetic in wild-type mice, TRalpha1+m mice maintained  sympathetic stimulation and failed to activate parasympathetic signaling. Our  findings demonstrate a novel role for TRalpha1 in the adaptation of cardiac  activity by the autonomic nervous system and suggest that human patients with a  similar mutation in TRalpha1 might exhibit a deficit in cardiac adaptation to  stress or physical activity and an increased sensitivity to beta-blockers.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is a rare but serious complication that occurs weeks after exposure to COVID-19, characterized by an overactive immune response, inflammation in different parts of the body, and"," Context:  We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). This adolescent male  presented prior to any known association between COVID-19 and immune mediated inflammatory syndrome in children. He presented in stable condition and without  significant multisystem involvement. During hospitalization, he developed severe  left ventricular dysfunction and mixed hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic shock. Clinical features overlapped with Kawasaki disease, acute rheumatic  fever, and toxic shock syndrome. After centers in Europe began reporting a  multisystem inflammatory condition in children with COVID-19, the patient's  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Recently, severe manifestations associated with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  have been recognized. Analysis of studies for this novel syndrome is needed for  a better understanding of effective management among affected children. METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic  electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers  (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines to retrieve all articles  published from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Observational cross-sectional,  cohort, case series, and case reports were included.  ,  Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition  is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that  share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established at the Public Health Agency of Canada with COVID-19 literature was searched for  articles referencing MIS-C, PIMS or Kawasaki Disease in relation to COVID-19. RESULTS: : A total of 195 out of 988 articles were included in the review. The median age of MIS-C patients was between seven and 10 years of age, although  children of all ages (and adults) can be affected.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

In fact, it has completed phase III clinical trials for acute treatment of migraine, with positive outcomes."," Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use.

In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ubrogepant leading to its first global approval for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and  ,  Context: Ubrogepant (MK-1602) is a novel, oral, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor  antagonist in clinical development with positive phase III outcomes for acute  treatment of migraine. This paper describes the population exposure-response  (E-R) modeling and simulations, which were used to inform the phase III  dose-selection rationale, based on ~ 800 participants pooled across two phase  IIb randomized dose-finding clinical trials. The E-R model describes the placebo  and ubrogepant treatment effects based on migraine pain end points (2-hour pain  relief and 2-hour pain freedom) at various dose levels. Sensitivity analyses  were conducted to evaluate various assumptions of placebo response in light of the high placebo response observed in one phase II trial. A population  pharmacokinetic model describing the effect of formulations was included in the  E-R simulation framework to assess potential dose implications of a formulation switch from phase II to phase III. Model-based simulations predict that a dose  of 25 mg or higher is likely to achieve significantly better efficacy than  placebo with desirable efficacy levels.

(Kenilworth, New Jersey) has recently published an integrated  strategy for implementation of dried blood spots (DBS) in late-stage trials for  population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. We applied this strategy for another  late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was  implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a  phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using  graphical and population PK approaches.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"Filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV), and Marburg virus (MARV) are among the deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks."," Context: them, e. g. encephalitic diseases, are severe and associated with a high  mortality. Measles are world-wide distributed and belong to the ten most  frequent infectious diseases in some less developed countries. The disease is  associated with a high mortality in some African and South-East Asian countries,  in particular in children aged less than 12 months. Of particular note, measles  are the most important cause of blindness in children in population with  borderline vitamin A status. In Germany, the number of reported measles cases  has been declined dramatically since the introduction of a vaccine more than  four decades ago. However, regional outbreaks or small epidemics still occur. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment, therapy of measles is  symptomatic and depends on the manifestation of the disease. The most important  prevention strategy is immunization with a life-attenuated vaccine that can be applied as monovaccination or in combination with mumps and rubella virus (MMR  vaccination) or mumps, rubella and varicella virus (MMRV vaccination).  ,  Context:  SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different  geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah  virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not  match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV),  which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an  animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the  possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused  ,  Context:  The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context: both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and  flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of  wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do  not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue  virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a  human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and  capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause  widespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential,  these viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because  some of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious,  special containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.  ,  Context: Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with  mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%. Despite numerous efforts to  identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between  the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an  increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology. The high mortality  rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has  propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat. This  article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic  potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment of future outbreaks, which would help prevent the evolution of filovirus into  more virulent and more transmissible viruses.  ,  Context: Bluetongue virus (BTV) genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments. The  sequence of the plus strand of each of the BTV genomic double-stranded RNAs is  the same as that of its mRNA, which encodes for a single viral protein, except  the smallest S4 segment which can encode for two nonstructural proteins,  primarily for the release assistance of the viral progeny. The separation and  isolation of each BTV dsRNA segment and viral protein have provided extensive  data related to its viral infection, pathology, suppression of host cellular  functions, and eventual apoptosis of the infected host cells. This cytoplasmic  virus is also an animal killer that costs the U.S. livestock industry at least $125 million yearly. However, this virus has no known effect on humans. Thus, it  is very safe to carry out investigation with the virus, preferably in a BSL-2  laboratory.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine receptors.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context: (fenebrutinib and Lou064), a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and dupilumab.  Promising targets of future therapies include the Mas-related G-protein-coupled  receptor X2; the histamine4 receptor; C5a and its receptor; inhibitory mast cell  receptors other than Siglec-8; interleukin 33, interleukin 25, and thymic  stromal lymphopoietin, and stem cell factor. CONCLUSION: Novel and better treatments for CU are very much needed. Some agents  are in clinical trials already (eg, ligelizumab), and additional ones should be  developed, making use of the many promising targets recently identified and  characterized.  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: explosion of biological therapies, particularly four of them very useful for  internists (in an off label use) : Interleukin 1 inhibitors (anakinra,  Canakinumab) to treat some auto inflammatory diseases (cryopirin associated  periodic syndromes and deficency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist),  monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5 (mepolizumab) to treat some  hypereosinophilic syndromes and Churg and Strauss angiitis, interleukin 6  inhibitiors to treat multifocal Castleman's disease and adult Still disease, a  monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (Bevacizumab) to  treat hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  ,  Context: Asthma is an inflammatory disease which affects millions of people worldwide.  Therefore, it is necessary to search for new sources of therapies for the  treatment of these patients in order to improve their quality of life. From  content analysis of literature of new therapeutic targets, there are various  targets and drugs reported to be promising for the treatment of asthma.  Interleukins involved in inflammatory processes are often presented as candidate  targets for new drugs. The action of such therapeutics would not only affect  interleukins, but also their receptors. Small molecules (e.g. ligustrazine and  SP600125) and large molecule antibodies (e.g. lebrikizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab) are being considered as novel agents for the pharmacotherapy of  asthma. Therefore, through this research, we can see advances in the search for  new targets and promising drugs to treat asthma.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation. Additionally, MEC-17 is"," Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling. Microtubule composed  of tubulins regulates cell shape, migration and survival. Tubulin acetylation  has an important role in the control of microtubule structure and microtubule-based cellular functions. In this study, angiotensin II induced  disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment  with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using  RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin  II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development.

However, the ERG considered that the base-case sequence proposed by the company represented a limited set of potentially relevant treatment sequences and  positions for apremilast. The company's base-case results were therefore not a  sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be both pro-tumoral and antitumor, but recent evidence suggests that they can be re-educated toward an antitumor phenotype. Targeting TAMs has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, making them a potential valuable"," Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: In the last decade, it has been well-established that tumor-infiltrating myeloid  cells fuel not only the process of carcinogenesis through cancer-related  inflammation mechanisms, but also tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis.  In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant  leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a  protective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an  immune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to  allow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional  therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit cancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also  responsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint  inhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to deplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as  weapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the  reprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral  ,  Context: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial part in cancer evolution.  Dynamic imaging of TAMs is of great significance for treatment outcome  evaluation and precision tumor therapy. Currently, most fluorescence nanoprobes  tend to accumulate in the liver and are difficult to metabolize, which leads to  strong background signals and inadequate imaging quality of TAMs nearby the  liver such as pancreatic cancer. Herein, we aim to develop metabolizable dextran-indocyanine green (DN-ICG) nanoprobes in the second near-infrared window  (NIR-II, 1 000-1 700 nm) for dynamic imaging of TAMs in pancreatic cancer.  Compared to free ICG, the NIR-II fluorescence intensity of DN-ICG nanoprobes increased by 279% with significantly improved stability. We demonstrated that  DN-ICG nanoprobes could specifically target TAMs through the interaction of  dextran with specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin related 1 (SIGN-R1), which  ,  Context: receptor function can contribute to a number of disease states, including  coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and cancer. In this  chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation,  biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In  addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in  oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human  cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for  targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are  described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes"," Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive  ,  Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context: Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to  ,  Context: Donor-matched transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is widely used  to treat hematologic malignancies but is associated with high mortality. The  expansion of HSC numbers and their mobilization into the bloodstream could  significantly improve therapy. We report here that adult mice conditionally  deficient for the transcription Growth factor independence 1b (Gfi1b) show a  significant expansion of functional HSCs in the bone marrow and blood. Despite this expansion, Gfi1b(ko/ko) HSCs retain their ability to self-renew and to  initiate multilineage differentiation but are no longer quiescent and contain  elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Treatment of Gfi1b(ko/ko) mice with N-acetyl-cystein significantly reduced HSC numbers indicating that increased  reactive oxygen species levels are at least partially responsible for the  expansion of Gfi1b-deficient HSCs. Moreover, Gfi1b(-/-) HSCs show decreased  ,  Context: difference in Meis1 levels between controls and mutants. Transfection  experiments further demonstrated specific repression of meis1 promoter driven  reporters by wild type Gfi1b but neither by a SNAG domain mutant nor by a DNA  binding deficient one, thus confirming direct functional regulation of this  promoter by the Gfi1b transcriptional complex. Overall, our results demonstrate  direct yet differential regulation of meis1 transcription by Gfi1b in distinct  hematopoietic lineages thus revealing it to be a common, albeit lineage  specific, target of both Gfi1b and its paralog Gfi1.

It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease.

The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies.

AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of  15 adult patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 ± 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and  July 2010. RESULTS: The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope  in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>.

Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients. Left ventricular non-compaction diagnosis is  ,  Context:  Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle (LV) is a rare disorder, classified  as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association. The  European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases classified LV noncompaction as an unclassified cardiomyopathy. LV  noncompaction cardiomyopathy characterized by the following features: 1) an  altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of  compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left  ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984.

METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context:  Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare congenital  cardiomyopathy that affects both children and adults.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context: (one-third of the species analyzed) or multisegmental (the rest). Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution. The definition of  species-specific cGOFs provides powerful guidance for genome assembly and other  structure-based analysis.  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context: To elucidate the behavior of DNA polymerase eta against the oxidized purine  nucleotides, we determined the utilization efficiency of 2-hydroxy-dATP and  8-hydroxy-dGTP by the recombinant yeast DNA polymerase eta using the primer  extension assay with the synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers, and  compared those by DNA polymerase alpha. Results indicate that DNA polymerase eta  incorporates 2-hydroxy-dATP opposite template G in addition to template T and 8-hydroxy-dGTP opposite A in addition to C, respectively. Kinetic analysis  revealed that the rate of mutation caused by 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP with DNA  polymerase eta should be much higher than those with DNA polymerase alpha.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. Additionally, Rif1 interacts"," Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: Gene and genome duplication are the major sources of biological innovations in  plants and animals. Functional and transcriptional divergence between the copies  after gene duplication has been considered the main driver of innovations .  However, here we show that increased phenotypic plasticity after duplication  plays a more major role than thought before in the origin of adaptations. We  perform an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional alterations of duplicated  genes in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae when challenged with  five different environmental stresses. Analysis of the transcriptomes of yeast  shows that gene duplication increases the transcriptional response to environmental changes, with duplicated genes exhibiting signatures of adaptive  transcriptional patterns in response to stress. The mechanism of duplication  matters, with whole-genome duplicates being more transcriptionally altered than small-scale duplicates. The predominant transcriptional pattern follows the  classic theory of evolution by gene duplication; with one gene copy remaining  unaltered under stress, while its sister copy presents large transcriptional  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.

G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism.

We further demonstrate that knockdown of GSEC results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context:  Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing  and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two  main G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4  affinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of  ,  Context: DNA replication. In addition, G-quadruplex binding proteins also affect the  structure and function of G-quadruplexes. Some chemically synthesized  G-quadruplex sequences have been shown to have biological activities. For  example, bimolecular G-quadruplexes of AS1411 act as targets of exogenous drugs  that inhibit the proliferation of malignant tumours. G-quadruplexes are also  used as vehicles to deliver nanoparticles. Thus, it is important to identify the  factors that influence G-quadruplex structures and maintain the stability of  G-quadruplexes. Herein, we mainly discuss the factors influencing G-quadruplexes  and the synthetic G-quadruplex, AS1411. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This review summarizes the factors that influence G-quadruplexes and the functions of the  synthetic G-quadruplex, AS1411. It also discusses the use of G-quadruplexes for  drug delivery in tumour therapy.  ,  Context: G-Quadruplex, a unique secondary structure in nucleic acids found throughout  human genome, elicited widespread interest in the field of therapeutic research.  Being present in key regulatory regions of oncogenes, RNAs and telomere,  G-Quadruplex structure regulates transcription, translation, splicing, etc.  Changes in its structure and stability leads to differential expression of  oncogenes causing cancer. Thus, targeting G-Quadruplex structures with small molecules/other biologics has shown elevated research interest.

Applying CLIPPER to the analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high  confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization  and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.  ,  Context: RESULTS: We present here an R package for the statistical analysis of ChIP-seq  experiments.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein is a transcriptional co-repressor that does not bind DNA directly but is recruited by a diverse profile of transcription factors. It has five identifiable regions, including the highly conserved amino-terminal glut"," Context:  The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata. The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing  ,  Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a  conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic  helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination.

But is there any specificity? This review tries to make a case for a  non-redundant function of individual TLE/Grg proteins.

This  review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely  to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: X-linked hypophosphatemia is characterized by increased secretion of  fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to hypophosphatemia and  consequently rickets, osteomalacia, and skeletal deformities. We investigated  burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked  hypophosphatemia. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with  X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab  either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum  phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity  total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease  severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional  end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical  ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events.  ,  Context: were confirmed. Plasma phosphate returned to normal values 90 days after the  iron administration. (ii) A 40-year-old man with a history of CML in whom  imatinib was started. He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating  drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context: Phosphate plays essential roles in many biological processes, and the serum  phosphate level is tightly controlled. Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired  mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia.  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates  phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired  phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired  FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked  hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most  prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another  clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is  ,  Context: abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"No, deregulation of H4K20 methylation has no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. However, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage specifically limited to late replic"," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: regulated or how it contributes to these diverse processes. Metabolic labeling  and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H4 is progressively  methylated at K20 during the G(2), M, and G(1) phases of the cell cycle in a  process that is largely inescapable and irreversible. Approximately 98% of new  H4 becomes dimethylated within two to three cell cycles, and K20 methylation  turnover in vivo is undetectable. New H4 is methylated regardless of prior  acetylation, and acetylation occurs predominantly on K20-dimethylated H4,  refuting the hypothesis that K20 methylation antagonizes H4 acetylation and  represses transcription epigenetically. Despite suggestions that it is required for normal mitosis and cell cycle progression, K20 methylation proceeds normally  during colchicine treatment. Moreover, delays in PR-Set7 synthesis and K20  methylation which accompany altered cell cycle progression during sodium butyrate treatment appear to be secondary to histone hyperacetylation or other  effects of butyrate since depletion of PR-Set7 did not affect cell cycle  progression. Together, our data provide an unbiased perspective of the  ,  Context: SU(VAR)3-9 like histone methyltransferases control heterochromatic domains in  eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, 10 SUVH genes encode SU(VAR)3-9 homologues where  SUVH1, SUVH2 and SUVH4 (KRYPTONITE) represent distinct subgroups of SUVH genes.  Loss of SUVH1 and SUVH4 causes weak reduction of heterochromatic histone H3K9  dimethylation, whereas in SUVH2 null plants mono- and dimethyl H3K9, mono- and  dimethyl H3K27, and monomethyl H4K20, the histone methylation marks of Arabidopsis heterochromatin are significantly reduced. Like animal SU(VAR)3-9  proteins SUVH2 displays strong dosage-dependent effects. Loss of function  suppresses, whereas overexpression enhances, gene silencing, causes ectopic heterochromatization and significant growth defects. Furthermore, modification  of transgene silencing by SUVH2 is partially transmitted to the offspring  plants. This epigenetic stability correlates with heritable changes in DNA  ,  Context: environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context:  Histone modification plays important roles in many biological processes such as  development and carcinogenesis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is  commonly associated with transcriptional activation of genes. H3K4 methylation in mammalian cells is carried out by COMPASS (complex of proteins associated  with Set1)-like complexes that are composed of catalytic subunits such as MLL1  (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) and multiple regulatory subunits in which WDR5 (WD40 repeat-containing protein 5), RBBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 5), ASH2  (absent, small or homoeotic discs 2) and DPY30 [constituting the WRAD  sub-complex (WDR5-ASH2-RBBP5-DPY30 complex)] are the major ones shared from  ","27131378, 19571682, 17967882, 15775980, 23345616, 25706881","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context: ABSTRACT: Mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the human voltage-gated chloride  ClC-Kb (hClC-Kb) channel cause classic Bartter's syndrome (BS). In contrast to  antenatal BS, classic BS manifests with highly variable phenotypes. The  functional severity of the mutant channel has been proposed to explain this  phenomenon. Due to difficulties in the expression of hClC-Kb in heterologous  expression systems, the functional consequences of mutant channels have not been  thoroughly examined, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been  established. In this study, we found that hClC-Kb, when expressed in human  embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, was unstable due to degradation by proteasome. In-frame fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of the  channel may ameliorate proteasome degradation. Co-expression of barttin  increased protein abundance and membrane trafficking of hClC-Kb and markedly increased functional chloride current. We then functionally characterized 18  missense mutations identified in our classic BS cohort and others using HEK  cells expressing hClC-Kb-GFP. Most CLCNKB mutations resulted in marked reduction  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds. The parents and siblings of each patient, as well as a population of 300 healthy control adult subjects, were also analyzed. All ten patients were  found to be homozygous for an identical missense mutation in the CLCNKB gene,  substituting a threonine for an alanine at codon 204 (A204T) in the putative  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Classic Bartter syndrome is a salt-wasting tubulopathy caused by  mutations in the CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb) gene. Although growth hormone  deficiency has been suggested as a cause for persistent growth failure in  patients with classic Bartter syndrome, in our opinion the diagnoses of growth  hormone deficiency has been unconvincing in some reports. Moreover, Gitelman  syndrome seems to have been confused with Bartter syndrome in some cases in the literature. In the present work, we describe a new case with CLCNKB gene  mutations and review the reported cases of classic Bartter syndrome associated  with growth hormone deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a Japanese boy diagnosed as having classic  Bartter syndrome at eight months of age. The diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was  confirmed by CLCNKB gene analysis, which revealed compound heterozygous  ,  Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants.

Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome  and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context: Mutations leading to salt losing tubulopathies are not routinely tested in  Indian population. The authors have done the genetic analysis for the first time  in the Bartter syndrome on two cases from India. First case was antenatal  Bartter syndrome presenting with massive polyuria and hyperkalemia. Mutational  analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in KCNJ1(ROMK) gene  [p(Leu220Phe), p(Thr191Pro)]. Second case had a phenotypic presentation of  classical Bartter syndrome however, genetic analysis revealed only heterozygous  novel mutation in SLC12A gene p(Ala232Thr).

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded  by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many  eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral  protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Dosage  ,  Context: the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Andexanet alfa (r-Antidote,  PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) is a truncated form of enzymatically  inactive factor Xa, which binds and reverses the anticoagulant action of the  factor Xa inhibitors (e.g.: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban). Aripazine  (PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) is a synthetic small molecule (~500 Da)  that reverses oral dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, as well as subcutaneous  fondaparinux and LMWH in vivo. These antidotes could provide an alternative for  management of life-threatening bleeding events occurring with the  above-mentioned anticoagulants. In addition, the specific antidote anivamersen (RB007; Regado Biosciences Inc.) is an RNA aptamer in clinical development to  reverse the anticoagulant effect of the parenteral factor IXa inhibitor  pegnivacogin, which is also in development. This anticoagulant-antidote pair may provide an alternative in situations in which a fast onset and offset of  anticoagulation is needed, like in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with  extracorporeal circulation, as an alternative to the heparin/protamine pair.  ,  Context: Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with  significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was reached  in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.1 mmol/L was reached in  26.97% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 19.33% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of FPG ≤7.0 mmol/L was reached in 63.16% of patients in  Avandamet treatment and 43.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. Fasting  insulin decreased 3.24 ± 0.98 μU/ml from baseline in Avandamet treatment and  0.72 ± 1.10 μU/ml in uptitrated metformin treatment. Overall adverse event (AE) rates and serious AE rates were similar between groups. Hypoglycaemia occurred  rarely in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with uptitrated metformin, Avandamet treatment provided significant improvements in key parameters of glycemic control and was generally  well tolerated. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-TRC-13003776.  ,  Context: treatment delays, treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to  these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving  amifostine versus patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

This approach has been demonstrated to have therapeutic potential for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy by targeting dystroph"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA.

Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria  is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed  Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal  posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations).

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: tablet. Three tablet strengths are being developed so as to cover the most  common clinical dosing needs. In September 2000, Orion signed a marketing and  distribution agreement with Novartis for the combination tablet. Under the terms  of the agreement, Orion has exclusive marketing rights for the product in  Germany, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic and Baltic countries, and several Eastern  European countries. Novartis has exclusive rights to the US and territories  other than those markets for which Orion holds market exclusivity. Orion also  has the option to co-promote the product in France, Spain and several other  countries. In June 2003, the US FDA approved the entacapone/levodopa/carbidopa combination tablet (Stalevo) for the treatment of patients with idiopathic  Parkinson's disease who experience signs and symptoms of end-of-dose 'wearing  off'. Market launch of the product is expected toward the end of 2003 in the US. Also in June 2003, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the  European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products adopted a positive  opinion of the combination tablet.

However, some individuals remain at high risk for  the progression of COVID-19. In the US, the FDA has given Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA) for two neutralizing therapeutic monoclonal antibody  'cocktails,' casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV), bamlanivimab and etesevimab,  and one monotherapy, bamlanivimab, for prophylactic post-exposure therapy in  individuals at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Preclinical and  clinical studies showed consistent effectiveness of REGEN-COV against current  variants of SARS-CoV-2. On 21st November 2020, the FDA approved an initial EUA for REGEN-COV to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and in children 12  years or older with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at high risk for progression to  severe COVID-19. On 30th July 2021, the FDA updated its EUA for REGEN-COV for emergency use as post-exposure prophylactic to prevent COVID-19 progression in  adults and children aged 12 years or older.

Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.  ,  Context: the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or  somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or  more chemotherapies.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was expressed in 9 out of 14 NSCLC cell lines examined, and neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) mRNA was detected in all 14 NSCLC cell lines."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context:  Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists. PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.  Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and  ,  Context: Tandem repeats are found in both coding and non-coding sequences of higher  organisms. These sequences can be used in cancer genetics and diagnosis to  unravel the genetic basis of tumor formation and progression. In this study, a  possible relationship between SSR distributions and lung cancer was studied by  comparative analysis of EST-SSRs in normal and lung cancerous tissues. While the  EST-SSR distribution was similar between tumorous tissues, this distribution was different between normal and tumorous tissues. Trinucleotides tandem repeats  were highly different; the number of trinucleotides in ESTs of lung cancer was 3  times higher than normal tissue. Significant negative correlation between normal and cancerous tissue showed that cancerous tissue generates different types of  trinucleotides. GGC and CGC were the more frequent expressed trinucleotides in  cancerous tissue, but these SSRs were not expressed in normal tissue. Similar to  ,  Context:  Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous  physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array  of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A.  PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies. Although the part  of PAR1&2 in cancer is on the rise, their underlying signaling events are poorly understood. We review hereby past, present, and future cancer-associated PAR  biology.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context:  We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  ,  Context:  A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962  explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different  bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life.

Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings.

The apparent  discrepancy between expected and observed incidence of BRCA2 mutation-associated  FA in high-frequency carrier populations has important implications for the  genetic counselling of couples with recurrent miscarriages from high-risk  populations.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the  ,  Context: death 10) as the CCM3 gene. The CCM3 locus has been previously mapped to 3q26-27  within a 22-cM interval that is bracketed by D3S1763 and D3S1262. We  hypothesized that genomic deletions might occur at the CCM3 locus, as reported  previously to occur at the CCM2 locus. Through high-density microsatellite  genotyping of 20 families, we identified, in one family, null alleles that  resulted from a deletion within a 4-Mb interval flanked by markers D3S3668 and  D3S1614. This de novo deletion encompassed D3S1763, which strongly suggests that  the CCM3 gene lies within a 970-kb region bracketed by D3S1763 and D3S1614. Six  additional distinct deleterious mutations within PDCD10, one of the five known genes mapped within this interval, were identified in seven families. Three of  these mutations were nonsense mutations, and two led to an aberrant splicing of  exon 9, with a frameshift and a longer open reading frame within exon 10. The last of the six mutations led to an aberrant splicing of exon 5, without  frameshift. Three of these mutations occurred de novo. All of them cosegregated  with the disease in the families and were not observed in 200 control  ,  Context: families, including identification of 25 (19 novel) mutant alleles (12 in CCDC39  and 13 in CCDC40). All the mutations were nonsense, splice, and frameshift  predicting early protein truncation, which suggests this defect is caused by  ""null"" alleles conferring complete protein loss. Most families (73%; 27/37) had  homozygous mutations, including families from outbred populations. A major  putative hotspot mutation was identified, CCDC40 c.248delC, as well as several  other possible hotspot mutations. Together, these findings highlight the key  role of CCDC39 and CCDC40 in PCD with axonemal disorganization and IDA loss, and  these genes represent major candidates for genetic testing in families affected by this ciliary phenotype. We show that radial spoke structures are largely  intact in these patients and propose this ciliary ultrastructural abnormality be  referred to as ""IDA and microtubular disorganisation defect,"" rather than ""radial spoke defect.""

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"Med220 and Med70 subunits are part of the CRSP/Med complex. Additionally, a stable endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the Med220 and the Med70 subunits has been"," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin  family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute  inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker  of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that  CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a  native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury  it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells  and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric  subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both  classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q  and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte  recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T  cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density  ,  Context: The neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent acute  toxins known and are the causative agents of the neuroparalytic disease  botulism. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by  blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are  seven distinct serotypes of toxin. All are polypeptides of Mr about 150 kDa that  have similar structure and pharmacological action. In their most active forms the toxins exist as dichain molecules in which a heavy (H) chain is linked by  disulphide bonding to a light (L) chain. The H chain is believed to be  associated with the highly specific and avid binding of toxin to the motor nerve end plates and also with the process of internalisation of the toxin. The toxic  activity appears to be associated with the L chain which blockades the  calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering at the  ,  Context: Heart and kidney are closely interacting organs which function interdependently.  Organ crosstalk between these two organs is based on humoral regulation and by  inflammatory mediators, which are similar to those dominating systemic  inflammation syndrome. The close interaction between heart and kidney results in  organ dysfunction following both chronic and acute functional impairment of the  respective counterpart. These changes are summarized under the term cardiorenal  syndrome (CRS) which is subdivided into 5 types. In the setting of emergency  medicine and intensive care units, CRS types 1 and 3 are the most common. CRS  type 1 is characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI) developing as a consequence of acute heart failure. CRS type 3 is represented by acute cardiac failure  following AKI, often occurring as a consequence of nephrotoxins. Diagnosis of  CRS should preferably be made on basis of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for the diagnosis and staging of AKI. The cardiac  diagnostic workup should include echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG),  cardiac enzymes, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is evident from the fact that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macroph"," Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: Exosomes are a type of cell-derived extracellular nanovesicle. They relay  information between cells. Some known exosome functions include immune  modulation, promotion of angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. To date, clinical  use of exosomes has focused predominantly on evaluating their efficacy as cancer  vaccines or diagnostically as biomarker containers. However, few investigations  have explored their potential to serve as a platform for the development of  semi-synthetic nanovesicles. Given their nanoscale size, potential to express  targeting ligands in native conformations and deformable structure, exosomes  offer a logical biological vesicle platform for adapting and producing semi-synthetic vesicles with excellent potential for nanomedicine applications.  However, there are obstacles associated with realizing this potential that must  be addressed. Thus, a systematic approach to isolating, modifying, and testing exosomes is presented to facilitate the introduction of exosome-based  translational nanomedicine.  ,  Context: Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus plays one key role as an immobilized  affinity ligand for the purification of antibodies. A simple method for its  extracellular expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification is  reported herein. The N-terminus of the gene coding for the five IgG binding  domains was fused to a pelB signal peptide which is responsible for periplasmic  localization and which is removed after translocation into the periplasmic space  of E.coli. Different additives, which were added at the same time with the  induction of the protein expression by IPTG, were tested in order to facilitate  the release of the target protein. With help of this optimized release protocol, more than 380mgL(-1) of protein A were obtained when Tris-HCl pH 8.5 was added  up to a final concentration of 180mM in shaking flask experiments. Based on  these observations, a protocol was developed for the extracellular production of SpA in a stirred tank bioreactor yielding 5.5gL(-1) of the secreted target  protein. After cell removal by centrifugation, the protein A-containing  supernatant was concentrated and dialyzed by tangential flow filtration.

Here, we show that small lipid vesicles called exosomes, secreted in  the extracellular milieu by cortical neurons, carry endogenous APP and are strikingly enriched in CTF-α and the newly characterized CTF-η.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMPK activity regulates stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK-α2 isoform associates with stress granules in response to various stressors, and pharmacological inhibition of AMPK interferes with stress granule formation."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context:  Rbfox RNA-binding proteins play important roles in the regulation of alternative  pre-mRNA splicing, but their role in other gene regulatory mechanisms is not  well understood. Here, we show that Rbfox2 is a novel constituent of cytoplasmic stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to  cellular stress. We also show that the RNA binding activity of the Rbfox family  protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to  identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a  subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While  there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains  modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate  that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties  of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for  mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA (Poly(A)polymerase-alpha) is a mammalian polyadenylating enzyme responsible for adding adenosine nucleotides to the 3'-end of RNA, generating a poly(A) tail up to 250-"," Context:  The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their  stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation. Subsequently, the balance  between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is  essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to  neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to  RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the  turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other  ,  Context: Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the  3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up  to 250-300 nucleotides long. In the first section of our review, we consider the  classical process of mRNA 3'-terminus formation, which involves the cleavage of  the transcript synthesized by RNA polymerase II and the associated poly(A) tail  synthesis by canonical polyadenylate polymerase. Nucleotide sequences needed for mRNA cleavage and poly(A) tail synthesis, in particular the AAUAAA  polyadenylation signal, as well as numerous proteins and their complexes  involved in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, is described in detail. The significance of the poly(A) tail for prolonging mRNA lifetime and stimulating  their translation is discussed.

Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  ,  Context: Poly(A) tails of mRNAs are synthesized in the cell nucleus with a defined  length, approximately 250 nucleotides in mammalian cells. The same type of  length control is seen in an in vitro polyadenylation system reconstituted from  three proteins: poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity  factor (CPSF), and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1). CPSF, binding  the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA, and PABPN1, binding the growing poly(A) tail, cooperatively stimulate poly(A) polymerase such that a complete poly(A) tail is  synthesized in one processive event, which terminates at a length of  approximately 250 nucleotides. We report that PABPN1 is required to restrict CPSF binding to the AAUAAA sequence and to permit the stimulation of poly(A)  polymerase by AAUAAA-bound CPSF to be maintained throughout the elongation  reaction.

CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns.

Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: with arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death due to functional exclusion of  the right ventricle. Molecular genetic studies have identified nine different  loci associated with ARVC; accordingly each locus is implicated for each type of  ARVC (ARVC1-ARVC9). So far five genes have been identified as containing  pathogenic mutations for ARVC. Though mutations in each of the gene/s indicate  disruption of different pathways leading to the condition, the exact  pathogenesis of the condition is still obscure. This review tries to understand  the pathogenesis of the condition by examining the individual proteins  implicated and relate them to the pathways that could play a role in the aetiology of the condition. Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR-2), which regulates  intra-cellular Ca(2+) concentration by releasing Ca(2+) reserves from the  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), was the first gene for ARVC. The mutation in this gene is believed to disrupt coupled gating of RYR-2, causing  after-depolarisation, leading to arrhythmias followed by structural changes due  to altered intra-cellular Ca(2+) levels. Three other genes implicated for ARVC,  ,  Context: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac arrhythmia that may lead to  sudden death in patients with structurally normal heart. Mutations in the alpha  subunit of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A gene are found in approximately 20%  of cases.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have failed to," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: consequent release of bradykinin. Ecallantide (known as DX-88 previously), a  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein is an innovative medicinal  product. This is the only agent approved recently by the FDA for all  localizations of edematous HAE attacks. Its advantages include no risk of viral  contamination, high selectivity, very rapid onset of action, good tolerability,  and straightforward subcutaneous administration. Owing to the risk of  anaphylaxis, ecallantide should be administered by a health care professional. A  postmarketing survey to improve risk-assessment and risk-minimization has been  launched. The results of these studies may lead to the approval of ecallantide for self-administration.  ,  Context: BS, including evaluations of quality attributes, nonclinical and clinical  studies was performed in accordance with ""Policies on Assurance of Quality,  Safety and Efficacy of Biosimilars"". The quality attributes of Etanercept BS  were similar to those of Enbrel, and the binding affinities to TNFα/LTα, TNFα  neutralizing activity, nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicological profiles  of Etanercept BS were comparable to Enbrel. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic  profile and efficacy of Etanercept BS were equivalent to those of Enbrel and  there was no clinically significant difference in safety profiles between them  in Phase I and Phase III clinical studies. The marketing approval application of the Etanercept BS with the same indications as Enbrel filed by Mochida  Pharmaceutical was approved in January 2018 and the products will be launched by  Ayumi Pharmaceutical in the near future. The Etanercept BS, which is as highly effective as Enbrel is expected to make beneficial therapies more easily  accessible to patients.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Through binding to folate receptor-β (FR-β), the new (99m)Tc-EC20  (Etarfolatide) imaging technique detects activated but not resting macrophages  in vivo. The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored  blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain  severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Advances in our understanding of the biology of paediatric central nervous  system (CNS) tumours have encouraged pathologists to use molecular markers  alongside histopathological analysis for disease classification or prognostication and treatment stratification. In this article, we review  molecular genetic alterations in paediatric CNS tumours, including those in  low-grade and high-grade gliomas, ependymomas, and embryonal tumours. Some of these molecular changes with clinicopathological utility have been used for the  first time in the most recent edition of the World Health Organization (WHO)  classification of CNS tumours to define entities like ependymoma, RELA  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease, specifically for motor function loss in pediatric patients ≥3 years of age."," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been tested for the construction of several organs, including bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves, skin, heart tissue, and tracheal splints. Additionally, it has been used to create complex constructs such as zig"," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is  driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing,  art, education and medicine. Recent advances have enabled 3D printing of  biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures. Other applications include developing  ,  Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context:  The capability to print three-dimensional (3D) cellular tubes is not only a  logical first step towards successful organ printing but also a critical  indicator of the feasibility of the envisioned organ printing technology. A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with  an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular  tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even  after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates. Using  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: METHODS: Metformin (1,500-2,250 mg/day) was preoperatively administered to  patients with endometrial cancer for 4 to 6 weeks. Expression of the PP2A  regulatory subunits, 4 (PPP2R4) and B (PP2A-B), was evaluated using real-time  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using paired  specimens obtained before and after metformin treatment. The effect of PPP2R4  inhibition with small interfering RNA was evaluated in the endometrial cancer  cell lines HEC265 and HEC1B. P values of < .05 were considered statistically  significant. RESULTS: Preoperative metformin treatment significantly reduced the expression  of PP2A-B, as determined using IHC, and the mRNA expression of PPP2R4, as determined using RT-PCR, in the patients with endometrial cancer. However,  metformin could not directly alter the PPP2R4 mRNA levels in the endometrial  cancer cell lines in vitro. PPP2R4 knockdown reduced the proliferation and induced the apoptosis by activating caspases 3/7 in HEC265 and HEC1B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of the PP2A-B subunit, including PPP2R4, is an  important indirect target of metformin. Inhibition of PP2A may be an option for  ,  Context: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 is the predominant genotype in South Africa.  However, to date, only 2 full-length genotype 5 genomes have been sequenced and  only one is from South Africa. This study characterized HCV genotype 5 sequences  from South Africa, including six near full-length genomes, as well as the E1  region from an additional 12 genotype 5 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these  near full-length genome sequences revealed that all genotype 5 sequences formed  a close cluster with high bootstrap support. Bayesian analysis of the E1 region  was used to estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA). The  tMRCA for HCV genotype 5a was estimated at 114-134 years before the last sampling date. In conclusion, this study provides six near full-length genotype  5 nucleotide sequences for use as references to design efficient vaccines and  for the development of new antiviral agents, and provides further insight into the diversity of HCV genotypes circulating in South Africa.  ,  Context: The H209/V6 cell line was derived from the H209 small cell lung cancer cell line  by selection in etoposide (VP-16). Cytogenetic analysis indicates that the  sensitive and resistant cell lines share 20 marker chromosomes and thus are  clearly related. However, the H209/V6 cell line has four additional structurally  altered chromosomes and a 2 N-modal chromosome number, while the H209 cell line  is hypotetraploid (4 N-). H209/V6 cells are cross-resistant to some drugs that interact with topoisomerase II but not mitoxantrone. H209/V6 cells are also not  cross-resistant to vincristine, trimetrexate, or cisplatin. The rates of VP-16  efflux are the same in the resistant and sensitive cell lines, which is consistent with the observation that P-glycoprotein mRNA is not detectable in  either cell line.

CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N.

Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane.

Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a  novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in  patients with CD.  METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified.

In this study we provide the first survey evidence for clinical use  of iv GSH with iv AA. To address questions of efficacy and drug-drug  interaction, we tested 10 cancer cell lines with AA, GSH, and their combination. The results showed that pharmacologic AA induced cytotoxicity in all tested  cancer cells, with IC(50) less than 4 mM, a concentration easily achievable in  humans. GSH reduced cytotoxicity by 10-95% by attenuating AA-induced H(2)O(2) production.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, prostate cancer, and symptoms associated with these conditions."," Context:  BACKGROUND: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen  deprivation therapy (ADT) is an established treatment option to prolong survival  for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated  in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH  antagonist. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in  103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and  neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.  ,  Context:  The orally active nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor  antagonist relugolix (Relumina) is being developed by Takeda and ASKA  Pharmaceutical as a treatment for various sex hormone related disorders. Relugolix was recently approved for marketing in Japan as a treatment for  symptoms associated with uterine fibroids, and studies evaluating the efficacy  of the drug as treatment for endometriosis-associated pain and prostate cancer are currently underway. This article summarizes the milestones in the  development of relugolix leading to this first approval for the treatment of  symptoms associated with uterine fibroids.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (e.g.,  leuprolide) are the standard agents for achieving androgen deprivation for  prostate cancer despite the initial testosterone surge and delay in therapeutic  effect. The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing  hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15.

Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors.

Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of  developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages?

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate the performance of string set matching problems in computational proteomics. The Aho-Corasick algorithm was adapted for execution in FPGA devices, optimizing space and performance. Additionally, a reconfigurable systolic architecture"," Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: significant cost/performance gains over general-purpose machines. We describe  one such computer here: a custom accelerator for gene sequence analysis. The  accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for  nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by  available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation  can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to  a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz. The  boards are completely functional, and yield a 15-fold performance improvement  over an unassisted host.  ,  Context: studies is rather low suggest that aligning (parts of) those reads with a single  gap is in fact desirable. RESULTS: In this article, we present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise  short-read alignments.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the  functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the  computations by a factor of 20 compared to other programmes. The analogous SSE- and GPU-based implementations accelerate the computations by a factor of 6 and  11, respectively, compared to the CPU version. The library also provides the  user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a  variable, but bounded, number of gaps in the alignment. CONCLUSIONS: We present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise short-read  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context:  Genomic sequence alignment is an important technique to decode genome sequences  in bioinformatics. Next-Generation Sequencing technologies produce genomic data  of longer reads. Cloud platforms are adopted to address the problems arising from storage and analysis of large genomic data.

The efficient and economical  strategy in this program can be employed to study molecular sequences for gene cloning, mutation analysis, and identical sequence search projects.  ,  Context: Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is continuously being damaged by endogenous  processes such as metabolism or by exogenous events such as radiation. The  specific phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine residue 139, described as  γ-H2AX, is an excellent indicator or marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).  The yield of γ-H2AX (foci) is shown to have some correlation with the dose of  radiation or other DSB-causing agents. However, there is some discrepancy in the  DNA DSB foci yield among imaging and other methods such as gel electrophoresis.  Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential  tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to  image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of γ-H2AX foci formation  after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured  illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and  HyVolution 2. We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques  ,  Context: Since the introduction of next-generation sequencing, several techniques have  been developed to selectively enrich and sequence specific parts of the genome  at high coverage. These techniques include enzymatic methods employing molecular  inversion probes, PCR based approaches, hybrid capture, and in-solution capture.  In-solution capture employs RNA probes transcribed from a pool of DNA template  oligos designed to match regions of interest to specifically bind and enrich  genomic DNA fragments. This method is highly efficient, especially if genomic  target regions are large in size or quantity. Diverse in-solution capture kits  are available, but are costly when large sample numbers need to be analyzed. Here we present a cost-effective strategy for the design of custom DNA  libraries, their transcription into RNA libraries, and application for  in-solution capture. We show the efficacy by comparing the method to a commercial kit and further demonstrate that emulsion PCR can be used for bias  free amplification and virtual immortalization of DNA template libraries.  ,  Context: TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.

Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding.  Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the  dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic  metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good  interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral  factor Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible  and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process.

Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the  CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  ,  Context: Patients with cardiovascular diseases are often treated by concurrent multiple  drug therapy. It is therefore plausible that with an increasing number of drugs  the risk of drug interactions increases. Such interactions can be either  pharmacodynamic (and are due to the mechanism of the administered drugs) or they  can be pharmacokinetic (resulting in a reduction or enhancement of drug  elimination). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be either due to interactions at  the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (most important cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzymes) or interactions at the level of drug transporter proteins (for example  P-glycoprotein (MDR1)). It is important to distinguish between both mechanisms because interactions at transporter proteins can be attributed to those drugs  that are not enzymatically metabolized. The scope of this article is to give an  overview on clinically relevant interactions of the four beta-blockers widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases namely atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7),  bisoprolol (CAS 66722-44-9), metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) (each beta-1  selective), and carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3) (beta-1 and beta-2 nonselective).

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR associates with its own mRNA, enhancing its translation and cytoplasmic levels. It also interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of its own mRNA, increasing the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped  mRNAs. In the absence of ELAVL1, skipping of exon 11 of Eif4enif1 forms the  stable, short isoform, 4E-Ts. This alternative splicing event results in the  formation of RNA processing bodies (PBs), enhanced turnover of angiogenic mRNAs,  and suppressed sprouting behavior of vascular endothelial cells. Further,  endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization  after hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis in oncogene-induced mammary  cancer, resulting in attenuated blood flow and tumor growth, respectively.  ELAVL1-regulated alternative splicing of Eif4enif1 leading to enhanced formation of PB and mRNA turnover constitutes a novel posttranscriptional mechanism  critical for pathological angiogenesis.  ,  Context: down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the  hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) or ELAVL1 is  implicated in a variety of biological processes as well as being linked with a  number of diseases, including cancer. Despite a great deal of prior investigation into HuR, there is still much to learn about its function. We take  an important step in this direction by conducting cross-linking and  immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing experiments followed by an extensive computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site  and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly  uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic  overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  ","19884656, 25422430, 9763509, 23223443, 21890634, 20007147","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of an organism, specifically in budding yeast."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome.  Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an  important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently,  there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture  of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem  cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data  with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a  determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a ""ground state"" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying  DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous  chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone  ,  Context: A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ","21551148, 21206756, 22435808, 26305225, 11724736, 20232936",G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy.,"22435808, 21206756, 17038564, 19620965, 30113318, 20232936, 26305225, 21551148"
Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no indication of desmin presence in plants. In fact, one of the contexts mentions that desmin is a muscle-specific protein found in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, with no mention of plant cells. Additionally, another context"," Context: and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin  vitro. In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in  diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm  filaments and protofilarnents. The periodic repeat is one of the fundamental  characteristic of all intermediate filaments, and demonstrates the half  staggered arrangement of keratin molecules within the filaments.  ,  Context:  Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the  intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an  early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate  filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in  the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific  fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest  impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. To determine whether altered  capillary function or an intrinsic cardiomyocyte defect is responsible for  desmin null DCM, transgenic mice were generated to rescue desmin expression  specifically to cardiomyocytes. Desmin rescue mice display a wild-type cardiac phenotype with no fibrosis or calcification in the myocardium and normalization  of coronary flow. Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is also restored to normal.  Markers of hypertrophy upregulated in desmin null hearts return to wild-type levels in desmin rescue mice. Working hearts were perfused to assess coronary  flow and cardiac power.

The second patient had a  cardioskeletal myopathy, similar to his mother who had died more than 20 years  previously. Because of the dominant family history, a laminopathy was suspected  and a mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene was identified. This mutation,  however, was not present in his mother, but instead, surprisingly, was  identified in his virtually asymptomatic father. Unusual accumulations of desmin  found in the cardiac muscle of the propositus prompted us to examine the desmin  gene in this patient, and in so doing, we identified a desmin mutation, in addition to the LMNA mutation in the propositus. These cases suggest that  separate mutations in related proteins that are believed to interact, or that  represent different parts of a presumed functional pathway, may synergistically contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context:  Mammalian long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are best known for  modulating transcription. Here we report a posttranscriptional function for  lincRNA-p21 as a modulator of translation. Association of the RNA-binding protein HuR with lincRNA-p21 favored the recruitment of let-7/Ago2 to  lincRNA-p21, leading to lower lincRNA-p21 stability. Under reduced HuR levels,  lincRNA-p21 accumulated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, increasing its association with JUNB and CTNNB1 mRNAs and selectively lowering their  translation. With elevated HuR, lincRNA-p21 levels declined, which in turn  derepressed JunB and β-catenin translation and increased the levels of these  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: transcription in cis. By investigating the epigenetic regulation of lincRNAs, we  observed both positive and negative correlations between DNA methylation and  gene expression (expression quantitative trait methylation [eQTMs]), as  expected, and found that the landscapes of passive and active roles of DNA  methylation in gene regulation are similar to protein-coding genes. However,  lincRNA eQTMs are located closer to TSSs than are protein-coding gene eQTMs.  These similarities and differences in genetic and epigenetic regulation between  lincRNAs and protein-coding genes contribute to the elucidation of potential  functions of lincRNAs.  ,  Context: lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in  male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified  whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between  D. melanogaster and mouse. This study predicts that the genomes of not only  vertebrates, such as mammals, but also an invertebrate (fruit fly) harbor large  numbers of lincRNA loci. Our findings now permit exploitation of Drosophila  genetics for the investigation of lincRNA mechanisms, including lincRNAs with  potential functional analogues in mammals.  ,  Context: Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) represent a large portion of the  noncoding genes in mammals and other eukaryotes but remains among the least  well-understood of genetic factors to date. Here, we systematically analyzed the  human SNPs of lincRNAs at a genome level. We found a significantly lower SNP  density in lincRNA regions than both their upstream and downstream flanking  regions. Functional regions show lower SNP density than other regions in  lincRNAs. We revealed that lincRNAs with higher expression levels and broader  expression spectrum have significantly lower SNP density. Moreover, we  identified lincRNAs that are under recent positive selection and revealed that these lincRNAs show distinct SNP density, expression level, and tissue  specificity. Importantly, we identified a genetic variant (rs7990916:T>C) under  recent positive selection at a brain-specific lincRNA that significantly affects the structure of normal brain.

The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.

RAPIDR has been extensively tested with a large sample set as part  of the RAPID project in the UK. The package contains quality control steps to  make it robust for use in the clinical setting.  AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: RAPIDR is implemented in R and can be freely  downloaded via CRAN from here:  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RAPIDR/index.html. CONTACT: kitty.lo@ucl.ac.uk SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the  intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an  early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of  desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  ,  Context: reads sequenced, so it is important and challenging to determine the optimal  read depth for an experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an  existing experiment. RESULTS: By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing experiment and  determining where the saturation of power and accuracy occurs, one can determine  what the most useful depth should be for future experiments, and furthermore,  confirm whether an existing experiment had sufficient depth to justify its  conclusions. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient  approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at  each depth. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The subSeq R package is available at http://github.com/StoreyLab/subSeq/.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose suspension vaccine.," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: DATA SYNTHESIS: Approval of Vaxchora, was based on efficacy of the vaccine in  human trials demonstrating 90.3% protection among those challenged with V  cholerae 10 days after vaccination and in immunogenicity studies with 90%  systemic vibriocidal antibody conversion at 6 months after a single-dose of  vaccine. Tolerability was acceptable, with the most common adverse effects  reported to be fatigue, headache, and abdominal pain.  CONCLUSION: Vaxchora is the only FDA-approved, single-dose oral vaccine for the  prevention of cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1 in adult travelers from  the United States going to cholera-affected areas. Safety and efficacy has not been established in children, immunocompromised persons, and pregnant or  breastfeeding women or those living in cholera-endemic areas.  ,  Context:  Treprostinil is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue with antiplatelet and  vasodilatory properties. It is the only prostacyclin analogue with different  options of delivery, i.e. subcutaneous, intravenous, inhaled or oral. Subcutaneous treprostinil has been shown in short- and long-term studies to  improve exercise capacity, functional class, haemodynamics and survival in  patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pain at the infusion site has been a major drawback of subcutaneous treprostinil, hampering dose  titration, and ultimately leading to increased discontinuation rates. The  additional clinical interest in treprostinil as an alternative intravenous  ,  Context: The half-life is around 8 to 12 hours, with a peak activity 2 to 4 hours after  ingestion. Dabigatran is mainly eliminated via the kidney, hence requiring  dose-adjustment in case of moderate renal insufficiency, and contra-indicated in  case of severe renal insufficiency. Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and  liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are  available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few  interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short  half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote  in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase  their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an  approval has been granted by health authorities.  ,  Context: infection, and illness may progress rapidly. CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old primigravida at 9 weeks' gestation was presented to  our institution because of the sudden onset of sore throat, fever, chills, and  vomiting for 5 days. She was diagnosed with early pregnancy H1N1 infection,  vulvar herpes infection, and impending intravascular disseminated coagulopathy.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg and valacyclovir 500 mg were then administered  orally twice daily for 5 days. The patient's fever, chills, and vomiting  subsided 2 days later. The real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasal discharge for influenza virus types A and B showed positive results for the A/H1N1 influenza virus. The early pregnancy was  terminated by therapeutic curettage at the patient's request. The surgical  specimen revealed products of conception with the presence of necrotic chorionic villi, and focal lymphocytes in decidual tissue. RT-PCR analysis of gestational  tissue for A/H1N1 was negative. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral  therapy.  ,  Context: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of volanesorsen on the corrected  QT (QTc) interval. This thorough QT study enrolled 52 healthy male and female  subjects who were randomized at a single site in a four-way crossover study.  Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 treatment sequences and crossed over  into four treatment periods over the course of which each subject was to receive  a single therapeutic dose of volanesorsen as a 300 mg subcutaneous (SC)  injection, a single supratherapeutic dose of volanesorsen as 300 mg intravenous  (IV) infusion, a single oral (PO) dose of moxifloxacin (positive control), and  placebo dose. The study demonstrated that volanesorsen 300 mg SC and 300 mg IV did not have a clinically relevant effect on ΔΔQTcF exceeding 10 ms. The largest  mean effect at any postdose time point was 3.0 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]:  0.8-5.2) after SC dosing and 1.8 ms (90% CI -0.4 to 4.0) after IV dosing. Volanesorsen, at the studied therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, does not  have a clinically meaningful effect on the QTc.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold  increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class  switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B  lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation  endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This  finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune  disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.  ,  Context: TLR7 and 8, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were  tested for association. RESULTS: In both samples, significant associations were observed for single SNPs  and haplotypes of both TLR7 and 8 in all four phenotypes investigated: asthma,  rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and increased specific IgE. The most significant  association was seen for rs2407992 (TLR8) in asthma (p = 0.00023, sample A and B  combined, recessive model). In TLR7, rs179008 showed the strongest association.  Both rs179008 and rs2407992 are of putative functional significance, potentially  affecting TLR7 processing and TLR8 splicing, respectively. Haplotypes comprising the major alleles of these two SNPs were overtransmitted to the affected  offspring (eg, p = 0.00012 in asthma, combined sample, additive model). CONCLUSION: The results provide strong evidence that TLR7 and 8 may confer susceptibility to asthma and related atopic disorders and highlight these  receptors as interesting targets for individualised, causally directed  treatment.  ,  Context: The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly  autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines  and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were  inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on yaa-enhanced TLR7 signaling in vitro, and these data place Sles1 downstream from  the lesion in innate immune responses mediated by TLR7, suggesting that Sles1  modulates the activation of adaptive immunity in response to innate immune  signaling.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit proteins and NELL1/2. Specifically, NELL1 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2.  ,  Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM  ,  Context: acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome  side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to  suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or  antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of  MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs,  (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that  specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands  generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably  separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP  antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce  analgesia with reduced tolerance. The type of response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone and naltrindole as  above) and the space between them. Production and evaluation of bivalent ligands  is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are  ,  Context: We investigated a series of uracil analogues by introducing various substituents  on the phenyl ring of the N-3 aminoethyl side chain and evaluated their  antagonistic activity against human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  receptors. Analogues with substituents at the ortho or meta position  demonstrated potent in vitro antagonistic activity. Specifically, the  introduction of a 2-OMe group enhanced nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) inhibition up to 6-fold compared to the unsubstituted analogue. We  identified compound 12c as a highly potent GnRH antagonist with moderate CYP  inhibition. Compound 12c showed potent and prolonged LH suppression after a single dose was orally administered in castrated monkeys compared to a known  antagonist, Elagolix. We believe that our SAR study offers useful insights to  design GnRH antagonists as a potential treatment option for endometriosis.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so  accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment. Median time to progression was 5.7 months  for thymoma patients and 3.6 months for thymic carcinoma patients. Saracatinib  was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Src inhibition by saracatinib did not produce any radiographic  responses, though some patients did experience stable disease. Though negative, this study shows the feasibility of completing a trial in this rare disease, and  of accruing reasonably significant numbers of thymic carcinoma patients. More  clinical trials are required for this population (NCT00718809).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Src has a critical role in tumor cell migration and invasion.  Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase  inhibitor. METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had received one prior  treatment and had measurable disease were enrolled in this phase 2 study. Saracatinib was administered at 175 mg by mouth daily for 28 day cycles until  dose-limiting toxicity or progression as determined by staging every 2 cycles.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone blocks the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), significantly reducing androgen production."," Context: hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed.

Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend  survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate  cancer. Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is  currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our  previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance  exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that  enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have  determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown  of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: both of which are regulated by TGF-β, are critical steps in mediating cancer  progression. Here, we sought to identify novel direct targets of TGF-β signaling  in lung cancer cells and have indentified the zyxin gene as a target of  Smad3-mediated TGF-β1 signaling. Zyxin concentrates at focal adhesions and along  the actin cytoskeleton; as such, we hypothesized that cytoskeletal organization,  motility, and EMT in response to TGF-β1 might be regulated by zyxin expression.  We show that TGF-β1 treatment of lung cancer cells caused rapid  phospho-Smad3-dependent expression of zyxin. Zyxin expression was critical for  the formation and integrity of cell adherens junctions. Silencing of zyxin decreased expression of the focal adhesion protein vasodilator-activated  phospho-protein (VASP), although the formation and morphology of focal adhesions  remained unchanged. Zyxin-depleted cells displayed significantly increased integrin α5β1 levels, accompanied by enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and  acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in response to TGF-β1. Zyxin silencing  led to elevated integrin α5β1-dependent single cell motility. Importantly, these  ,  Context:  Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly 311C90) is a novel, oral, acute treatment for  migraine.

On average, 75% of its eventual Cmax is achieved within  1 h of dosing. Plasma concentrations are sustained for 4 to 6 h after dosing  with single or multiple peaks in the plasma concentration-time profile, reflecting continued absorption down the gastrointestinal tract. The  pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan indicate dose proportionality over the dose  range of 2.5 to 50 mg and there are no significant changes on multiple dosing.

The anatomical changes that occur in the lateral  geniculate nucleus and visual cortex following monocular visual deprivation  affect both eyes and follow very different patterns with deprivation that begins  at different ages and differ markedly in the magnocellular and parvocellular  pathways. The interactions between the eyes and the requirements for recovery  are very different following onset at different ages and differ for  magnocellular and parvocellular pathways. Electrophysiological and  psychophysical studies in man show different patterns of change in patients with  strabismic amblyopia of early and late onset and abnormalities of color and motion processing that affect both amblyopic and fellow eyes and differ with age  of onset. Abnormal visual experience also has more general effects on  development, with amblyopic children showing abnormalities of eye-hand coordination when using either their amblyopic or fellow eyes, and abnormalities  of reading. Differential effects of abnormal visual experience and treatment on  magnocellular and parvocellular pathways may account for some of the visual  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: following terms: hemochromatosis, hereditary, hyperpigmentation,  hypopigmentation, keratosis, melanin, seborrheic, siderosis. Despite the  generalized hyperpigmentation that is usually observed in hereditary  hemochromatosis, seborrheic keratosis may present rarely as hypopigmented  lesions in individuals affected by this disease. Therefore, seborrheic keratoses  should be considered in the differential diagnosis in hemochromatosis patients  who present with uncharacteristic pigmentation.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To describe the features of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis  (cesioflammea type).

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"No, there is no indication of thyronamines having an effect on fat tissue. The provided information only discusses their ability to reduce mitochondrial O2 consumption and increase H2O2 release in rat liver mitochondria, with no mention of fat tissue."," Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate  and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid  ,  Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Requirements of thyroxine increase in all conditions characterized by impaired  gastric acid secretion. Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of  drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption. In addition, a series of diseases  including celiac disease and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, as well  as nutritional habits may be important in patient control. Finally, we mention  the effects of a growing list of drugs and thyroid disruptors that may also  affect thyroid hormone metabolism at many levels.  ,  Context: There are two types of adipose tissue in the body whose function appears to be  clearly differentiated. White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat,  whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to  produce heat. A good balance between them is important to maintain energy  homeostasis. The concept of white adipose tissue has radically changed in the  past decades, and is now considered as an endocrine organ that secretes many  factors with autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine functions. In addition, we can  no longer consider white adipose tissue as a single tissue, because it shows  different metabolic profiles in its different locations, with also different implications. Although the characteristic cell of adipose tissue is the  adipocyte, this is not the only cell type present in adipose tissue, neither the  most abundant. Other cell types in adipose tissue described include stem cells, preadipocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The  balance between these different cell types and their expression profile is  closely related to maintenance of energy homeostasis. Increases in adipocyte  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is a deaminated analogue of  L-thyroxine that blocks the actions of L-thyroxine and  3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine at the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone on  integrin alpha v beta 3. Tetrac blocks the proliferative effects of thyroid  hormone on tumor cells and the proangiogenesis actions of the hormone. In the  absence of thyroid hormone, tetrac also blocks angiogenesis induced by various growth factors. Covalently linked to poly(lactide-co-glycolide), tetrac  nanoparticles (tetrac NP) do not gain access to the cell interior and act  exclusively at the integrin receptor. Here, the activity of tetrac and tetrac NP against follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC)-236 cells was studied in two models:  (1) tumor cell implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system and  (2) xenografts in the nude mouse.  ,  Context: hormone and TSH was intact in one and disrupted in the other. One model,  thyroidectomized (THYx) mice, had a 100-fold increase in TSH and a normal TSH  receptor (TSHR); in contrast, the other model, hyt/hyt mice, had a 120-fold  elevation of TSH but a nonfunctional TSHR. Although both THYx and hyt/hyt mice  were in a severe hypothyroid state, the epididymal fat (mg)/body wt (g) (F/B)  ratio of THYx mice was much smaller than that of hyt/hyt mice (8.2 ± 0.43 vs.  14.4 ± 0.40, respectively, P < 0.001). The fat cell diameter in THYx mice was  also smaller than that in hyt/hyt mice (79 ± 2.8 vs. 105 ± 2.2 μm, respectively,  P < 0.001), suggesting that TSH induced lipolysis in adipose tissues. When we transferred a functional mouse TSHR gene and a control plasmid into opposite  sides of epididymal fat of hyt/hyt mice by plasmid injection combined with  electroporation, fat weight of the TSHR side was decreased to 60% of that of the control side. Messenger RNA levels of hormone-sensitive lipase in epididymal fat  containing the transferred TSHR gene were twofold higher than those in tissue  from the control side. These results indicated that TSH worked as a lipolytic  ","12869545, 21664427, 20694403, 23834768, 20187783, 22496347",thyronamines cause reduction of fat mass,20880963
Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: acetylation by nicotinamide suggests the additional involvement of sirtuin  deacetylases in S6K deacetylation. Both expression of p300 and HDAC inhibition  cause increases in S6K protein levels, and we have shown that S6K2 is stabilized  in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors. The finding that S6Ks are targeted by  histone acetyltransferases uncovers a novel mode of crosstalk between mitogenic  signalling pathways and the transcriptional machinery and reveals additional  complexity in the regulation of S6K function.  ,  Context: Star-PAP is a nuclear non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (PAP) that shows  specificity toward mRNA targets. Star-PAP activity is stimulated by lipid  messenger phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphoshate (PI4,5P2) and is regulated by  the associated Type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that synthesizes  PI4,5P2 as well as protein kinases. These associated kinases act as coactivators  of Star-PAP that regulates its activity and specificity toward mRNAs, yet the  mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a  phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the  domain required for PIPKIα interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by CKIα within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and  interaction with PIPKIα. Unlike the CKIα mediated phosphorylation at the  catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKIα activity. S6 phosphorylation  together with coactivator PIPKIα controlled select subset of Star-PAP target  messages by regulating Star-PAP-mRNA association. Our results establish a novel  ,  Context: is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  often activated in human diseases, such as cancer, mTOR signaling pathways are  deactivated in ischemic diseases. From Drosophila to humans, mTOR is necessary  for Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, and the regulation of Akt-mTOR signaling  pathways may have a potential role in ischemic disease. This review evaluates  the potential functions of mTOR in ischemic diseases. A novel mTOR-interacting  protein deregulates over-expression in ischemic disease, representing a new mechanism for controlling mTOR signaling pathways and potential therapeutic  strategies for ischemic diseases.  ,  Context: oxidation, and to induce steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol  feeding led to activation of SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and  independent mechanisms. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1  disrupted DEPTOR function, enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic  fatty liver, inflammation, and liver injury in mice. CONCLUSION: The dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1 signaling is a critical  determinant of ALD pathology; targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR and selectively  inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential for treating ALD  in humans. (Hepatology 2018).  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, Sin1, mLST8, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: rictor. Hence it is mTORC2 inhibition that causes mSREBP1 reduction. As a  result, expression of the mSREBP1 target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and  fatty-acid synthase was suppressed, along with suppressed lipogenesis in cells  exposed to INK128. Moreover, mSREBP1 stability was reduced in cells treated with  INK128 or rictor knockdown. Inhibition of proteasome, GSK3 or the E3 ubiquitin  ligase, FBXW7, prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by mTORC2 inhibition. Thus  mTORC2 inhibition clearly facilitates GSK3-dependent, FBXW7-mediated mSREBP1  degradation, leading to mSREBP1 reduction. Accordingly, we conclude that mTORC2  positively regulates mSREBP1 stability and lipogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel biological function of mTORC2 in the regulation of lipogenesis and warrant  further study in this direction.  ,  Context:  The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in  cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8  (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of  mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2.

TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  ","21871173, 17461779, 24331524, 25893295, 21413931, 23049074","Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a kinase complex comprised of mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, mLST8/GβL and PRR5.","24077282, 24244675, 22678916, 23049074, 22595285, 22773877, 23673367, 23455608, 22532249, 22820188"
What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"There is no national screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK, but opportunistic screening is common.

Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up.

Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study  investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values.  RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents) are--3.5 ng/ml for 50 - 59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60 - 69 year olds and 6.5  ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58%, 200/346) of respondents were aware  of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20% (n = 69/346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68%, n = 234/346) used higher PSA cut-offs than  recommended by the DoH. The level of compliance showed marked regional variation  with a range from 7% to 44% (median 19%). In addition, it was apparent that  ,  Context: The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)  demonstrated a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality. The  ongoing Comparison Arm for ProtecT (CAP) cluster randomised controlled trial  (RCT) evaluates prostate cancer screening effectiveness by comparing primary  care centres allocated to a round of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing  (intervention) or standard clinical care. Over 550 centres (around 450,000 men)  were randomised in eight United Kingdom areas (2002-2008). Intervention group  participants were also eligible for the ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and  Treatment) RCT evaluating active monitoring, radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy treatments for localised prostate cancer. In ProtecT, over 1500 of  around 3000 men with prostate cancer were randomised from over 10,000 with an  elevated PSA in around 111,000 attendees at clinics.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, and may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and  deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive  span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking,  radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a  role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain  drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the  development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland. Further research is  warranted into the importance of fetal microchimerism and of viral infections  capable of mounting an endogenous interferon-alpha response.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Yes, ospemifene is effective for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The results of a multicenter phase 3 study showed that ospemifene was statistically significantly superior to"," Context: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel  selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal  atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and  physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo. A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years  who self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis  of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of ospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy  of ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells,  vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of  parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of  ,  Context:  Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene, bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  ,  Context: moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective  estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term  studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal  women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing  symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the  effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient  preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not  available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide  sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus  and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However,  endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There  ,  Context: Ospemifene (Osphena™) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),  with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The drug is approved  in the USA, and application for EU regulatory approval is underway. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first  approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  ,  Context: were having 5% or less superficial cells on the vaginal smear (maturation  index), vaginal pH greater than 5.0, and at least one moderate or severe symptom  of vulvovaginal atrophy. The four coprimary endpoints were the change from  baseline to 12 weeks in the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells on the  vaginal smear, change in vaginal pH, and change in severity of most bothersome  symptom (vaginal dryness or dyspareunia) compared with placebo. All participants  were given a nonhormonal vaginal lubricant for use as needed. RESULTS: Ospemifene was statistically significantly superior to placebo in each  of the coprimary endpoints at the 60-mg dose. Statistically significant results were achieved for all coprimary endpoints with the 30-mg dose except for  dyspareunia. Ospemifene was well tolerated at both doses and demonstrated a  favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with  vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants.  ,  Context: [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI =  7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P  = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001)  indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in Caenorhabditis elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons. We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the  plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: RNA editing increases transcriptome diversity through post-transcriptional  modifications of RNA. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the  adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in  higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but  their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans  at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a new computational pipeline with a ""bisulfite-seq-mapping-like"" step and achieved  a threefold increase in identification sensitivity. A total of 99.5% of the  47,660 A-to-I editing sites were found in clusters. Of the 3080 editing clusters, 65.7% overlapped with DNA transposons in noncoding regions and 73.7%  could form hairpin structures. The numbers of editing sites and clusters were  highest at the L1 and embryonic stages. The editing frequency of a cluster  ,  Context: knockdown-induced reproduction defects, C. elegans was challenged with a  short-term hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The early phase egg production of both mock  and G6PD-knockdown C. elegans were significantly affected by H2O2. However,  H2O2-induced germ cell apoptosis was more dramatic in mock than that in  G6PD-deficient C. elegans. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in  defective oogenesis and embryogenesis caused by G6PD knockdown, mutants of p53  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the  upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and  hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased  egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of  sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3- and 9.6-fold increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these  findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C.  elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and  ","32868918, 16752214, 11997343, 12949121, 25373143, 23640458",In C. elegans epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes.,32868918
Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular Ca2+ overload is implicated in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as suggested by studies showing impaired [Ca(2+)]i homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATP"," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated  ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR  ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased  in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR  Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with  insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view  that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may  result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with  depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction. Accordingly, the effects of verapamil, a Ca2+  antagonist, on cardiac function, ultrastructure, and high-energy phosphate  stores in the myocardium were evaluated in rats made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozocin (65 mg/kg).

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context: Gleevec (imatinib mesylate), a highly promising new drug for the treatment of  chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, in accelerated phase, and in  chronic phase after interferon failure or intolerance, received orphan drug  status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan  Products Development on January 31, 2001, and accelerated approval from the FDA  for the above three indications on May 10, 2001. The purpose of this report is to summarize FDA regulatory mechanisms, i.e., accelerated approval and orphan  drug regulations, that have permitted patients to receive this drug as rapidly  as possible.  ,  Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor  monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is  discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments.  Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: 100 mg golimumab) and 4 developed active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab (50 mg or 100 mg) maintained clinical response through  week 54 in patients who responded to induction therapy with golimumab and had  moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis; patients who received 100 mg  golimumab had clinical remission and mucosal healing at weeks 30 and 54. Safety  was consistent with that reported for other TNFα antagonists and golimumab in  other approved indications. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00488631.  ,  Context: patients with MS by flow cytometry, to determine the frequencies and activation  states of naive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts. RESULTS: The frequencies of each B-cell population in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (PBMC) were greatly reduced 2 weeks after starting fingolimod  treatment. Detailed analysis revealed a significant reduction in activated  memory B cells (CD38(int-high)), particularly those expressing Ki-67, a marker  of cell proliferation. Also, we noted an increased proportion of activated  plasmablasts (CD138(+)) among whole plasmablasts, in the patients treated with  fingolimod. CONCLUSIONS: The marked reduction of Ki-67(+) memory B cells may be directly linked with the effectiveness of fingolimod in treating MS. In contrast, the  relative resistance of CD138(+) plasmablasts to fingolimod may be of relevance  for understanding the differential effectiveness of fingolimod in individual  patients.  ,  Context: slightly modified, or defined post hoc, by demographic factors (including sex  and age), disease characteristics (including baseline disability scores, relapse  rates, and lesion parameters), and response to previous therapy (including  analyses in patients eligible for fingolimod treatment according to the European  label). Data were analysed by intention to treat. The FREEDOMS study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00289978.  FINDINGS: Treatment with fingolimod 0·5 mg was associated with significantly  lower ARRs versus placebo across all subgroups except for patients aged over 40  years.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development by governing gene regulation and genome organization, which are mutually dependent effectors of cell identity. It regulates various steps of transcription initiation and connects enhancers to promoters, with high Mediator"," Context: and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers,  including breast and prostate cancer. In addition to its role in genomic  signaling, MED12 has been implicated in non-genomic signaling by interacting  with and activating TGF-beta receptor 2 in the cytoplasm. Recent structural  studies have revealed extensive inter-domain interactions and complex  architecture of the Mediator-Pol II complex, suggesting that Mediator is capable  of reorganizing its conformation and composition to fit cellular needs. We  propose that alterations in Mediator subunit expression that occur in various  cancers could impact the organization and function of Mediator, resulting in changes in gene expression that promote malignancy. A better understanding of  the role of Mediator in cancer could reveal new approaches to the diagnosis and  treatment of Mediator-dependent endocrine cancers, especially in settings of therapy resistance.  ,  Context: Structures bearing a resemblance to nucleosomes can be assembled by incubating  calf thymus High Mobility Group proteins (1 + 2) with closed circular DNA. These  HMG proteins are capable of forming beads and inducing superhelicity when bound  to DNA. However, they do not protect from nuclease digestion the discrete DNA  fragments characteristic of nucleosomes. The relationship between HMGs (1 + 2)  and the ""primitive"" histone-like DNA-packaging proteins from prokaryotes and  mitochondria is discussed.  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: Post-translational modifications of histone proteins, the basic building blocks  around which eukaryotic DNA is organized, are crucially involved in the  regulation of genome activity as they control chromatin structure and dynamics.  The recruitment of specific binding proteins that recognize and interact with  particular histone modifications is thought to constitute a fundamental  mechanism by which histone marks mediate biological function. For instance, tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is important for recruiting  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby  regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging, and heterochromatin formation. Until now, little was known about the regulation of effector-histone mark  interactions, and in particular, of the binding of HP1 to H3K9me3. Recently, we  and others presented evidence that a ""binary methylation-phosphorylation switch""  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation.

Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria the successful management of  impetigo in the future is an area of concern. COMMENT: Current treatment options that favour the use of oral antibiotic  therapy are increasingly problematic. Widespread use of these agents contributes  to antimicrobial resistance and has adverse consequences for individuals and  communities. There is a need for new topical antimicrobials and antiseptics as  an alternative treatment strategy. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: To successfully treat impetigo into the future and  ensure that therapy does not contribute to bacterial resistance, additional research is required to ascertain the usefulness of alternative agents,  including new topical antimicrobials and antiseptics.  ,  Context: norfloxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, ciprofloxacin), 15 beta-lactam or  cephalosporin antibiotics (cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam,  cefdinir, cefoperazone, cefpiramide, cefamandole, cefixime, ceftibuten,  cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: vaccination of cattle with a previously tested recombinant chimera consisting of  Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit and the HC of BoNTs C and D.  Vaccinated animals produced neutralizing antibodies against serotypes C and D  averaging 5±0 and 6.14±1.06IU/mL, respectively. For BoNT D, the titers were  greater than those measured for the commercial vaccine, which induced titers of  5±0 and 2.85±1.35 against the respective serotypes, suggesting that this chimera  is effective against cattle botulism.  ,  Context: Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for first and recurrent ischaemic  stroke, and anticoagulation, mainly by use of coumarin medications, is an  effective strategy for reducing ischaemic stroke occurrence in these patients.  However, the coumarin medications have disadvantages. Over the past decade,  important strides have been made towards developing improved anticoagulant  medications. This review discusses these new developments and what they mean for the future of primary and secondary ischaemic stroke prevention in patients with  atrial fibrillation. Relevant papers were identified with electronic searches of  the Medline and EMBASE databases. Ongoing trials were checked using the Trials Results Centre website. The direct thrombin inhibitors, and the factor Xa  inhibitors are the two major new anticoagulant drug classes under development at  present. In phase III trials, dabigatran and rivaroxaban demonstrated at least  ","23342992, 24392752, 29063621, 30088449, 24252701, 23394539","Yes, colistin is an antibiotic.","33057672, 30088449, 30892111"
