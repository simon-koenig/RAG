What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Defective control of the histone code contributes to the disease, and restoration of expression of genes controlling H"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes  in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma.

Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading,  removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at  H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that cohesin subunits, which include STAG1 and STAG2, mediate genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types.

TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish.

This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma that usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule"," Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma  usually seen in 1-2% patients with severe coagulative disorder (James et al.,  2003). It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region. We report a rare case occurring in  the mandible of a 14-year-old boy who presented with considerable expansion and displacement of teeth.  ,  Context:  The haemophilic pseudotumor is defined as an encased hematoma that increases of  volume progressively by episodes of recurrent hemorrhage. It is a rare  complication of haemophilia occurring in 1-2% of patients with moderate or severe factor VIII or IX deficiency. Its more frequent location is in the long  bones of low extremities and pelvis. We report a case of a 21-year-old man with  moderate deficiency of factor VIII (19% of normal factor VIII activity) that developed a pseudotumor in the cranium. To our knowledge, this is the third case  of the cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in medical literature.  ,  Context: INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum.  CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial  hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature.

Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family  ,  Context: analysis was used to determine relative protein levels in patient and control  lymphocyte extracts. Northern blotting was used to characterize gene expression  in 1) multiple tissues; 2) developing sciatic nerve; and 3) nerve-crush and  nerve-transection experiments. RESULTS: The authors identified missense mutations (G112S, T115N, W116G) in the  LITAFgene (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor) in  three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster, defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain, involving forebrain and facial malformations that can range from mild to severe."," Context:  Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the  embryonic forebrain. It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can  range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case  series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in  case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted population-based studies. Using data from a population-based birth defects  registry in California, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical  characteristics of cytogenetically and phenotypically distinct types of  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Holoprosencephaly is a disorder of forebrain development  characterized by a failure of the brain to separate into two hemispheres during  early development. It is now clear that many cases of holoprosencephaly are caused by alterations in the genetic programmes that pattern the nervous system.  Less is known about how a holoprosencephalic brain either forms or fails to form  connections between various brain structures. RECENT FINDINGS: Abnormalities in the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract,  medial lemniscus and cerebellar peduncles can be seen in holoprosencephaly.  Diffusion tensor imaging has been and will continue to be an important tool for  ,  Context: brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely  affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average  intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of holoprosencephaly and is important in the counseling of patient and affected  families.  ,  Context: RECENT FINDINGS: Abnormalities in the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract,  medial lemniscus and cerebellar peduncles can be seen in holoprosencephaly.  Diffusion tensor imaging has been and will continue to be an important tool for  imaging white matter in the brain, and will be reviewed here. Furthermore,  recent evidence suggests that holoprosencephaly can be associated with delays or  abnormalities in myelination. The functional implications of white matter  abnormalities in children with holoprosencephaly is only beginning to be  understood. SUMMARY: Modern neuroimaging has led to a better appreciation of the variability  seen in holoprosencephaly, an anomaly known to have multiple etiologies. Recent reviews of the biology of holoprosencephaly identify the condition as a defect  in dorsoventral patterning. More detailed white and grey matter  structure-function studies are likely to shed light on how a brain with drastically altered composition and connectivity does or does not organize  itself to accomplish increasingly complex developmental functions.

The  sequence of the plus strand of each of the BTV genomic double-stranded RNAs is  the same as that of its mRNA, which encodes for a single viral protein, except  the smallest S4 segment which can encode for two nonstructural proteins,  primarily for the release assistance of the viral progeny. The separation and  isolation of each BTV dsRNA segment and viral protein have provided extensive  data related to its viral infection, pathology, suppression of host cellular  functions, and eventual apoptosis of the infected host cells. This cytoplasmic  virus is also an animal killer that costs the U.S. livestock industry at least $125 million yearly. However, this virus has no known effect on humans.

Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"Yes, TAMs can be a good anticancer therapeutic target. Studies have shown that depleting TAMs from tumors or suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype can improve the response of tumors to irradiation and anticancer drugs"," Context: macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer  treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting TAMs with conventional therapy.

Thus, TAMs' re-education  toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication timing through a mechanism independent of the intra-S checkpoint signaling.

Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context:  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that  directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies  suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and  the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this  study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated  repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a  target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) can be used in therapeutics by loading it with complementarity to normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss) to correct exon skipping caused by mutations.

In minigene expression systems, loading of U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss.

We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context: associated to exon skipping in Haemophilia B, cystic fibrosis and spinal  muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively, and the therapeutic splicing rescue by  using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.

Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal  angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in  pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown.

Of these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the  primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the  index tumor, indicating accumulation of de novo mutations during therapy.  Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the 3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of  the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2, and NUFIP1) had high level of  expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential oncogenic driver roles of  these mutated genes. Among them, the druggable G-protein coupled receptor LPAR1  was highly expressed in all tumors. Cells expressing the LPAR1 R163W mutant  demonstrated a significantly increased motility through elevated Rho signaling, but had no effect on growth. Therefore, this study highlights the need for  multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and  combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of  expressed driver mutations.  ,  Context:  Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous  physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array  of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A.  PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies.

The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.

Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19.

Src plays a role in normal thymic epithelial maturation, and its  inhibition with the oral compound saracatinib was postulated to be effective in  controlling thymic malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable thymic malignancy were treated  with saracatinib 175mg by mouth daily in 28 days cycles with radiographic  evaluation at cycle 2 day 1 for safety, then cycle 3 day 1 and every 8 weeks  thereafter. Response was evaluated by RECIST 1.0. A two-stage optimal design was  used, powered to detect a true response rate of 20%. RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment.

Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context: EAST syndrome.

ERG waveforms from light-adapted retinae of all  patients showed reduced amplitudes of the photopic negative response (PhNR) (P <  0.001). The photopic ERGs showed a delay in b-wave time to peak, but the  photopic hill, i.e. the relative variation of time to peak and amplitude with  luminance flash strength, was preserved. Scotopic ERGs to flash strengths 0.01  to 0.1 phot cd s/m2 showed a delay of up to 20 ms before the onset of the b-wave  in two patients compared to controls. Stimulus–response functions were fitted by Michaelis–Menten equations and showed significantly lower retinal sensitivity in  two patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Our study for the first time in the  human ERG shows changes in association with KCNJ10 mutations affecting a Muller cell K+ channel. These data illustrate the role of KCNJ10 function in the  physiology of proximal and possibly also the distal human retina.  ,  Context: conducted a multicenter, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of  continuous dose-intense TMZ for recurrent GBM.

What is etarfolatide used for?,I am uncertain about what etarfolatide is used for.," Context: Edaravone (MCI-186) is a novel synthetic free radical scavenger intended to have  neuroprotective effect against ischemic insult. It is currently used on patients  with cerebral infarction. Here, we note beneficial pharmaceutical effects of  edaravone in rat experimental traumatic brain injury. Under specific  experimental conditions, edaravone minimized traumatic brain injury by  functioning as a synthetic antioxidant. Clinical trials testing the efficacy of  edaravone are warranted.  ,  Context: oxidative DNA damage. Edaravone significantly suppressed axonal injury and  oxidative stress in the cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus 24h after  injury. The neuroprotective effects of edaravone were observed in mice receiving  1.0, 3.0, or 10mg/kg of edaravone immediately after impact, but not after  0.3mg/kg of edaravone. With treatment 1h after impact, axonal injury was also  significantly suppressed and this therapeutic effect persisted up to 6h after  impact. Furthermore, behavioral tests performed 9 days after injury showed  memory deficits in saline-treated traumatized mice, which were not evident in  the edaravone-treated group. These results suggest that edaravone protects against memory deficits following TBI and that this protection is mediated by  suppression of TAI and oxidative stress.  ,  Context: to the use of folates as a supplement to MTX in the treatment of RA was reviewed  and other papers referred to as references were explored. RESULTS: The use of supplemental folates, including folic and folinic acid, in  RA patients treated with MTX has been shown to improve continuation rates by  reducing the incidence of liver function test abnormalities and gastrointestinal  intolerance. Folate supplements do not appear to significantly reduce the  effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, supplemental folic  acid offsets the elevation in plasma homocysteine associated with the use of  MTX. This may in turn reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is over-represented amongst patients with RA, and for which hyperhomocysteinaemia  is now recognized as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that folic acid supplements be prescribed routinely to all patients receiving MTX for the treatment of RA. We recommend a pragmatic  dosing schedule of 5 mg of oral folic acid given on the morning following the  day of MTX administration.  ,  Context: symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract.  Significant morbidity is associated with the development of esophageal  strictures in some patients. Immune-mediated reactions to food allergens appear  to drive the inflammation in a subset of patients, especially those with  solitary EE, but dietary interventions remain difficult in EE and are less  effective in EG. Despite the increasing incidence of these disorders and their  increased recognition by physicians, there are currently no medications that  either United States or European Union regulatory agencies have specifically  approved for use in EGIDs. This lack of safe and effective therapies for EGIDs is a major obstacle in the care of these patients and underscores the need for  new therapeutic approaches. This review briefly discusses the currently  available 'off label' drug treatments for EGIDs, most notably topical and systemic corticosteroids.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"No specific organ is mentioned in the provided text as being constructed using 3D printing technology. However, it does mention that the ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for clinical implant"," Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: engineering.

The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is a paralog of UPC2 in yeast.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data  indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  ","23385756, 28986257, 12836700, 24163365",the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 play a crucial role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation.,"10073572, 24163365, 26448198, 11208779, 28379181, 28986257, 18487346, 1885560, 23385756, 21980509, 24453983"
What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations.

A larger study powered for  ,  Context: Diuretics belong to the basic group of medicines for the treatment of  hypertension and heart failure. In the case of hypertension treatment, their  main indication is higher age and isolated systolic hypertension. In the case of  heart failure they are used for the treatment of swellings and shortness of  breath. The most frequently prescribed group of diuretics is thiazides and  similar products. In patients with renal insufficiency, loop diuretics are  administered. In the case of hypertension, diuretics are mainly used in the  combination treatment. The most frequently used diuretic in combination is again  hydrochlorothiazide, which is combined with reninangiotensin system blockers. It is mainly the combination of an ACE inhibitor + indapamide that seems to be  modern and promising, and it is, on the basis of large clinical trials,  recommended also for diabetics (ADVANCE) or for secondary prevention following a cerebrovascular accident (PROGRESS) or for the elderly (HYVET). Also a  combination of two diuretics is popular -  mainly hydrochlorothiazide +  amiloride. A combination of a betablocker and diuretic is less suitable.  ,  Context: contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.

For many years, surgery  represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are  observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical  treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and  in ameliorating patient conditions.  AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment.

In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"According to recent studies, the DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning.

Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8  genes. METHODS: The involvement of TLR7 and TLR8 in the aetiology of asthma and related  disorders was investigated by a family based association analysis of two  independently ascertained family samples comprising 540 and 424 individuals from  135 and 100 families, respectively. Ten affected individuals from families  showing evidence of linkage to Xp22 were screened for sequence variations in  TLR7 and 8, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were  tested for association. RESULTS: In both samples, significant associations were observed for single SNPs and haplotypes of both TLR7 and 8 in all four phenotypes investigated: asthma,  rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and increased specific IgE.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,The ligand of the Roundabout (Robo) family receptors is Slit protein.," Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have  ,  Context:  The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"Waardenburg syndrome, type II, and congenital Horner syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum. These syndromes disrupt the pathway of tyrosinase induction, leading to a deficiency in melanin production of the iris"," Context:  BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well  described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated  with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare. METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in  ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic  testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed. RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: An 18-year-old Indian girl with upper lip deformity presented with on and off  painless swelling of her both upper eyelids for 3 years. Clinical evaluation  revealed bilateral blepharochalasis, narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure,  decreased outer intercanthal distance, iris coloboma, cleft soft palate, bifid  uvula, sensorineural deafness and double upper lip. Clinical examination of the  thyroid, thyroid hormone assay and ultrasonography revealed normal thyroid gland  structure and function. Ascher's syndrome was diagnosed. To our knowledge, this  is the first reported case of Ascher's syndrome associated with iris coloboma,  heterochromia iridum, and narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure and decreased outer intercanthal distance secondary to lengthening of lateral  canthal ligament.  ,  Context:  The purpose of this study is to report a new and promising method for changing  iris color in a sectorial heterochromia iridis patient. A 22-year-old man with a  complaint of innate color disparity between his eyes presented to our clinic to seek medical advice. He underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination,  including visual acuity, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  measurements, endothelial cell count, and evaluation of iridocorneal angle.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone has central effects on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue. However, it is uncertain whether thyronamines have direct effects on fat tissue."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis.

Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in TPOAb concentrations. Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free  thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality  of life estimation.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) serves as a chromatin organizer in building complex chromatin structure by linking chromosomal domains.," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are organized into higher order chromatin architectures by  protein-mediated long-range interactions in the nucleus. CCCTC-binding factor  (CTCF), a sequence-specific transcription factor, serves as a chromatin  organizer in building this complex chromatin structure by linking chromosomal  domains. Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its  interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with  cohesin. This partnership between CTCF and cohesin is emerging as a novel and  perhaps pivotal aspect of gene regulatory mechanisms, in addition to playing a role in the organization of higher order chromatin architecture.  ,  Context: nucleosomes. However, it does not have nucleosome modifying or standard  ATP-dependent remodeling activity, and therefore represents a third class of  chromatin modulating factors. It is also presently unique in the extensive  connections it displays with both transcription and replication: FACT/DUF/CP/SPN  appears to modify nucleosomes in a way that is directly important for the  efficient functioning of both RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases. While less is  known about the mechanisms it uses to promote its functions than for other  factors that affect chromatin, it is clearly an essential part of the complex  mixture of activities that modulate access to DNA within chromatin. Physical and genetic interactions suggest that FACT/DUF/CP/SPN affects multiple pathways  within replication and transcription as a member of several distinct complexes.  Some of the interactions are easy to assimilate into models for replication or transcription, such as direct binding to DNA polymerase alpha (Wittmeyer and  Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer et al. 1999), association with nucleosome modifying  complexes (John et al. 2000), and interaction with factors that participate in  ","21948239, 29522506, 22952237, 12596908","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.","29209056, 26240385, 24824069, 27773677, 28575439, 27742736, 24998386, 33176147, 31209209, 31211995, 29157917"
