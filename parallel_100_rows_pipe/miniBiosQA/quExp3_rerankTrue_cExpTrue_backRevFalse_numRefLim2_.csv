What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that cohesin, a complex where STAG1 and STAG2 are core components, mediates genome compartmentalisation and regulation"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.

The recent studies reach very  different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone  studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the  Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the  ","24064953, 19356911","The association between cell phone use and incident glioblastoma remains unclear.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by abnormal deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in many regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized  by abnormal deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in many regions of the central  and peripheral nervous systems. Accumulating evidence suggests that the α-synuclein pathology initiates in a few discrete regions and spreads to larger  areas in the nervous system. Recent pathological studies of PD patients have  raised the possibility that the enteric nervous system is one of the initial sites of α-synuclein aggregation and propagation.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

These  agents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic  diseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process.  Cytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They  include agents that act against tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α) (etanercept,  infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL)  6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL‑1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept),  IL‑17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors.  Lymphocyte‑targeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B cells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation  modulator. tsDMARDs, also known as small‑molecule inhibitors, are oral drugs  based on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4  inhibitors (apremilast) form this group.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,TAMs have been considered a vital therapeutic target in cancer therapy due to their role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis.," Context:  Although M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as a  vital therapeutic target in cancer therapy due to their role in promoting tumor  progression and metastasis, very few compounds have been identified to inhibit M2-like polarization of TAMs. Here, we showed that Imatinib significantly  prevented macrophage M2-like polarization induced by IL-13 or IL-4 in vitro, as  illustrated by reduced expression of cell surface marker CD206 and M2-like genes, including Arg1, Mgl2, Mrc1, CDH1, and CCL2. Further, the migration of  lung cancer cells promoted by the conditioned medium from M2-like macrophages  could be restrained by Imatinib.

Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor  progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic approach could be envisioned in cancer therapy.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles.," Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing. Open chromatin regions allow regulatory elements  such as transcription factors and polymerases to bind for gene expression while  closed chromatin regions prevent the activity of transcriptional machinery.  Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual  templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and  methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling  chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Therefore,  there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  ,  Context: DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning are two key mechanisms that  contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression. During carcinogenesis,  the expression of many genes is altered alongside extensive changes in the  epigenome, with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA  hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. However the  spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been  extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and  Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, coleoid cephalopods actually use RNA editing more frequently, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is.," Context:  Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires  detailed evaluation of the patient.

Thyroid gland  toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is  called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case  of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.  ,  Context: TLR was dispensable after 6 wk of infection. The susceptibility of  TLR9(-/-)-infected animals to Brucella paralleled with lower levels of IFN-γ  produced by mouse splenocytes stimulated with this pathogen compared with  wild-type cells.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates embryonic development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. In fibroblasts, it is involved in maintaining the expression of genes enriched in AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR."," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ","23223443, 23401122","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"In the UK, two systematic reviews have concluded that prostate cancer screening should not be carried out, a recommendation generally accepted in the United Kingdom."," Context:  INTRODUCTION: Screening for prostate cancer with serum prostate specific antigen  (PSA) remains a controversial topic. The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive  guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing this test. This study aims to assess men's knowledge of the PSA test at the time  of their referral and their attitude towards screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 men referred to urology via the 'fast track' prostate cancer service were recruited into the study. Of these, 191 were  referred from primary care and 28 from secondary care. All men completed a  questionnaire regarding their knowledge and expectation of the test.  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, which can lead to autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in Caenorhabditis elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"There is no mention of a mediator in the provided context. However, chromatin insulators are mentioned as being involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation."," Context: The spatial organization of metazoan genomes has a direct influence on  fundamental nuclear processes that include transcription, replication, and DNA  repair. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms that shape the 3D  organization of the eukaryotic genomes. Chromatin insulators have emerged as one  of the central components of the genome organization tool-kit across species.  Recent advancements in chromatin conformation capture technologies have provided  important insights into the architectural role of insulators in genomic  structuring. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple  spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. In this review, we will  discuss the classical view and our renewed understanding of insulators as global  genome organizers. We will also discuss the plasticity of chromatin structure and its re-organization during pluripotency and differentiation and in  situations of cellular stress.  ,  Context:  The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including  gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair.  Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.
