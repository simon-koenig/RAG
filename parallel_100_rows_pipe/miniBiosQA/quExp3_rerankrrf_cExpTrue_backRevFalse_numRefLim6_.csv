What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), has been implicated in medulloblastoma. Focal amplifications and homozygous deletions in genes targeting hist"," Context:  We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: which hinder histone methylation and are implicated in oncogenesis, are recently  identified in several cancer disease and called oncohistones. Well-known  oncohistones, with mutations on both H3.1 and H3.3, include H3K36M in  chondroblastoma, H3K27M in glioma, and H3G34 mutations that exist in bone  cancers and gliomas. Oncohistone expression can lead to epigenome/transcriptome  reprogramming and eventually to oncogenesis. The H3K27M, H3G34V/R, and H3K36M  histone mutations can lead to the substitution of amino acid(s) at or near a  lysine residue, which is a methylation target. H3K27M characteristically exists  in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (pediatric DIPG), and its expression can cause a global decrease of the methylation of histone at the lysine residue.  Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of H3K27M-driven tumorigenesis has recently  led to the identification of some potential therapeutic targets in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this chapter, we will review and summarize recent  studies on the H3K27M-driven tumorigenic mechanisms and properties and the role  of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones in brain tumors.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"STAG1/STAG2 proteins do not have a direct role in differentiation mentioned in the given context. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation, suggesting an indirect effect on cellular processes"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of various DUSPs in human umbilical vein  endothelial cells exposed to Ang-1 was measured. The functional roles of DUSPs  in Ang-1-induced regulation of MAPK activation, endothelial cell survival,  migration, differentiation, and permeability were measured using selective siRNA  oligos. Ang-1 differentially induces DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 in human umbilical  vein endothelial cells through activation of the PI-3 kinase, ERK1/2, p38, and  SAPK/JNK pathways. Lack-of-function siRNA screening revealed that DUSP1  preferentially dephosphorylates p38 protein and is involved in Ang-1-induced  cell migration and differentiation. DUSP4 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK proteins and, under conditions of serum deprivation,  is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration, several antiapoptotic effects, and  differentiation. DUSP5 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2 proteins and is involved in cell survival and inhibition of permeability. CONCLUSIONS: DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 differentially modulate MAPK signaling  pathways downstream of Tie-2 receptors, thus highlighting the importance of  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Dental mesenchymal stem cells (dMSCs) might differentiate into  odontoblast-like cells and form mineralized nodules. In the current study, we  investigated the effects of senescence on odontogenic differentiation of dMSCs.  METHODS: dMSCs were serially subcultured until senescence. Telomere lengths and  telomerase activities were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, eg, Bmi-1, p16(INK4A), osteocalcin (OC), dentin sialoprotein (DSP), bone  sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1) were assayed by Western  blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exogenous Bmi-1 was expressed in dMSCs by using retroviral vectors. Odontogenic  differentiation was assayed by alkaline phosphatase activity. RESULTS: Subculture-induced replicative senescence of dMSCs led to reduced  ,  Context: show that JARID2 is sufficient to recruit PcG proteins to a heterologous  promoter, and that inhibition of JARID2 expression leads to a major loss of PcG  binding and to a reduction of H3K27me3 levels on target genes. Consistent with  an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that  JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus,  these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG  proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper  differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development.  ,  Context: the transcription of H19 long non-coding RNA. Demethylation assays using  immunoprecipitated mdig and histone H3 peptide substrate suggested that mdig is  able to remove the methyl groups from H3K9me3. Clinically, we found that higher  levels of mdig and H19 expression correlate with poorer survival of the lung  cancer patients. Taken together, our results imply that mdig is involved in the  regulation of H3K9me3 to influence the heterochromatin structure of the genome  and the expression of genes important for cell growth or transformation.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"A hazard ratio (HR) of 1.2 was found for glioblastoma with >10-year latency, indicating a possible increased risk of glioblastoma associated with long-term cell phone use. Additionally, in the highest tertile (>"," Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: Utilization behavior (UB) consists of reaching out and using objects in the  environment in an automatic manner and out of context. This behavior has been  correlated to frontal lobe dysfunction, especially of the right hemisphere. We  describe a 60-year-old woman, affected by a glioblastoma located in the right  frontal region, who presented with intermittent UB of the mobile phone as the  main clinical manifestation of partial complex status epilepticus. Video/EEG  studies showed a striking correlation between mobile phone utilization and ictal  epileptic activity. Clinical and EEG findings were markedly reduced after the  introduction of antiepileptic drugs. This case study suggests that UB may be added to the symptoms described for partial seizures originating from frontal  areas.  ,  Context: A practical mathematical model for glioblastomas (brain tumours), which  incorporates the two key parameters of tumour growth, namely the cancer cell  diffusion and the cell proliferation rate, has been shown to be clinically  useful and predictive. Previous studies explain why multifocal recurrence is  inevitable and show how various treatment scenarios have been incorporated in  the model. In most tumours, it is not known when the cancer started. Based on  patient in vivo parameters, obtained from two brain scans, it is shown how to  estimate the time, after initial detection, when the tumour started. This is an  input of potential importance in any future controlled clinical study of any connection between cell phone radiation and brain tumour incidence. It is also  used to estimate more accurately survival times from detection. Finally, based  on patient parameters, the solution of the model equation of the tumour growth helps to explain why certain patients live longer than others after similar  treatment protocols specifically surgical resection (removal) and irradiation.  ,  Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in any genome. It has been tested on the fly genome as a case study, but its applicability is not limited to this specific"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context: Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when  developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where  predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on  experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been  renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several  hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been  used for training ID predictors. RESULTS: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on  the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant  amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work  quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is  different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound  ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction  ,  Context: the treatment did not comprise all components specified in the DBT manual or in  the suggestions for inpatient DBT programs, patients failed to be diagnosed  according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the  intervention group comprised fewer than 10 patients. Using a mixed-effect  hierarchical modeling approach, we calculated global effect sizes and effect  sizes for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors.  RESULTS: Calculations of postintervention global effect sizes were based on 16  studies. Of these, 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 8 were  neither randomized nor controlled (nRCT). The dropout rate was 27.3% pre- to posttreatment. A moderate global effect and a moderate effect size for suicidal  and self-injurious behaviors were found, when including a moderator for RCTs  with borderline-specific treatments. There was no evidence for the influence of other moderators (e.g., quality of studies, setting, duration of intervention).  A small impairment was shown from posttreatment to follow-up, including 5 RCTs  only. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should compare DBT with other active  ,  Context: countries. This pilot study explored the efficacy of an mHealth campaign using  SMS as a platform to disseminate and measure HIV/AIDS knowledge, and to promote  HIV/AIDS testing at clinics in rural Uganda. Over a 1-month period, 13 HIV/AIDS  quiz questions were sent to 10,000 mobile subscribers. Despite participation  incentives, only one-fifth of the mobile subscribers responded to any of the  questions. The campaign had proportionately limited success in increasing  knowledge levels on a mass scale. Furthermore, the program design may be  reinforcing entrenched knowledge gaps. The results suggest that it is important  to be conservative when considering the potential overall effect of SMS-based programs. However, the authors recognize the potential of mHealth tools when  extended to millions of mobile phone users as part of an integrated health  campaign approach. The authors propose several steps to improve the program design to reach a larger portion of the intended audience and increase campaign  effectiveness.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context: formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.

The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of  genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease (LBD) is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonism, and visual hallucinations."," Context: of neurons and glia. Abnormal filamentous aggregates of misfolded  alpha-synuclein protein are the major components of Lewy bodies, dystrophic  (Lewy) neurites, and the Papp-Lantos filaments in oligodendroglia and neurons in  multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare  ,  Context:  Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context:  It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some  manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types  within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the  form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive  neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).," Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: questionnaires were collected, after which the NoSAS score was compared against  the other questionnaires for SDB screening. RESULTS: A total of 2,208 participants were enrolled in this study. The NoSAS  scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of ≥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening. A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Screening methods have become increasingly important due to the  growing number of patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  being referred to sleep clinics. The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference,  Obesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily  employed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease.  The score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if they have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool  for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. METHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by primary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had  undergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Raoultella terrigena, a bacterial species, is associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) production."," Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context: Suspected tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning was associated with eating unknown fish  in April 2009 in Taiwan. After ingestion of the fish, symptoms of the victim  included perioral paresthesia, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, weakness of all limbs,  respiration failure, and death within several hours. The toxicity in the  remaining fish was determined, with the mice exhibiting symptoms of neurotoxin  poisoning. The implicated fish and deceased victim tissues were analyzed for TTX by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The urine, bile,  cerebrospinal fluid (spinal cord), pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion of  the victim contained TTX. In addition, the partial cytochrome b gene of the implicated fish was determined by PCR. The DNA sequence in the partial 465-bp  cytochrome b gene identified the implicated fish as Chelonodon patoca (puffer  fish). These results indicate that people should avoid eating unknown fish  ,  Context: Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins,  tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development. Adults  of some species may be insensitive to toxins but early stages are more prone to  intoxication because they lack effective enzymatic systems to detoxify the  ,  Context: A total of 155 puffers caught from two of Thailand's seas, the Gulf of Siam and  the Andaman seas, during April to July 2010 were included in this study. Among  125 puffers from the Gulf of Siam, 18 were Lagocephalus lunaris and 107 were L.  spadiceus which were the same two species found previously in 2000-2001. Thirty  puffers were collected from the Andaman seas, 28 Tetraodon nigroviridis and two  juvenile Arothron reticularis; the two new species totally replaced the nine  species found previously in 1992-1993. Conventional mouse bioassay was used to  determine the toxicity in all fish tissue extracts, i.e., liver, reproductive  tissue, digestive tissue and muscle. One of each of the species L. lunaris and L. spadiceus (5.56 and 0.93%, respectively) were toxic. All 28 T. nigroviridis  and 2 A. reticularis (100%) from the Andaman seas were toxic. The toxicity  scores in T. nigroviridis tissues were much higher than in the respective tissues of the other three fish species. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that the main toxic principle was tetrodotoxin  (TTX). This study is the first to report TTX in L. spadiceus. Our findings  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ","22163191, 21549050, 20161971, 22069694, 22690139, 20411115","Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces genetic diversity in the region surrounding the fixed beneficial mutation due to the hitchhiking effect."," Context: novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the  size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard  approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of recombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply  our estimator to deep sequencing data from human immunodeficiency virus  populations.  ,  Context: The evolution of drug resistance in HIV occurs by the fixation of specific,  well-known, drug-resistance mutations, but the underlying population genetic  processes are not well understood. By analyzing within-patient longitudinal  sequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying  processes and allow us to infer the short-term effective population size of the  viral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of  drug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation  at a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that  these fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in the region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the hitchhiking  effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance mutations  involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a resistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked mutations with  it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically reduces genetic  diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance mutation occurs  ,  Context: A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that  h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until fixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of √(N/s) generations, if N  is the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic  diversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other  cases.  ,  Context: combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this  survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and  classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e.,  SFS-based vs. LD-based, as well as their capacity to analyze whole genomes or  just subgenomic regions. Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons  among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and  OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In  equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods  are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on LD exhibit higher true positive rates than SFS-based ones under the model of a  single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is  elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to represent the null hypothesis. When the correct (or similar to the correct) demographic model is  used instead, the false positive rates are considerably reduced. The accuracy of  detecting the true target of selection is decreased in bottleneck scenarios. In  ,  Context: provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.  ,  Context: Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has  recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix  quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This  phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. The fixation of the beneficial allele  not only affects sequence diversity at single neutral loci but also the joint  allele distribution of several partially linked neutral loci. This distribution can be studied using the ancestral recombination graph for samples of partially  linked neutral loci during the selective sweep. To approximate this graph, we  extend recent work by Etheridge et al. (Ann Appl Probab 16:685-729, 2006) and Schweinsberg and Durrett (Ann Appl Probab 15:1591-1651, 2005) using a marked  Yule tree for the genealogy at a single neutral locus linked to a strongly  beneficial one. We focus on joint genealogies at two partially linked neutral  ","22491190, 24465214, 21076829, 28405579, 21705748, 17396267","Selective sweep is a phenomenon in which the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles within a population reduces genetic diversity at partially linked neutral loci.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include LC3, p62/SQSTM1, NBR1, ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members, ULK1, Atg9-WIPI-1, V"," Context: Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic pathway to  isolate and transport cytosolic components to the lysosome for degradation.  Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link  autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming  autophagic membranes, have been identified. To identify conditions or compounds  that affect autophagy, cell systems that efficiently report on autophagic flux are required. Here we describe reporter cell systems based on induced expression  of GFPp62, GFP-NBR1 or GFP-LC3B. The degradation of the fusion proteins was  followed after promoter shut-off by flow cytometry of live cells. All three fusion proteins were degraded at a basal rate by autophagy. Surprisingly, the  basal degradation rate varied for the three reporter fusion proteins. GFP-LC3B  was the most stable protein. GFP-NBR1 was most efficiently degraded under basal  ,  Context: unknown mechanism. In this study, we investigated the involvement of autophagy  in resveratrol-induced cell death and its potential molecular mechanisms in A549  human lung adnocarcinoma cells. Resveratrol-induced growth inhibition and cell  death was assessed by MTT and clonogenic assays. Activation of autophagy was  characterized by monodansylcadaverine, transmission electron microscopy, and  expression of autophagy marker protein LC3. Western blot analysis was used to  study the cell signals involved in the mechanisms of autophagic death.  Intracellular free calcium was detected with Fura2-AM staining. Our results  indicated that resveratrol induced A549 cell death was mediated by autophagy. 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, suppressed resveratrol-induced  autophagic cell death, and knockdown of autophagy-related genes Atg5 and  Beclin-1 with siRNAs reversed RSV-induced cell death. Intracellular free calcium accumulated immediately following resveratrol addition, which led to the  activation of phospho-AMPK and phospho-Raptor, and a reduction in the amount of  phospho-p70S6K. These effects could be reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound  ,  Context: Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a dynamic process for degradation of cytosolic  components. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions,  and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system  responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence  factors for blocking autophagy, whereas others utilize some autophagy components  for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  ,  Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays  ,  Context: the IRGM gene in human populations have also been linked to predisposition to  tuberculosis. There are several areas of most recent growth: first, links  between autophagy regulators and infectious disease predisposition in human  populations; second, demonstration of a role for autophagy in infection control  in vivo in animal models; third, the definition of specific antiautophagic  defenses in highly evolved pathogens; and fourth, recognition of connections  between the ubiquitin system and autophagy of bacteria (and interestingly  mitochondria, which are incidentally organelles of bacterial evolutionary  origin) via a growing list of modifier and adapter proteins including p62/SQSTM1, NDP52, Atg32, Parkin, and Nix/BNIP3L.  ,  Context: The changes in autophagy-related proteins, including LC3, ULK1, AMPK, and LKB,  were determined with immunoblotting analysis in the presence or absence of SFN.  To assess autophagic dynamics, autophagic flux was measured with chloroquine, a  lysosomal inhibitor. The autophagic responsiveness between different HCC cell  lines was compared under the autophagy enhancing conditions. RESULTS: Hep3B cells were significantly more resistant to SFN than Huh7 cells.  Immunoblotting analysis revealed a marked increase in SFN-mediated autophagy  flux in Huh7 cells, which was, however, absent in Hep3B cells. While both  starvation and rapamycin enhanced autophagy in Huh7 cells, only rapamycin increased autophagy in Hep3B cells. Immunoblotting analysis of autophagy  initiation proteins showed that SFN substantially increased phosphorylation of  AMPK and consequently autophagy in Huh7, but not in Hep3B cells. CONCLUSION: The autophagic responsiveness to SFN is distinct between Hep3B and  Huh7 cells. Resistance of Hep3B cells to SFN may be associated with altered  autophagy signaling pathways.

We present  r3Cseq, an R/Bioconductor package designed to perform 3C-seq data analysis in a  number of different experimental designs. The package reads a common aligned  read input format, provides data normalization, allows the visualization of  candidate interaction regions and detects statistically significant chromatin  interactions, thus greatly facilitating hypothesis generation and the  interpretation of experimental results.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, recent studies have indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent"," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  enrichment of genes associated with particular biological processes. Secondly,  disease associated SNPs were mapped on circRNA loci, and Argonaute (Ago)  interaction sites on circular RNAs were identified. We compiled a database of  disease-circRNA association in Circ2Traits (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/),  the first comprehensive knowledgebase of potential association of circular RNAs  with diseases in human.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous non-coding RNAs  characterized by a covalently closed-loop structure generated through a special  type of alternative splicing termed back-splicing. Currently, an increasing body  of evidence has demonstrated that 1) majority of circRNAs are evolutionarily  conserved across species, stable, and resistant to RNase R degradation, and  often exhibit cell-specific, and tissue-specific/developmental-stage-specific  expression and can be largely independent of the expression levels of the linear  host gene-encoded linear RNAs; 2) the biogenesis of circRNAs via back-splicing  is different from the canonical splicing of linear RNAs; 3) circRNA biogenesis is regulated by specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors; 4)  circRNAs regulate biological and pathological processes by sponging miRNAs,  binding to RNA-binding protein (RBP), regulators of splicing and transcription, modifiers of parental gene expression, and regulators of protein translation or  being translated into peptides in various diseases; 5) circRNAs have been  identified for their enrichment and stability in exosomes and detected in body  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large family of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) found in  metazoans. Systematic studies of circRNAs have just begun. Here, we discuss  circRNA biogenesis and functions with a focus on studies indicating great  diversification of circRNAs. We highlight the recent identification of a special  subtype of circRNAs, called EIciRNAs, and their role in transcriptional  regulation. New insights on RNA-RNA interaction and other features associated  with circRNA biology are also discussed.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?","No, there is a drug available to prevent HIV infection. Truvada is approved to prevent HIV infections and is the key pharmaceutical component of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)."," Context:  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental approach to HIV prevention  and consists of antiretroviral drugs to be taken before potential HIV exposure  in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection and continued during periods of risk. An effective PrEP could provide an additional safety net to sexually  active persons at risk, when combined with other prevention strategies. Women  represent nearly 60% of adults infected with HIV and PrEP can be a female-controlled prevention method for women who are unable to negotiate condom  use. Two antiretroviral nucleoside analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor  drugs are currently under trial as PrEP drugs, namely  ,  Context:  Truvada is getting a new lease on life as a preventive agent. It is the only  drug approved to prevent HIV infections, and Truvada is the key pharmaceutical  component of pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is aimed at preventing, rather than treating, HIV infection and transmission.  ,  Context: reviewed for each scale; and each scale was classified as recommended, suggested  or listed based on whether 3, 2, or 1 of the following criteria were met: (1)  used in the assessment of tremor (yes/no), (2) used in published studies by  people other than the developers (yes/no), and (3) successful clinimetric  testing (yes/no). Five tremor severity scales (the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor  Rating Scale, the Bain and Findley Clinical Tremor Rating Scale, the Bain and  Findley Spirography Scale, the Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of  Essential Tremor Rating Scale, and the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor  Rating Assessment Scale), one ADL/disability scale (the Bain and Findley Tremor ADL Scale), one quality-of-life scale (the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor  Questionnaire), and one screening instrument (the Washington Heights-Inwood  Genetic Study of Essential Tremor Rating Scale, version 1) are recommended using these criteria.

The task force recommends that further work with  ,  Context: Introduction: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy  (ART) represent the cornerstones of HIV infection prevention and treatment.  However, despite their high efficacy, the need to take daily oral pill(s)  negatively impacts long-term patient adherence. In some cases, it can also be  associated with drug-drug interactions and adverse gastrointestinal effects, as  well as being a constant reminder to individuals of their HIV status. The  availability of long-acting non-orally administered antiretroviral drugs could,  therefore, be extremely useful. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a second-generation  integrase strand transfer inhibitor, characterized by a relatively high genetic barrier and good antiretroviral potency, which is administrable as a long-acting  injectable suspension (LAI CAB).Areas covered: The authors present and discuss  the efficacy and available safety data of LAI CAB, either when co-administered with rilpivirine (RPV; LAI CAB + RPV) for the treatment of HIV infection, or  when used as single agent for PrEP.Expert opinion: Cabotegravir has the  potential to play a primary role in the treatment and prevention of HIV  ,  Context: regimen of CAB and rilpivirine have demonstrated promising virological activity  in oral as well as in parenteral therapy, which are currently investigated in  phase three trials. Moreover, CAB protected macaques from experimental  simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection and showed promising tolerability  in the first trial in humans for preexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection. CAB  might, therefore, provide the basis of the new treatment paradigm of parenteral  treatment and prevention of HIV infection.  ,  Context: Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are widely used to treat  HIV-1-infected individuals; indeed most first-line antiretroviral therapies  typically include one NNRTI in combination with two nucleoside analogs. In 2008,  the next-generation NNRTI etravirine was approved for the treatment of  HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-experienced individuals, including those  with prior NNRTI exposure. NNRTIs are also increasingly being included in  strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection. For example: (1) nevirapine is used to  prevent mother-to-child transmission; (2) the ASPIRE (MTN 020) study will test  whether a vaginal ring containing dapivirine can prevent HIV-1 infection in women; (3) a microbicide gel formulation containing the urea-PETT derivative  MIV-150 is in a phase I study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics and acceptability; and (4) a long acting rilpivirine formulation is under-development for pre-exposure prophylaxis.

METHODS: This case-control study enrolled patients from the Cancer Hospital of  Jiangsu Province and Jiangsu Province Hospital from 2003 to 2009. Controls were  randomly selected from individuals who visited the same hospital or a  community-based health examination program during the same time period. A 5 ml venous blood sample was obtained from each participant and epidemiological  information was collected on a standard questionnaire.

Aberrant rereplication correlates  with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation  (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse  embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or  cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an  artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC)  in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20  methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding  properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in  higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: proteomes of biological samples or related to diseases (B/D-HPP) and the other  dedicated to a systematic description of proteins as gene products encoded in  the human genome (the C-HPP).

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer, rather than inhibiting it."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context:  Cellular DNA is under constant challenge by exogenous and endogenous genotoxic  stress, which results in both transient and accumulated DNA damage and genomic  instability. All cells are equipped with DNA damage response pathways that trigger DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and, if need be, apoptosis, to eliminate  DNA damage or damaged cells. The consequences of these processes for stem cells  can be profound: diminution in stem cell pools, or, because of altered gene expression, an increased chance for stem cell differentiation or malignant  transformation. Furthermore, a number of DNA repair abnormalities are linked to  premature aging syndromes, and these are associated with defects in the stem  ,  Context:  Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging  disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced  ""progerin"" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression  changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown  that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of  stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA  sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This is accompanied by co-upregulation of neighbouring genes and elevated acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4."," Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of  cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied  ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of  cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals ""blob"" structures within the supragranular  layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have  not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the  activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and  c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period  of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers,  where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in  layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the ""border strips"" of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (>5 h),  the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured,  changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy  ,  Context:  In nearly all metazoans, the earliest stages of development are controlled by  maternally deposited mRNAs and proteins. The zygotic genome becomes  transcriptionally active hours after fertilization. Transcriptional activation during this maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is tightly coordinated with the  degradation of maternally provided mRNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the  transcription factor Zelda plays an essential role in widespread activation of the zygotic genome. While Zelda expression is required both maternally and  zygotically, the mechanisms by which it functions to remodel the embryonic  genome and prepare the embryo for development remain unclear. Using  ,  Context: system, variable effects on the genitourinary tract, and, in general, positive  effects on serum lipid levels. SERMs seem to affect bone density positively,  albeit to variable degrees, depending on the agent being used. The greatest  effect of SERMs has been on the breast, and current SERMs seem to have efficacy  for prevention of breast cancer as opposed to the controversial effect of  estrogen on the breast. Disadvantages of SERMs include exacerbation of  menopausal symptoms and, as with estrogen, an increased incidence of venous  thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. SERMs act by modifying the configuration of the  estrogen receptor. Effects at the gene transcription level seem to be tissue specific, a factor that likely accounts for the variability of clinical action  seen. CONCLUSION: SERMs are a viable option for treatment of various problems  associated with menopause.  ,  Context:  Epigenetic memory plays crucial roles in gene regulation. It not only modulates  the expression of specific genes but also has ripple effects on transcription as  well as translation of other genes. Very often an alteration in expression occurs either via methylation or demethylation. In this context, ""1-carbon  metabolism"" assumes a special significance since its dysregulation by higher  levels of homocysteine; Hcy (known as hyperhomocysteinemia; HHcy), a byproduct of ""1-Carbon Metabolism"" during methionine biosynthesis leads to serious  implications in cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular systems, and a host of  other conditions. Currently, the circular RNAs (circRNAs) generated via  ,  Context: transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) associated with the  promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from NFRs at  the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding  transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts.  These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that  bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of  divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local  spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation  of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone  modification.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive, slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma, occurring in approximately 1-2% of patients with severe hemophilia. It results from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones"," Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context: Bleeding diatheses are a hallmark of hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumor results  from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones or soft tissue spaces. It is  uncommon and is seen in severe cases of hemophilia only 1-2% of the time.  Complications and symptoms arise due to pain and/or compression of surrounding  structures. Pathologic fractures can be associated with intraosseous lesions and  can result from bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of an  osseous hemorrhage. Radiographs may demonstrate expansile lesions of the bones  or increased soft tissue density that may be associated with extra osseous  lesions. Bleeding may also occur within the joint space. These intra-articular hemorrhages can, over time, result in hemophilic arthropathy. The following case  report demonstrates both an expansile lesion of a metacarpal as well as  hemophilic knee arthropathy in an 11 year old.  ,  Context:  Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region. We report a rare case occurring in  the mandible of a 14-year-old boy who presented with considerable expansion and displacement of teeth.  ,  Context: Hemophilic pseudotumor is an uncommon complication seen in approximately 1-2% of  patients with severe hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumors are distinguished into  two subdivisions based on location, proximal or distal. Plain x-rays and CT are  useful in diagnosis, but MR imaging is the diagnostic test of choice because of  its sensitivity to the various blood products. The choice of therapy depends on  many parameters, such as the size of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the  relation with underlying organs. In most cases of asymptomatic hemophilic  pseudotumor, conservative treatment with administration of missing factor as  well as immobilization is recommended. The authors describe a 13-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A, who presented with a tibial pseudotumor a few months  after an injury. He was conservatively treated for a long period, with daily  administration of recombinant factor VIII. His clinical condition improved shortly after therapy induction, but radiological improvement has been moderate.  Case history, imaging findings, and therapeutic options are discussed.  ,  Context:  The haemophilic pseudotumor is defined as an encased hematoma that increases of  volume progressively by episodes of recurrent hemorrhage. It is a rare  complication of haemophilia occurring in 1-2% of patients with moderate or severe factor VIII or IX deficiency. Its more frequent location is in the long  bones of low extremities and pelvis. We report a case of a 21-year-old man with  moderate deficiency of factor VIII (19% of normal factor VIII activity) that developed a pseudotumor in the cranium.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C. The mean topographic thickness variability in  Group A at 1 year was 4.64 ± 1.63 μm (range 1.6 to 8.1 μm) (P<.05). It was 5.77  ± 3.39 μm (range 1.3 to 17.8 μm) in Group B and 1.59 ± 0.79 μm (range 0.6 to 5.6  μm) in Group C. CONCLUSION: Anterior segment OCT indicated a thinner and more homogeneous  remodeled epithelium in the keratoconic eyes treated using the Athens protocol.

UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous  melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence  in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors  include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular  melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases.  Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy,  phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination. Ocular outcomes are best with small tumours not extending close to the optic  disc and/or fovea. Almost 50% of patients develop metastatic disease, which  usually involves the liver, and is usually fatal within 1 year. Although UM  ,  Context: factors. Testing can be performed by trained teachers, technicians, school  nurses and pediatricians as well as by eye care professionals. Once a child is  identified as having an amblyopia risk factor it is crucial that the parents  follow up with a pediatric ophthalmologist for a comprehensive examination.  Amblyopia is the leading cause of monocular vision loss in the United States for  adults under the age of 40. Amblyopia is amenable to therapy and is cost  effective to treat. It is believed that earlier therapy for amblyopia provides  better outcomes, but treatment has been shown effective even in some older  children. In this paper, studies are cited regarding treatment of amblyopia.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To investigate refractive, topometric, pachymetric, and visual  rehabilitation changes induced by anterior surface normalization for keratoconus  by partial topography-guided excimer laser ablation in conjunction with  accelerated, high-fluence cross-linking.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. Additionally, mTORC1 drives HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through"," Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a component of two large  complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth  and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell  proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor  is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in  controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was  specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on  lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell  proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a  was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314,  which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1),  the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated  at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: and spontaneous liver tumors. The signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to regulate liver growth, and STAT3 is  feedback inhibited by its target gene, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3  (SOCS3). Strong activation of STAT3 was detected in FXR(-/-) mouse livers.  However, the mechanism of STAT3 activation with FXR deficiency remains elusive.  Wild-type (WT) and FXR(-/-) mice were used to detect STAT3 pathway activation in  the liver. In vivo BA feeding or deprivation was used to determine the role of  BAs in STAT3 activation, and in vitro molecular approaches were used to  determine the direct transcriptional regulation of SOCS3 by FXR. STAT3 was activated in FXR(-/-) but not WT mice. BA feeding increased, but deprivation by  cholestyramine reduced, serum inflammatory markers and STAT3 activation.  Furthermore, the Socs3 gene was determined as a direct FXR target gene. The elevated BAs and inflammation, along with reduced SOCS3, collectively contribute  to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in the liver of FXR(-/-) mice.  This study suggests that the constitutive activation of STAT3 may be a mechanism  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant  disorder characterized by widespread benign tumor formation in a variety of  organs. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible  for TSC. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin,  respectively, form a physical and functional complex and inhibit the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth promoting pathway. mTORC1 plays an essential  role in a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription,  trafficking and autophagy. In this review, we will discuss recent progresses in the TSC-mTOR field and their physiological functions and alterations of this  pathway in pathophysiology.  ,  Context:  The lysosome plays a key role in cellular homeostasis by controlling both  cellular clearance and energy production to respond to environmental cues.  However, the mechanisms mediating lysosomal adaptation are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of  lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1  (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition  of mTORC1, as well as starvation and lysosomal disruption, activates TFEB by  promoting its nuclear translocation. In addition, the transcriptional response  ","24931163, 24558442, 23641065, 24091600, 19297407, 22343943","mTORC1 was found to regulate STAT3 activity in, at least, three ways: 1) after induction by IL6, 2) by direct phosphorylation during hypoxia, to promote HIF-1α mRNA transcription, and 3) after activation by excess amino acids, which then positively regulate Notch1 expression through STAT3 activation.","22055460, 23641065, 26026060, 24302004, 24931163"
List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context: patients are children or young adults, presenting with headaches or  consciousness disturbances, associated with raised intracranial pressure. Here,  we report on an 83-year-old man presenting with mimic symptoms of idiopathic  normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: Ear, nose and throat symptoms and signs were studied in 15 patients with  Kartagener's syndrome: a triad consisting of chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic  bronchitis with bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. The triad is caused by  primary ciliary dyskinesia and characterized by absent or considerably reduced  mucociliary transport. Daily accumulation of secretions in the nose, chronic  recurrent secretory otitis media and sinusitis occurred in all subjects.  Characteristically, nasal discharge started at birth or was first detected in  early childhood. Apparently, the frequency of common colds and of acute purulent  otitis media was not increased. As primary ciliary dyskinesia can occur without situs inversus, knowledge of the typical ENT symptoms is essential for making an  early diagnosis, which is important for the correct management of the disease.  While a conservative surgical approach to treatment of the ENT symptoms is recommended, early and active treatment of the bronchial symptoms is probably  important for prevention of further lung damage and development of  bronchiectasis.  ,  Context: reviewed the medical records of 36 patients (24 women and 12 men) with elements  of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The complete triad was present in 9 (25%)  patients. Orofacial involvement was the dominant feature; it occurred in all 36  patients and was the presenting sign in 15 (42%). Lingua plicata occurred in 18  (50%) patients, and peripheral facial paralysis was present in 17 (47%).  Fourteen biopsy specimens were obtained, all from the orofacial region. Eight  specimens revealed the classic pathologic picture of granulomatous cheilitis. No  etiologic agent was identified in any of the patients. Diagnosis is difficult  when all features of the triad are not present. A conservative treatment approach is recommended.  ,  Context: The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology  characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial  paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The  orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen,  nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is  indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to  one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence  assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete  form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis  granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably  present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a  ,  Context: METHODS: Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia,  Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA.  Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology,  diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment. RESULTS: Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from  other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the  hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban  areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as  probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and  some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in  other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring  across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results  provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of  ,  Context: reluctant to present. The exact place of hikikomori in psychiatric nosology has  yet to be determined.

However, many of these were cited by subsequent English language papers that  were included in the review. Following scrutiny of the titles and abstracts, 29  were judged to be relevant.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: Hox clusters because of an additional ""teleost-specific"" genome duplication  event. By sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole  genome, here we provide evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese  lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This suggests that the lamprey lineage has  experienced an additional genome duplication after 1R and 2R. The relative age  of lamprey and human paralogs supports this hypothesis. Compared with  gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are unusually large. Several  conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the Hox clusters of  lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in individual  lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in  elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the  first two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the  lamprey and gnathostome lineages.  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental  ,  Context:  Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail.  This poly(A) tail is not encoded in the genome but is added by the process of  polyadenylation. Polyadenylation is a two-step process, and this process is accomplished by multisubunit protein factors. Here, we comprehensively compare  the protein machinery responsible for polyadenylation of mRNAs across many  evolutionary divergent species, and we have found these protein factors to be remarkably conserved in nature. These data suggest that polyadenylation of mRNAs  is an ancient process.  ,  Context: hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the  average yeast gene has an ""end zone,"" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A)  sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The  pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D.  hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF  terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong  bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly  degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A  residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the  cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a  region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii  genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the  polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors.

Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy.

After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus.

CONCLUSIONS: Avapritinib has significant antitumor activity in GIST PDX models  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: Avapritinib (AYVAKIT™) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of  platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop  mutants. It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Clinical development of  avapritinib is also underway for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis and late-stage solid tumours in several countries.  ,  Context: ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological  properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that  avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine  kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor  receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and  ABCG2. Moreover, avapritinib restores the chemosensitivity of ABCB1- and  ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. These findings  were further supported by results of apoptosis induction assays, ATP hydrolysis  assays, and docking of avapritinib in the drug-binding pockets of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Altogether, our study highlights an additional action of avapritinib on  ABC drug transporters, and a combination of avapritinib with conventional  chemotherapy should be further investigated in patients with MDR tumors.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) serve as microRNA sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors, and reservoirs. They also play a crucial role in fine-tuning the level of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression by"," Context: Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs  in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular  RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being  associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with  individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types. Therefore, the present review  evaluated recent research articles in PubMed that were published between November 2017 and September 2020. Key word search strings included: 'Circular  RNA (circRNA) AND bladder cancer (BC)', 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND prostate  cancer (PCa)' and 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND renal cell cancer (RCC)'. In  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context:  Long non-coding RNAs are 200 nucleotide long RNA molecules which lack or have  limited protein-coding potential. They can regulate protein formation through  several different mechanisms. Similarly, circular RNAs are reported to play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Changes in the expression  pattern of these molecules are established to underline various diseases,  including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and immunological disorders. Recent studies suggest that they are differentially expressed both in healthy  ocular tissues as well as in eye pathologies, such as neovascularization,  proliferative vitreoretinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, ocular malignancy or even  ,  Context: It is now clear that there is a diversity of circular RNAs in biological  systems. Circular RNAs can be produced by the direct ligation of 5' and 3' ends  of linear RNAs, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, or by  ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context: MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in the initiation  and progression of many tumors. Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs  (circRNAs) have been described in eukaryotic cells:;they comprise a new class of  gene regulators. Naturally occurring circular miR sponges, which induce miR  loss-of-function, can prevent endogenous onco-miRs from binding to their cognate  mRNA targets. These findings suggest that synthetic (artificial) circular RNAs could be constructed as therapeutic molecular sponges to suppress harmful  onco-miRs. Using enzymatic ligation, we designed and constructed a circular RNA  containing both miR-21 and miR-93 binding sites. The synthetic circular sponge was resistant to digestion with RNase R. Luciferase assays and functional  experiments showed that the circular multi-miR sponge was more stable than its  linear counterpart. Moreover, endogenous miR-21 and miR-93 were inhibited by the  ","24339831, 33649838, 26874353, 30428483, 25404635, 31217510","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of conserved, endogenous non-coding RNAs that are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. including cancer","34110722, 28969093, 34699790, 30791568, 28082450, 33065239, 32059672, 33715625, 30550956, 32667692, 33649838, 34296749, 31897908, 31832126, 33835457, 34542406, 29349062, 29387208, 31178190, 27616979, 33537235, 28634583, 31998941, 28018143, 34535136, 34100450, 32018039, 34258296"

Madey invented and developed the Free Electron LASER  (FEL), a vacuum-tube that uses a beam of relativistic electrons passing through  a periodic, transverse magnetic field (wiggler) to produce coherent radiation,  contained in an optical cavity defined by mirrors. A resonance condition that  involves the energy of the electron beam, the strength of the magnetic field,  and the periodicity of the magnet determines the wavelength of the radiation.  The FEL Coherent Light Sources like the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at  Stanford, CA, USA or the Xray Free Electron LASER (XFEL) at Hamburg, Germany, will work much like a high-speed (< 100 femtoseconds) camera, enabling  scientists to take stop-motion pictures, on the nanoscale, of atoms and  molecules in motion. The curve of FEL-related patents of the last 20 years is much smoother than the corresponding one for in vitro Diagnostics conventional  LASERS. If the diodes brought a LASER into almost everyone's pocket, the  above-mentioned super-imaging systems are huge facilities of enormous cost--the  ,  Context: The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing  the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms. The present method offers a potential for ab initio structural  determination in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography.  ,  Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a  nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects  with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial  resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science  samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the  techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray  free-electron laser sources.  ,  Context: and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge  in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  covering the soft x-ray photon energy range from 500eV to 2000eV and outline the  use of this technique to establish and characterize temporal synchronization of  the optical-laser and FEL x-ray pulses.

Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8.

Based on evidence, the gut microbiota is associated with metabolic disorders  such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and neuropsychiatric disorders such as  schizophrenia, autistic disorders, anxiety disorders and major depressive  disorders. In the past few years, neuroscientific research has shown the importance of the microbiota in the development of brain systems. Recent studies  showed that the microbiota could activate the immune and central nervous  systems, including commensal and pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microorganisms are capable of producing and  delivering neuroactive substances such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid,  which act on the gut-brain axis. Preclinical research in rodents suggested that  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly is a rare brain abnormality resulting from an incomplete  cleavage of the primitive prosencephalon of forebrain during early  embryogenesis. It includes a series of rare complex and heterogenosis disorders.  Alobar form is associated with an extremely poor fetal prognosis. Here we report  three cases of alobar holoprosencephaly and one case of semilobar  holoprosencephaly diagnosed at the third trimester. Causes, diagnosis and management of holoprosencephaly are discussed referring to literature.  ,  Context:  Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the  embryonic forebrain. It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can  range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case  series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in  case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted population-based studies. Using data from a population-based birth defects  registry in California, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical  characteristics of cytogenetically and phenotypically distinct types of  ,  Context: microduplications. We also focus on existing single and double knockout mouse  models that have been used to study human phenotypes, since the highly limited  number of patients makes a study of these conditions difficult in humans.

It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be  ,  Context: WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Propofol, a commonly used sedative, has on rare  occasions, been reported to discolour urine green. However, in previous reports,  it is uncertain that whether this colour change is dose dependent. We report on  a patient who produced dark green discoloration of urine from prolonged propofol  infusion, administered for intractable epilepsy. CASE SUMMARY: The colour intensity of the patient's urine was dependent on propofol infusion rate. Reducing propofol infusion rate lightened the colour of  the urine, eventually back to normal. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Green discoloration of the urine from propofol infusion is dose dependent. It is usually benign and reversible, as was the case  for our patient.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare incidental finding seen on endoscopy and has  the characteristic appearance of flat, black-speckled pigmented mucosa. We  present the case of an 83-year-old woman who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have pseudomelanosis duodeni. The finding has no  diagnostic or prognostic significance. Therapeutic chelation or endoscopic  follow-up is not recommended.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is seen endoscopically as dark spots in the duodenal  mucosa and is generally considered to be local deposition of iron from oral iron  intake. However, pseudomelanosis duodeni may be identified histologically even before it becomes endoscopically evident; iron stainability within the mucosa is  uneven and unpredictable, and multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron  intake may be associated. We reviewed 17 adult patients with histologically detected pseudomelanosis duodeni, their endoscopic appearances, iron  stainability, and clinical findings including oral iron and drug intake. Only  6/17 (35 %) had endoscopically apparent dark spots. Perl's iron stain was  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare, benign condition of unknown etiology. It is  characterized by collection of pigment-laden macrophages in the tips of duodenal  villi.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 regulates T3 binding and cardiac myoblasts differentiation in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: The profound effects of thyroid hormone (TH) on heart development and function  are mediated by the thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha(1) and beta(1). While  numerous patients with TRbeta(1) mutations have been identified, patients with  similar mutations in TRalpha(1) are yet to be discovered. Recently generated  heterozygous mice with a dominant negative mutation in TRalpha(1) (TRalpha(1)+/m  mice) have normal TH levels, which may have hampered the discovery of patients  with such mutations. We now measure intracellular Ca(2+) and contraction in  cardiomyocytes isolated from TRalpha(1)+/m mice and wildtype littermates (WT).  TRalpha(1)+/m cardiomyocytes showed a phenotype similar to that in hypothyroidism with significant slowing of voltage-activated Ca(2+) transients  and contractions. Increased stimulation frequency (from 0.5 to 3 Hz) or  beta-adrenergic stimulation reduced the differences between TRalpha(1)+/m and WT cardiomyocytes. However, in TRalpha(1)+/m cells stimulation at 3 Hz gave a  marked increase in diastolic Ca(2+) and beta-adrenergic stimulation triggered  spontaneous Ca(2+) release events during relaxation.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context: (GBS), a rare immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. We report three cases of  Guillain-Barre Syndrome and one case of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating  Polyneuropathy (CIDP), presenting to a Tasmanian hospital, and review 15 other  reported cases and discuss likely immunopathology. Nearly all reported cases of  post-COVID-19 vacciation inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are linked to  AstraZeneca vaccination and a variant with bifacial weakness is the most  reported form of GBS globally.  ,  Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Recently, severe manifestations associated with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  have been recognized. Analysis of studies for this novel syndrome is needed for  a better understanding of effective management among affected children. METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic  electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers  (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines to retrieve all articles  published from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Observational cross-sectional,  cohort, case series, and case reports were included.  ,  Context: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening  post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or  asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children. Here, we define  immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult  healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen receptor repertoire  analysis, unbiased serum proteomics, and in vitro assays. Despite no evidence of  active infection, we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and  marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways  including cytokines, complement/coagulation, and fluid shear stress in MIS-C patients. Moreover, NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated, and  plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded. Consistently, we detect  elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Thus, we define  immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing  this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,"Yes, ubrogepant has completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine in Phase III."," Context: long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and  ,  Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use.

In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ubrogepant leading to its first global approval for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults.  ,  Context: Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been  submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are among the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context: Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an  anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug  functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus,  rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.

There is no effective  antiviral chemotherapy for most of these pathogens. Paramyxoviruses evolved a  sophisticated membrane-fusion machine consisting of receptor-binding proteins and the fusion F-protein, critical for virus infectivity.

The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context: and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Zika virus is an arbovirus  (arthropod-borne virus) and a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus  Flavivirus. Zika virions are enveloped and icosahedral, and contain a  nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which encodes 3  structural and 7 nonstructural proteins that are expressed as a single  polyprotein that undergoes cleavage. Zika genomic RNA replicates in the  cytoplasm of infected host cells. Zika virus was first detected in 1947 in the  blood of a febrile monkey in Uganda's Zika Forest and in crushed suspensions of  the Aedes mosquito, which is one of the vectors for Zika virus. The virus remained obscure, with a few human cases confined to Africa and Asia. There are  two lineages of the Zika virus, African and Asian, with the Asian strain causing  outbreaks in Micronesia in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013-2014. From here, the virus spread to Brazil with the first report of autochthonous Zika  transmission in the Americas in March 2015.

A few possible  predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of  phylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new  human viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for  the foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system  for novel viruses is needed.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine receptors.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ","33200890, 33229362, 32324502, 32562029, 19649332",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1), histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), and SIRT2. Additionally, MEC"," Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  ,  Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have both pro-tumoral and antitumor functions, but their plasticity allows for reprogramming to support antitumor immune responses. Targeting TAMs has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, suggesting they can be a valuable"," Context: still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting  strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context: Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, encompassing several intrinsic  subtypes with various morphological and molecular features, natural history and  response to therapy. Currently, molecular targeted therapies are available for  estrogen receptor (ER)(-) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  (Her2)-positive breast tumors. However, a significant proportion of primary  breast cancers are negative for ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), and Her2, comprising the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) group. Women with TNBC have  a poor prognosis because of the aggressive nature of these tumors and current  lack of suitable targeted therapies. As a consequence, the identification of novel relevant protein targets for this group of patients is of great  importance. Using a systematic two dimensional (2D) gel-based proteomic  profiling strategy, applied to the analysis of fresh TNBC tissue biopsies, in  ,  Context: treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting  TAMs with conventional therapy.

Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to  deplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as  weapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the  reprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral  macrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells. This  shift eventually leads to the reconstitution of a reactive immune landscape able  to destroy the tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on strategies able to reprogram TAMs with single as well as combination therapies.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, GFI1B is crucial for hematopoiesis as it regulates the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors, controlling the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. Its disruption"," Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context: Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic  progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors  through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The  transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main  downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification  of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation  of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change  characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Transcription factors play essential roles in both normal and  malignant hematopoiesis. This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b  (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic  differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines. DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate GFI1B regulation, we searched for  multispecies conserved non-coding elements between GFI1B and neighboring genes. We used a formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) assay  and DNase1 hypersensitivity to assess the chromatin conformation of these sites.  Next, we analyzed transcription factor binding and histone modifications at the GFI1B locus including the conserved non-coding elements by a chromatin  immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, we studied the interaction of the GFI1B  promoter and the conserved non-coding elements with the chromatin conformation  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context:  Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Whether routine screening for depression among nonpregnant women  of reproductive age improves identification and treatment of the disorder  remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to address 5  key questions specific to this population: 1) What are the current national  clinical practice recommendations and guidelines for depression screening; 2)  What are the prevalence and predictors of screening; 3) How well do screening  tools detect depression; 4) Does screening lead to diagnosis, treatment, and  improved outcomes; and 5) What are the most effective treatment methods? METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases for full-length articles published in English between 1990 and 2010 that addressed at least 1 of our key questions. RESULTS: We identified 5 clinical practice guidelines pertinent to question 1,  and 12 systematic reviews or post-hoc analyses of pooled data that addressed questions 3 through 5. No systematic reviews addressed question 2; however, we  identified 4 individual studies addressing this question.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles.," Context: DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning are two key mechanisms that  contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression. During carcinogenesis,  the expression of many genes is altered alongside extensive changes in the  epigenome, with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA  hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. However the  spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and  Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods  that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published  by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with  ,  Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/. CONTACTS: jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context:  Technological advances have made it possible to measure spatially resolved gene  expression at high throughput. However, methods to analyze these data are not  established. Here we describe SpatialDE, a statistical test to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression variation from multiplexed imaging or  spatial RNA-sequencing data. SpatialDE also implements 'automatic expression  histology', a spatial gene-clustering approach that enables expression-based  tissue histology.  ,  Context: Genomic enhancers are important regulators of gene expression, but their  identification is a challenge, and methods depend on indirect measures of  activity. We developed a method termed STARR-seq to directly and quantitatively  assess enhancer activity for millions of candidates from arbitrary sources of  DNA, which enables screens across entire genomes. When applied to the Drosophila  genome, STARR-seq identifies thousands of cell type-specific enhancers across a broad continuum of strengths, links differential gene expression to differences  in enhancer activity, and creates a genome-wide quantitative enhancer map. This  map reveals the highly complex regulation of transcription, with several independent enhancers for both developmental regulators and ubiquitously  expressed genes. STARR-seq can be used to identify and quantify enhancer  activity in other eukaryotes, including humans.  ,  Context: have increased IFN-regulated gene expression pointing towards a possible  underlying genetic defect. OBJECTIVES: To determine expression levels of five type I IFN-regulated genes  that are highly expressed in SLE in the peripheral blood of patients with CLE  and to correlate the expression levels with cutaneous disease activity. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 healthy controls and 30 patients  with CLE, including eight with concomitant SLE. Total RNA was extracted and  reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Gene expression levels were measured  by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, standardized to healthy controls and then summed to calculate an IFN score for  each patient. Disease activity was assessed with the Cutaneous Lupus Area and  Severity Index (CLASI). RESULTS: Patients with subacute CLE (SCLE) and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)  had elevated IFN scores compared with healthy controls regardless of concomitant  SLE (P < 0·01 with SLE and P < 0·05 without SLE). There was no difference  ,  Context: regulators of transcription, varying by promoter and differentiation state of  the cell. The Mediator complex, a ubiquitous conserved complex of approximately  30 subunits, facilitates transcription by coordinating RNA polymerase II binding  to target promoters via gene-specific activators and can be divided into several  functional subcomplexes. Med12 is part of a subcomplex of four proteins  associated with the core Mediator complex and has been found to function both in  repressing and activating transcription when recruited to target promoters. We  identified an interaction between Med12 and Nanog and present evidence of  involvement of Med12 in regulation of Nanog function. Gene expression analysis of embryonic stem cells knocked down for Med12 showed a similarity to Nanog  knockdown, with increased expression of Nanog-repressed targets and decreased  expression of Nanog-activated targets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that Med12 and Nanog co-occupied Nanog target promoters in embryonic stem  cells and that Med12 dissociated from target promoters upon differentiation with  kinetics similar to Nanog.

Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and left-hand dominance have  been proposed as markers of prenatal hormone exposure. AIM: To evaluate associations between 2D:4D digit ratio, right minus left 2D:4D (ΔR-L), and left-hand dominance and TGCT in the U.S. Servicemen's Testicular  Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study. METHODS: A total of 246 TGCT cases and 236 non-testicular cancer controls  ,  Context: and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether 2D:4D measures are associated with breast  cancer risk. METHODS: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers  (2D:4D), and right minus left 2D:4D (Δ(r-l)) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants' hands collected during a recent follow-up of the  Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469  women. Of the 9044 women with available data, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a one  standard deviation difference in 2D:4D measures were obtained from Weibull  survival models, and linear regression models were used to examine potential  ,  Context:  The second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic trait with  lower finger ratios considered more masculine. These digit ratios are believed  to reflect the prenatal hormonal environment with higher exposure to androgens in utero leading to more masculine digit ratios.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context:  Because genetic alterations including mutations, overexpression, translocations,  and dysregulation of protein kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of many  illnesses, this enzyme family is currently the subject of many drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical industry. The US FDA approved four small molecule  protein kinase antagonists in 2019; these include entrectinib, erdafitinib,  pexidartinib, and fedratinib. Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for  ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth  factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers.  ,  Context: effect of these drugs will be limited in vivo by the development of drug  resistance, and pre-clinical studies of G12C inhibitors have identified evidence  of this. In this review we discuss the current evidence for G12C inhibitors, the  mechanisms of resistance to G12C inhibitors and potential approaches to overcome  them. We discuss possible targets of combination therapy, including SHP2,  receptor tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors and PD1/PDL1, and review the  ongoing clinical trials investigating these inhibitors.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML.

Left ventricular  non-compaction is a cardiomyopathy often associated with neuromuscular disorders. We report the case of a 61-year-old man with DM2 treated for 5 years  for a suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography showed left ventricular  non-compaction typical pattern, with prominent apical trabeculations and intertrabecular spaces perfused from ventricular cavity. MRI confirmed the  diagnosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe cardiac  complications in DM2 patients.

AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of  15 adult patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 ± 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and  July 2010.

Since the clinical  manifestations are not sufficient to establish diagnosis, echocardiography is the diagnostic tool that makes it possible to document ventricular  non-compaction and establish prognostic factors. We report a 47-year-old woman  with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with unknown etiology. Echocardiography showed mild left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction (EF =  20-25%).

METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context: Cardiomyopathies are classified according to distinct morphological  characteristics. They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected  ,  Context: immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are  presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize work on the expression and purification of the full-length protein, and then  focus on the design, expression, and purification of an active C-terminal  polymerase fragment. The generation of this active construct was nontrivial and time consuming. Almost all published biochemical work to date has been performed  with this domain fragment. Strategies to obtain and improve crystals of a  ternary pol θ complex (enzyme:DNA:nucleotide) are also presented, along with key  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context: (one-third of the species analyzed) or multisegmental (the rest). Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. This is achieved through PP"," Context: timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end,  and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context:  Rif1, originally recognized for its role at telomeres in budding yeast, has been  implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes in mammals, including  pluripotency of stem cells, response to double-strand breaks, and breast cancer development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair.

G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We  ,  Context: cancer tissues and identify a previously unannotated lncRNA, FLJ39051, that we  term GSEC (G-quadruplex-forming sequence containing lncRNA), as a lncRNA that is  upregulated in colorectal cancer. We further demonstrate that knockdown of GSEC  results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex  structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s.  Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4  ,  Context: The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to  maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation  initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent  helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental  mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4  substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward  G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4  substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of  the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between  the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by  DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin  to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our  study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive  ,  Context: DNA replication. In addition, G-quadruplex binding proteins also affect the  structure and function of G-quadruplexes. Some chemically synthesized  G-quadruplex sequences have been shown to have biological activities. For  example, bimolecular G-quadruplexes of AS1411 act as targets of exogenous drugs  that inhibit the proliferation of malignant tumours. G-quadruplexes are also  used as vehicles to deliver nanoparticles. Thus, it is important to identify the  factors that influence G-quadruplex structures and maintain the stability of  G-quadruplexes. Herein, we mainly discuss the factors influencing G-quadruplexes  and the synthetic G-quadruplex, AS1411.

A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is  particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the  design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and  whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs  abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can  also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo  transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for  species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has  ,  Context: Data analysis in proteomics is complex and with the extra challenges involved in  the interpretation of data from N-terminomics experiments, this can be  daunting.Therefore, we have devised a rational pipeline of steps to approach  N-terminomics data analysis in a statistically based and valid manner. We have  automated these steps in CLIPPER, an add-on to the Trans-Proteomic  Pipeline(TPP). Applying CLIPPER to the analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high  confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization  and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.  ,  Context: RESULTS: We present here an R package for the statistical analysis of ChIP-seq  experiments. Taking the average size of DNA fragments subjected to sequencing  into account, the software calculates single-nucleotide read-enrichment values.  After normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the  ratio test or the Poisson distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the  false discovery rate are obtained through random permutations. Computational  efficiency is achieved by implementing the most time-consuming functions in C++  and integrating these in the R package.

It has five," Context: Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for  studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms.  This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,  allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant  developing context. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with  the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC partnership as an illustrative test case. This protocol applies to any  transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general.  ,  Context: Transcriptional repressors function primarily by recruiting co-repressors, which  are accessory proteins that antagonize transcription by modifying chromatin  structure. Although a repressor could function by recruiting just a single  co-repressor, many can recruit more than one, with Drosophila Brinker (Brk)  recruiting the co-repressors CtBP and Groucho (Gro), in addition to possessing a  third repression domain, 3R. Previous studies indicated that Gro is sufficient for Brk to repress targets in the wing, questioning why it should need to  recruit CtBP, a short-range co-repressor, when Gro is known to be able to  function over longer distances. To resolve this we have used genomic engineering to generate a series of brk mutants that are unable to recruit Gro, CtBP and/or  have 3R deleted. These reveal that although the recruitment of Gro is necessary  and can be sufficient for Brk to make an almost morphologically wild-type fly,  ,  Context:  Drosophila Groucho (Gro) is the founding member of a family of metazoan  corepressors.

To  determine the features of the three HP1 homologs, we performed the first comprehensive comparative analysis of Drosophila HP1 homologs. HP1  differentially homodimerizes and heterodimerizes in vivo and in vitro HP1b and  HP1c, but not HP1a, are localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The C-terminal extension region (CTE) targets HP1c and HP1b to the cytoplasm.  Biochemical approaches show that HP1 binds to various interacting partners with  different binding affinities. Each HP1 associates differently with RNA  ,  Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates.

The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context: expedited in a more tractable model organism, such as Drosophila melanogaster.  To this end, we defined a set of 1,119 putative lincRNA genes in D. melanogaster  using modENCODE whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. A large majority (1.1 of 1.3  Mb; 85%) of these bases were not previously reported by modENCODE as being  transcribed. Significant selective constraint on the sequences of these loci  predicts that virtually all have sustained functionality across the Drosophila  clade. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles  that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation  of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. We identify lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in  male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified  whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between D. melanogaster and mouse. This study predicts that the genomes of not only  vertebrates, such as mammals, but also an invertebrate (fruit fly) harbor large  numbers of lincRNA loci.

Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This  review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: were confirmed.

He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating  drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context: Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare  disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia  resulting from renal phosphate wasting. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a  noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone  mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations  in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we  describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a  novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a  50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage. Biochemical examination revealed  hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate excretion and low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D.  Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were within the normal range, leading to clinical diagnosis of ARHR.

We measured soluble Klotho and FGF23 levels at  enrolment and two weeks later in 239 prevalent hemodialysis patients. The  primary hypothesis was that low Klotho and high FGF23 are associated with increased mortality. The association between Klotho and atrial fibrillation (AF)  at baseline was explored as secondary outcome. AF was defined as presence of  paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains, suggesting its association with DNA replication. Specifically, disruption of H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, and PR-Set7-mediated"," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: alterations in their pathobiology. A central molecular event underlying  epigenetics is the alteration of chromatin structure by post-translational  modifications of DNA and histones as well as nucleosome repositioning. Dynamic  remodeling of the fundamental nucleosomal structure of chromatin or covalent  histone marks located in core histones regulate main cellular processes  including DNA methylation, replication, DNA-damage repair as well as gene  expression. Deregulation of these processes has been linked to tumor suppressor  gene silencing, cancer initiation and progression. The reversible nature of  deregulated chromatin structure by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation inhibitors, leading to re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, makes  chromatin-remodeling pathways as promising therapeutic targets. In fact, a  considerable number of these inhibitors are being tested today either alone or in combination with other agents or conventional treatments in the management of  brain tumors with considerable success. In this review, we focus on the  mechanisms underpinning deregulated chromatin remodeling in brain tumors,  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.  ,  Context: important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important  functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: histone (H3-H4)(2) tetramer splitting activity, does not form efficiently a  quaternary complex with histones H3-H4 and the minichromosome maintenance 2  (Mcm2) subunit of the Mcm2-7 replicative DNA helicase.

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB gene.," Context: remained uncertain until recently Gitelman's syndrome, the  hypokalemic-hypomagnesemic variant with hypocalciuria, was linked to the gene  encoding the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl-cotransporter (TSC) located on chromosome  16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome  ,  Context: Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding  several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb,  Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR. We review the pathophysiology of these syndromes in relation to their clinical  presentation.  ,  Context: Bartter's syndrome, a rare disorder affecting the renal tubular potassium  handling, is characterized by metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia and renal salt  wasting. Here we describe a patient with Bartter's syndrome with hitherto  undescribed clinical features and also discuss the various possibilities leading  to such variant of Bartter's syndrome.  ,  Context: supplementation was only slighty decreased and hypercalciuric response to  furosemide administration was not observed. Supplementation with magnesium  chloride failed to correct hypomagnesemia while potassium chloride improved  hypokalemia.

In fact, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play"," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,"Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single pill, known as Avandamet."," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a  ,  Context: formulation (vehicle) without antiphlogistic ingredients was used. First, the  SPF of the sunscreen formulas with and without antiphlogistic ingredients was  analyzed in vitro. To investigate whether the antiphlogistic ingredient may  suppress the inflammatory response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the SPF was  determined in vivo. Finally, selected formulations were also analyzed in an  erythema model for testing formulations on UV-induced inflammation.  RESULTS: It could be confirmed that no differences between the formula with and  that without the active antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol exist  when measured in vitro. However, there was also no statistically significant difference in the erythemal response between the vehicle (without an  antiphlogistic active ingredient) and the test formulations with different  concentrations of the antiphlogistic active ingredients in the in vivo determination of the SPF.

STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory  elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.  We propose ExSpeU1s as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct, in several human disorders, different types of splicing mutations associated with defective exon  definition.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show  that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217,  including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed  ,  Context: CaP and 2 cell lines. Micro RNAs were isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation  kit and cDNA was obtained using the TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription kit to  the miRNAs: hsa-miR-let7c, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-25,  hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-191,  hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-218. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out  using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master  Mix. miRNA expression levels were measured by relative quantification, and fold  expression changes were determined by the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. The small nucleolar  RNA RNU43 was used as an endogenous control. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs  significantly changed during the progression of CaP. Interestingly, there was a  significant global loss of miRNA expression between HGPIN and metastasis at 2 important steps. The first was related to the transition from HGPIN to invasive  adenocarcinoma, and the second was related to the transition from localized to  metastatic adenocarcinomas.  ,  Context: nuclear bodies including Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs). GEMs contribute to the  biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA), a component of splicing  machinery. The number of GEMs and a subset of U snRNAs decrease in spinal  muscular atrophy, a lower motor neuron disease, suggesting that alteration of U  snRNAs may also underlie the molecular pathogenesis of ALS. Here, we  investigated the number of GEMs and U11/12-type small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  (snRNP) by immunohistochemistry and the level of U snRNAs using real-time  quantitative RT-PCR in ALS tissues. GEMs decreased in both TDP-43-depleted HeLa  cells and spinal motor neurons in ALS patients. Levels of several U snRNAs decreased in TDP-43-depleted SH-SY5Y and U87-MG cells. The level of U12 snRNA  was decreased in tissues affected by ALS (spinal cord, motor cortex and  thalamus) but not in tissues unaffected by ALS (cerebellum, kidney and muscle). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the decrease in U11/12-type snRNP in  spinal motor neurons of ALS patients. These findings suggest that loss of TDP-43  function decreases the number of GEMs, which is followed by a disturbance of  ","19219028, 22362925, 22454067, 3299107, 21880514, 23740936","Until now, two main types of therapeutic strategies have been developed using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA): 1) Production of a defective, but partially functional protein, with the help of exon skipping, through modulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and 2) Correction of pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations with the use of U1 snRNA adapted to the defective variant.","22968481, 21326217, 20869034, 22362925, 21520335, 22454066, 22454067, 19219028"
When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class  treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This  also included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species  excreted in urine. Volanesorsen is highly bound to plasma proteins that are similar in mice, monkeys, and humans. In all species, plasma concentrations  declined in a multiphasic fashion, characterized by a relatively fast initial  distribution phase and then a much slower terminal elimination phase following  ,  Context: risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased  risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.  ,  Context: have resulted in vaccine programs for severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, some individuals remain at high risk for  the progression of COVID-19. In the US, the FDA has given Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA) for two neutralizing therapeutic monoclonal antibody  'cocktails,' casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV), bamlanivimab and etesevimab,  and one monotherapy, bamlanivimab, for prophylactic post-exposure therapy in  individuals at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Preclinical and  clinical studies showed consistent effectiveness of REGEN-COV against current  variants of SARS-CoV-2. On 21st November 2020, the FDA approved an initial EUA for REGEN-COV to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and in children 12  years or older with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at high risk for progression to  severe COVID-19. On 30th July 2021, the FDA updated its EUA for REGEN-COV for emergency use as post-exposure prophylactic to prevent COVID-19 progression in  adults and children aged 12 years or older.

Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical  studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as  a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on  patients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey  open to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for ≥3 months in an  open-label extension study. The survey included questions about patients'  experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of  222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from  baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry  about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school  responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social,  and professional life were also reported.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) was detected in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined, and GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was expressed in nine of 14 NSCLC cell"," Context: localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP  levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine  or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions  of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography  (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of  seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were  produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were  produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were  equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR  and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed  A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium.  Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and  ,  Context:  HER-2/neu is overexpressed in most epithelial malignancies. Lung cancer,  prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer are common epithelial tumors in which  clinical trials are currently in progress to explore the potential therapeutic role for monoclonal antibodies to HER-2/neu (trastuzumab [Herceptin; Genentech,  Inc, South San Francisco, CA]). In preclinical studies with tumor cell lines,  trastuzumab was found to have additive and synergistic effects with some chemotherapeutic agents. Clinical trials investigating combination chemotherapy  with trastuzumab and a variety of chemotherapeutic agents are already in  progress in lung cancer.  ,  Context:  Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists. PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to  ,  Context: ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it  has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that  PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and is  essential for proper GCase activity. GCase activity is significantly reduced in  tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced  lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of  GRN-related FTLD and NCL.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral  parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine  content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ","7723058, 3357886, 1556753, 8411203","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life.

Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified.

We aimed to investigate the frequency of  disease-causing heterozygous GDAP1 mutations in ADCMT and their associated  phenotype. METHODS: We performed mutation analysis in a large cohort of ADCMT patients by means of bidirectional sequencing of coding regions and exon-intron boundaries  of GDAP1. Intragenic GDAP1 deletions were excluded using an allele  quantification assay. We confirmed the pathogenic character of one sequence variant by in vitro experiments assaying mitochondrial morphology and function.

Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to provide iodine to the population for different purposes, including protecting against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes during accidents with nuclear reactors."," Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid.

METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness  to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation  with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg  twice daily).

Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

METHODS: Balb/c mice were given drinking water containing different levels of  iodine for 1 month and treated with 1.2 microg/mL iodine for different periods of time, respectively. Plasma lipid parameters and serum thyroid hormones were  measured.

What are 5 key questions in human performance modeling?,1) Why we build models of human performance;  2) What the expectations of a good human performance model are;  3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are;  4) How we integrate a human," Context: Via building computational (typically mathematical and computer simulation)  models, human performance modeling (HPM) quantifies, predicts, and maximizes  human performance, human-machine system productivity and safety. This paper  describes and summarizes the five key questions of human performance modeling:  1) Why we build models of human performance; 2) What the expectations of a good  human performance model are; 3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are; 4) How we integrate a human  performance model with system design; and 5) What the possible future directions  of human performance modeling research are. Recent and classic HPM findings are addressed in the five questions to provide new thinking in HPM's motivations,  expectations, procedures, system integration and future directions.  ,  Context: contagion diffusion problem. Two specific problems, computational epidemiology  and human immune system modeling, are given as examples. We then show how the  graphics processing unit (GPU) within each compute node of a cluster can  effectively be used to speed-up the execution of these types of problems. RESULTS: We show that a single GPU can accelerate the EpiSimdemics computation  kernel by a factor of 6 and the entire application by a factor of 3.3, compared  to the execution time on a single core. When 8 CPU cores and 2 GPU devices are  utilized, the speed-up of the computational kernel increases to 9.5. When  combined with effective techniques for inter-node communication, excellent scalability can be achieved without significant loss of accuracy in the results. CONCLUSIONS: We show that interaction-based simulation systems can be used to  model disparate and highly relevant problems in biology. We also show that offloading some of the work to GPUs in distributed interaction-based simulations  can be an effective way to achieve increased intra-node efficiency.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Combinatorial complexity is a central problem when modeling  biochemical reaction networks, since the association of a few components can  give rise to a large variation of protein complexes. Available classical modeling approaches are often insufficient for the analysis of very large and  complex networks in detail. Recently, we developed a new rule-based modeling  approach that facilitates the analysis of spatial and combinatorially complex problems. Here, we explore for the first time how this approach can be applied  to a specific biological system, the human kinetochore, which is a multi-protein  complex involving over 100 proteins.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Past and repeated self-harm are long-term risks to completed  suicide. A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is  important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide  prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS  Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. METHODS: One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from  the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The  controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in  the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements  that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and  applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An  open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital  inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content  analysis.  ,  Context: About 5000 (25%) of the ~20400 human protein-coding genes currently lack any  experimental evidence at the protein level. For many others, there is only  little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular  localization, interactions, or cellular functions. The aim of the HUPO Human  Proteome Project (HPP, www.thehpp.org ) is to collect this information for every  human protein. HPP is based on three major pillars: mass spectrometry (MS), antibody/affinity capture reagents (Ab), and bioinformatics-driven knowledge  base (KB). To meet this objective, the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project  (C-HPP) proposes to build this catalog chromosome-by-chromosome ( www.c-hpp.org ) by focusing primarily on proteins that currently lack MS evidence or Ab  detection. These are termed ""missing proteins"" by the HPP consortium. The lack  of observation of a protein can be due to various factors including incorrect  ,  Context: the histologic parameters of inflammation and injury, we quantitated these  characteristics in infected and uninfected persons. METHODS: Fifty patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and biopsy  specimens were taken. Apoptotic cells in the specimens were quantitated after  terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling of DNA fragments with  digoxigenin-deoxyuridine triphosphate; epithelial cell proliferation was scored  by immunohistochemical analysis of the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67.  Antibodies directed against H. pylori and CagA protein were measured in the  serum of patients by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Analysis of H. pylori genomic DNA, by use of the polymerase chain reaction, was performed to  determine the cagA and vacA genotypes. Acute and chronic inflammation,  epithelial cell degeneration, mucin depletion, intestinal metaplasia, glandular atrophy, and vacuolation were each scored in a blinded manner.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause Usher syndrome type 2C.," Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: and dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas other mutations cause in addition skeletal  muscle myopathy. Dystrophin mutations are the cause of the rare X-linked dilated  cardiomyopathy without skeletal muscle involvement and a progressive course in  young men. Other mutations in the dystrophin gene, mainly deletions, are the  cause of the muscular dystrophy Becker and Duchenne which also present with  dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutations of the desmin, delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac  actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to  cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. The  infantile X-linked DCM is caused by mutations of the tafazzin gene. The onset of the disease is typically within the first year of life and death occurs usually  in childhood. Most patients may in addition be characterized by skeletal  myopathy, short stature, neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria, also referred to as Barth syndrome. Knowledge of the DCM disease genes led to the new hypothesis  that dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial force generation or  force transmission. Many more disease loci are known but the responsible disease  ,  Context: Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative  disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant  number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named  HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype.  Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and  junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the  mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other  gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of  HD.  ,  Context: The inherited metabolic disease propionic acidemia (PA) can result from  mutations in either of the genes PCCA or PCCB, which encode the alpha and beta  subunits, respectively, of the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl CoA-carboxylase.  In this work we have analyzed the molecular basis of PCCA gene defects, studying  mRNA levels and identifying putative disease causing mutations. A total of 10  different mutations, none predominant, are present in a sample of 24 mutant alleles studied. Five novel mutations are reported here for the first time. A  neutral polymorphism and a variant allele present in the general population were  also detected. To examine the effect of a point mutation (M348K) involving a highly conserved residue, we have carried out in vitro expression of normal and  mutant PCCA cDNA and analyzed the mitochondrial import and stability of the  resulting proteins. Both wild-type and mutant proteins were imported into  ","30394532, 25186273, 22499950, 11515275, 15764008, 10101253","Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with progressive microcephaly, seizures, and joint anomalies.",34244665
List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex contains subunits Med220 and Med70, among others."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin  family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute  inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker  of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that  CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a  native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury  it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells  and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric  subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both  classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q  and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte  recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T  cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: the TATA binding protein-associated factors to promote efficient activation of  transcription by Sp1. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that  are shared with other cofactor complexes. Here, we report a detailed  purification protocol for the isolation of CRSP from human HeLa cells. Our  purification strategy takes advantage of the ability of CRSP to bind  Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin as well as other conventional  chromatographic resins. We also describe a streamlined purification protocol  that allows a more rapid and efficient means to isolate active CRSP.  ,  Context: from mouse Flag-CSN2 B8 fibroblasts. In an in vitro deneddylation assay both the  human and the mouse CSN complexes deneddylated Nedd8-Cul1 with comparable rates.  3D structural models of the erythrocyte CSN as well as of the mouse Flag-CSN  were generated by negative stain EM and by cryo-EM. Both complexes show a  central U-shaped segment from which several arms emanate. This structure, called  the horseshoe, is formed by the PCI domain subunits. CSN5 and CSN6 point away  from the horseshoe. Compared to 3D models of negatively stained CSN complexes,  densities assigned to CSN2 and CSN4 are better defined in the cryo-map. Because  biochemical and structural results obtained with CSN complexes isolated from human erythrocytes and purified by Flag-CSN pulldown from mouse B8 fibroblasts  are very similar, Flag-CSN pulldowns are a proper alternative to CSN preparation  from erythrocytes.  ,  Context: resolution of all protein charge states. We achieved absolute mass accuracies  for intact proteins between 0.92 and 2.8 ppm using the ""lock mass"" mode of  operation. Fifty femtomole of cytochrome c applied to the chip resulted in  spectra with excellent signal-to-noise ratio and only low attomole sample  consumption. Different protein charge states were dissociated in the LTQ, and  the sensitivity of the orbitrap allowed routine, high resolution, and high mass  accuracy fragment detection. This resulted in unambiguous charge state  determination of fragment ions and identification of unmodified and modified  proteins by database searching. Protein fragments were further isolated and fragmented in the LTQ followed by analysis of MS(3) fragments in the orbitrap,  localizing modifications to part of the sequence and helping to identify the  protein with these small peptide-like fragments. Given the ready availability and ease of operation of the LTQ-Orbitrap, it may have significant impact on  top-down proteomics.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is demonstrated by studies on Staphylococcus aureus, which show that EVs can be purified from this strain and internalized into human macrophages"," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive, obligate anaerobic rod, is an emerging  periodontal pathogen that is frequently isolated from patients with  periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and apical periodontitis. Recent studies have  shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal  pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector  molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and  characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their  immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density  gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission  electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270 nm in  ,  Context: fluorophore-HD5 conjugate family. By employing these peptides, we demonstrate  that fluorophore-HD5ox conjugates harboring the rhodamine and coumarin  fluorophores enter the E. coli cytoplasm. On the basis of the fluorescence  profiles, each of these fluorophore-HD5ox conjugates localizes to the site of  cell division and cell poles. These studies support the notion that HD5ox, at  least in part, exerts its antibacterial activity against E. coli and other  Gram-negative microbes in the cytoplasm.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically AMPK-α2 isoform promotes SG association."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context: Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins  that form when translation initiation is inhibited. Stress granules are thought  to form by protein-protein interactions of RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate  RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ","18775331, 25840010, 29129640, 17762881, 29483269, 22727621",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is involved in regulating its activity and specificity toward mRNAs through interaction with associated kinases that act as coactivators. Additionally, it plays a role in 3'-end processing of mRNA."," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: the associated Type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that synthesizes  PI4,5P2 as well as protein kinases. These associated kinases act as coactivators  of Star-PAP that regulates its activity and specificity toward mRNAs, yet the  mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a  phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the  domain required for PIPKIα interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by  CKIα within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and  interaction with PIPKIα. Unlike the CKIα mediated phosphorylation at the  catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKIα activity. S6 phosphorylation  together with coactivator PIPKIα controlled select subset of Star-PAP target  messages by regulating Star-PAP-mRNA association. Our results establish a novel role for phosphorylation in determining Star-PAP target mRNA specificity and  regulation of 3'-end processing.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: In testis mRNA stability and translation initiation are extensively under the  control of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP). Here we have cloned a new human  testis-specific PABP (PABP3) of 631 amino acids (70.1 kDa) with 92.5% identical  residues to the ubiquitous PABP1. A northern blot of multiple human tissues  hybridised with PABP3- and PABP1-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed two  PABP3 mRNAs (2.1 and 2.5 kb) detected only in testis, whereas PABP1 mRNA (3.2 kb) was present in all tested tissues. In human adult testis, PABP3 mRNA  expression was restricted to round spermatids, whereas PABP1 was expressed in  these cells as well as in pachytene spermatocytes. PABP3-specific antibodies identified a protein of 70 kDa in human testis extracts. This protein binds  poly(A) with a slightly lower affinity as compared to PABP1. The human PABP3  gene is intronless with a transcription start site 61 nt upstream from the  ,  Context: breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages.  It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able  to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond  immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in  clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area  of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues  remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of  exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of  other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their  mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter  issue.  ,  Context: induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian  target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively  regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2  functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the  high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of  lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin  family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an  example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector  proteins.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,Defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.," Context: addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  and the prominent roles of Ihh in coordinating skeletogenesis, genetic ablation  of Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired  Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast  differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures. Our data  demonstrate that Scube2 plays a key regulatory role in Ihh-dependent  endochondral bone formation.  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: IMPORTANCE: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is usually sporadic, but few  pedigrees with familial clustering of PSP-like phenotypes have been described.  Occasionally, MAPT, C9ORF72, and TARDBP mutations have been identified.  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the DCTN1 gene in 19 families with a clinical phenotype of  PSP (PSP-like phenotype). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sequencing of the DCTN1 gene in familial forms of PSP at a referral center among 21 patients with familial PSP-like  phenotypes. In addition, 8 patients and relatives from a family carrying a DCTN1  mutation were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of the DCTN1 mutation and clinical  description of DCTN1 mutation carriers. RESULTS: We identified a DCTN1 mutation in a large family characterized by high  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac arrhythmia that may lead to  sudden death in patients with structurally normal heart. Mutations in the alpha  subunit of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A gene are found in approximately 20%  of cases. We clinically evaluated and genetically screened 7 patients that fully  satisfied the clinical diagnostic criteria for the syndrome and 8 patients with  a partial clinical diagnosis, for mutations in the SCN5A gene in order to explore the genetic status of BrS patients from Greece for whom there are no  published data available. Genetic testing was positive in 3 out of the 7  patients with a definite diagnosis. The probands carried 1 nonsense (p.Trp301X) and 2 missense (p.Ala1949Pro and p.Arg808Cys) mutations.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have failed to," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis. There are still  concerns about the long term safety of TNF antagonists in the pediatric age  group and unanswered questions about increased risks of malignancy and  ,  Context: patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those  analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering  orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive  effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is  granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan  drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient  for the treatment of a common indication.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Through binding to folate receptor-β (FR-β), the new (99m)Tc-EC20  (Etarfolatide) imaging technique detects activated but not resting macrophages  in vivo. The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related  inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole  body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored  blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain  severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and employed repeated measures to adjust for correlation between knees. DESIGN: Activated macrophages were present in the majority (76%) of knees. The  quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including  joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66,  P = 0.001). Macrophages were also localized to joints commonly affected by OA  ,  Context: difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with  GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome  of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those  with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI  patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone  could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug.

We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease, also known as Batten disease."," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections. (Funded by BioMarin Pharmaceutical and others; CLN2 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01907087 and  NCT02485899 .).  ,  Context: Treatment with intracerebroventricular (ICV)-delivered cerliponase alfa enzyme  replacement therapy (ERT) in a Phase 1/2 study of 24 subjects with CLN2 disease  resulted in a meaningful preservation of motor and language (ML) function and  was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context:  Deficiency of acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) causes Pompe disease, which is  usually fatal if onset occurs in infancy. Patients synthesize a non-functional  form of GAA or are unable to form native enzyme. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) prolongs survival in infantile Pompe patients but  may be less effective in cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative  patients. We retrospectively analyzed the influence of CRIM status on outcome in 21 CRIM-positive and 11 CRIM-negative infantile Pompe patients receiving rhGAA.  Patients were from the clinical setting and from clinical trials of rhGAA, were  6 months of age, were not invasively ventilated, and were treated with IV rhGAA  ,  Context: substrate, glucocerebroside. Accumulation of glucocerebroside substrate in  macrophages, as a result of loss of enzyme function, leads to the formation of  Gaucher cells causing hypertrophy of the spleen and liver, hematological  disorders, skeletal malformations and the neurological symptoms characteristic  of Gaucher's disease. The disease is subdivided into three types that differ in  their symptoms, severity and prognosis. Patients of any age can be affected but  those of a younger age have a poor prognosis often dying in infancy. As a  genetic disorder the incidence of the disease is variable on a global scale.  Enzyme replacement therapy is the therapy of choice and has demonstrated good efficacy in treating the visceral and skeletal symptoms of Gaucher's disease. A  cost-effective plant-cell-derived human recombinant glucocerebrosidase,  taliglucerase alfa, has been developed that demonstrated a promising safety and efficacy profile in phase I clinical trials and is currently in phase III and IV  trials for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with Gaucher's disease.  ,  Context: Rat-bite fever is an uncommon bacterial illness resulting from infection with  Streptobacillus moniliformis that is often transmitted by the bite of a rat.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"Blood vessels and cartilage have been successfully fabricated using 3D bioprinting technology. Additionally, zigzag tubes and tubular channels encapsulating cells in alginate to mimic the natural vascular system have also been printed."," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically  ,  Context: Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is  driving major innovations in many areas, such as engineering, manufacturing,  art, education and medicine. Recent advances have enabled 3D printing of  biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has  ,  Context: The capability to print three-dimensional (3D) cellular tubes is not only a  logical first step towards successful organ printing but also a critical  indicator of the feasibility of the envisioned organ printing technology. A  platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with  an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed  bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular  tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even  after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good droplet formation, indicating the promising application of the proposed  bioprinting system. Particularly, it is proved that the tubular overhang  structure can be scaffold-free fabricated using inkjetting, and the maximum achievable height depends on the inclination angle of the overhang structure. As  a proof-of-concept study, the resulting fabrication knowledge helps print  tissue-engineered blood vessels with complex geometry.  ,  Context:  Organ printing is a novel concept recently introduced in developing artificial  three-dimensional organs to bridge the gap between transplantation needs and  organ shortage. One of the major challenges is inclusion of blood-vessellike channels between layers to support cell viability, postprinting functionality in  terms of nutrient transport, and waste removal. In this research, we developed a  novel and effective method to print tubular channels encapsulating cells in alginate to mimic the natural vascular system. An experimental investigation  into the influence on cartilage progenitor cell (CPCs) survival, and the  function of printing parameters during and after the printing process were  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context: subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6,  SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol  metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by  regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  ,  Context: Gene redundancy has been observed in yeast, plant and human genomes, and is  thought to be a consequence of whole-genome duplications. Baker's yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains several hundred duplicated genes.  Duplication(s) could have occurred before or after a given speciation. To  understand the evolution of the yeast genome, we analysed orthologues of some of  these genes in several related yeast species. On the basis of the inferred phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene  duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast  lineages. Here we show that the gene duplications might have occurred as a single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and  Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are laryngeal cancer cells.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only  inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: Quiescent endothelial cells contain low concentrations of plasminogen activator  inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2). However, its synthesis can be rapidly stimulated by a  variety of inflammatory mediators. In this study, we provide evidence that PAI-2  interacts with proteasome and affects its activity in endothelial cells. To  ensure that the PAI-2·proteasome complex is formed in vivo, both proteins were  coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cells and identified with specific  antibodies. The specificity of this interaction was evidenced after (a)  transfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-2 and coimmunoprecipitation of both  proteins with anti-PAI-2 antibodies and (b) silencing of the PAI-2 gene using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Subsequently, cellular distribution of  the PAI-2·proteasome complexes was established by immunogold staining and  electron microscopy analyses. As judged by confocal microscopy, both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but they also could be found in a dense  perinuclear and nuclear location. PAI-2 was not polyubiquitinated, suggesting  that it bound to proteasome not as the substrate but rather as its inhibitor.  ,  Context: screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes,  RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, RPS10,  RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3,  RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A,  RPS2, and RPL38, in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. We identified three  distinct mutations of RPS10 in five probands and nine distinct mutations of  RPS26 in 12 probands. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients  bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA.  This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that  mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of  the proteins in rRNA processing.  ,  Context: Intramembranous ""gamma-secretase"" processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein  (APP) and other transmembrane proteins, including Notch, is mediated by a  macromolecular complex consisting of presenilins (PSs), nicastrin (NCT), APH-1,  and PEN-2. We now demonstrate that in cells coexpressing PS1, APH-1, and NCT,  full-length PS1 accumulates to high levels and is fairly stable. Upon expression  of PEN-2, the levels of PS1 holoprotein are significantly reduced, commensurate  with an elevation in levels of PS1 fragments. These findings suggest that APH-1  and NCT are necessary for stabilization of full-length PS1 and that PEN-2 is  critical for the proteolysis of stabilized PS1. In N2a and 293 cell lines that stably overexpress PS1, APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2, PS1 fragment levels are elevated  by up to 10-fold over endogenous levels. In these cells, we find a marked  accumulation of the APP-CTF gamma (AICD) fragment and a concomitant reduction in levels of both APP-CTF beta and CTF alpha. Moreover, the production of the  gamma-secretase-generated Notch S3/NICD derivative is modestly elevated.  However, we failed to observe a corresponding increase in levels of secreted A  ","25658113, 24477342, 11093143, 21976669, 20116044, 12821663",human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2),"32409089, 30702281, 32384969, 25658113"
Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is a complication associated with dental implant placement, particularly when the Schneiderian membrane is perforated during the procedure."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N.

The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  RESULTS: Eight studies provided information on the survival rate, with a global  sample of 493 implants, being the weighted mean survival rate 95.6% (IC 95%),  after 52.7 months of follow-up. The level of implant penetration (≤ 4 mm or > 4 mm) did not report statistically significant differences in survival rate  (p = 0.403). Seven studies provided information on the rate of clinical  complications, being the mean complication rate 3.4% (IC 95%). The most frequent clinical complication was epistaxis, without finding significant differences  according to the level of penetration. Five studies provide information on the  radiographic complication; the most common complication was thickening of the  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth,  accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small  percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases.  Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body  tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and  bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration.  Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying  dental implant failure. PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs, representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (p < .05).  ,  Context: comminution had not been recognised and bone grafting was not performed. The  patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation  and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel  release at 8 months. One patient had implant-related extensor digitorum communis  irritation. Another patient had non-specific chronic wrist pain, which was  resolved at one year. No patient had infection, tendon rupture, or complex  regional pain syndrome. Four patients underwent implant removal, including 2 who  had no implant-related problems. CONCLUSION: Combined volar and dorsal plating enables early mobilisation and good outcome for certain complex comminuted distal radial fractures.  ,  Context: median age, 56 years). A cohort group of 45 patients undergoing surgery for  recurrent glioblastoma during the same time period, but not receiving wafers,  was identified. Surgery was performed at a median 47 weeks from diagnosis (14  women, 31 men; median age, 54 years). RESULTS: Within 6 weeks of surgery, 13 complications were identified in 8  patients in the wafer group. In the cohort group, 6 patients sustained 8  complications. We were unable to identify any survival advantage using  Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the wafer group, median survival was 58 weeks from  diagnosis and 14 weeks from wafer implantation. In the cohort group, median survival was 97 weeks from diagnosis and 50 weeks from operation. CONCLUSION: 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-Nitrosourea wafer implantation for  recurrent glioblastoma was associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications, particularly those related to infection and wound healing. No  clear survival benefit associated with wafer implantation was identified.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, there is no indication in the provided information that AGY can be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy. The text only mentions AGY as a novel treatment to neutralize gluten and improve the efficacy of a gluten-free diet for patients with"," Context: BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder of the  small intestine. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved  treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from  inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a  novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in  patients with CD.  METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female).  ,  Context: Type 2 diabetes is characterized by decreased insulin secretion and sensitivity.  The available oral anti-diabetic drugs act on many different molecular sites.  The most used of oral anti-diabetic agents is metformin that activates glucose  transport vesicles to the cell surface. Others are: the sulphonylureas; agents  acting on the incretin system; GLP-1 agonists; dipetidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors;  meglinitide analogues; and the thiazolidinediones. Despite these many drugs  acting by different mechanisms, glycaemic control often remains elusive. None of  these drugs have a primary renal mechanism of action on the kidneys, where  almost all glucose excreted is normally reabsorbed. That is where the inhibitors of glucose reuptake (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, SGLT2) have a unique site  of action. Promotion of urinary loss of glucose by SGLT2 inhibitors embodies a  new principle of control in type 2 diabetes that has several advantages with some urogenital side-effects, both of which are evaluated in this review.  Specific approvals include use as monotherapy, when diet and exercise alone do  not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use of metformin  ,  Context: reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and  they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other  oral glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors  declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing  information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage  adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is  also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal  impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of  hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and  will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with  cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve  more attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most  frequently reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while  ,  Context: Sotagliflozin is the first dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor developed for use in  diabetes. Sotagliflozin blocks SGLT2 in the kidneys and SGLT1 in the intestines  resulting in reduced early phase glucose absorption and increased blood levels  of GLP-1 and PYY. Urinary glucose excretion is lower than with other agents as a  result of decreased glucose absorption. The primary development effort to date  has been in Type 1 diabetes. Areas covered: The published information on sotagliflozin is reviewed, along with the recent results of several pivotal Type  1 diabetes trials. Expert opinion: Sotagliflozin treatment lowers HbA1c and  reduces glucose variability, with a trend to less hypoglycemic events. In the Type 1 trials, sotagliflozin treated individuals experienced DKA at a higher  rate than placebo treated patients. An additional safety issue arises from the  as yet unknown potential risks in women of child bearing potential in whom DKA  ","28035551, 24825435, 25488697, 29212386","No, AGY is an oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody used to neutralize gluten.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat prostate cancer and endometriosis-associated pain, as well as symptoms related to uterine myomas (benign gynecological tumors)."," Context: 25-item EORTC prostate cancer module [EORTC QLQ-PR25]) questionnaires, and  safety. No formal statistical comparisons with degarelix were planned. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with  relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds,  respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During  treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three  months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well  tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose  of this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2  inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms ""SGLT2"" and ""SGLT2  inhibitor"" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes.

Randomized controlled trials incorporating acupotomy versus  intra-articular sodium hyaluronate for knee osteoarthritis were included.  According to Cochrane Reviews' Handbook (5.2), two reviewers screened each  article and extracted data independently and were blinded to the findings of  each reviewer. Meta-analysis was performed by the Cochrane Collaboration's  RevMan 5.3 software.  RESULTS: We identified 12 studies involving 1150 patients aged between 40 and 78  years old. The pooled analysis indicated that acupotomy showed a significant  improvement for short-term effect [cure rate: odds ratio (OR) = 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.46, 2.85), P < 0.01; total effective rate: OR =  2.25, 95% CI (1.55, 3.28), P < 0.01; pain score: standard mean difference (SMD)  = －1.02; 95% CI (－1.72, －0.31); P = 0.005; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Questionnaire (WOMAC) score: SMD = －0.74; 95% CI (－1.11, －0.37); P  < 0.01]; and also for long-term effect [total effective rate: OR = 2.99, 95%CI  (1.88, 4.76), Z = 4.64, P < 0.01; pain score: SMD = －1.68; 95% CI (－2.14,  ,  Context: exosome formation, the makeup of the cargo, biological pathways, and resulting  functions are incompletely understood. One of their most intriguing roles is  intercellular communication--exosomes function as the messengers, delivering  various effector or signaling macromolecules between specific cells. There is an  exponentially growing need to dissect structure and the function of exosomes and  utilize them for development of minimally invasive diagnostics and therapeutics.  Critical to further our understanding of exosomes is the development of  reagents, tools, and protocols for their isolation, characterization, and  analysis of their RNA and protein contents. Here we describe a complete exosome workflow solution, starting from fast and efficient extraction of exosomes from  cell culture media and serum to isolation of RNA followed by characterization of  exosomal RNA content using qRT-PCR and next-generation sequencing techniques. Effectiveness of this workflow is exemplified by analysis of the RNA content of  exosomes derived from HeLa cell culture media and human serum, using Ion Torrent  PGM as a sequencing platform.  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is a rapidly emerging field aimed to analyze microbial  diversity and dynamics by studying the genomic content of the microbiota.  Metataxonomics tools analyze high-throughput sequencing data, primarily from 16S  rRNA gene sequencing and DNAseq, to identify microorganisms and viruses within a  complex mixture. With the growing demand for analysis of the functional  microbiome, metatranscriptome studies attract more interest. To make  metatranscriptomic data sufficient for metataxonomics, new analytical workflows  are needed to deal with sparse and taxonomically less informative sequencing  data. RESULTS: We present a new protocol, IMSA+A, for accurate taxonomy classification based on metatranscriptome data of any read length that can efficiently and  robustly identify bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the same sample. The new  protocol improves accuracy by using a conservative reference database, employing a new counting scheme, and by assembling shotgun reads. Assembly also reduces  analysis runtime.

We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments.

Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The exponential growth of available biological data has caused  bioinformatics to be rapidly moving towards a data-intensive, computational  science. As a result, the computational power needed by bioinformatics  applications is growing exponentially as well. The recent emergence of  accelerator technologies has made it possible to achieve an excellent  improvement in execution time for many bioinformatics applications, compared to current general-purpose platforms. In this paper, we demonstrate how the  PlayStation 3, powered by the Cell Broadband Engine, can be used as a  computational platform to accelerate the Smith-Waterman algorithm. RESULTS: For large datasets, our implementation on the PlayStation 3 provides a  significant improvement in running time compared to other implementations such  as SSEARCH, Striped Smith-Waterman and CUDA. Our implementation achieves a peak  ,  Context: studies is rather low suggest that aligning (parts of) those reads with a single  gap is in fact desirable. RESULTS: In this article, we present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise  short-read alignments. Apart from the standard CPU version, it includes  ultrafast SSE- and GPU-based implementations. libgapmis is based on an algorithm  computing a modified version of the traditional dynamic-programming matrix for  sequence alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the  functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the  computations by a factor of 20 compared to other programmes. The analogous SSE- and GPU-based implementations accelerate the computations by a factor of 6 and  11, respectively, compared to the CPU version. The library also provides the  user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a  variable, but bounded, number of gaps in the alignment. CONCLUSIONS: We present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise short-read  ,  Context: e.g., new protein sequences are compared with a set of HMMs to detect functional  similarities. Efficient dynamic-programming algorithms exist for solving this  problem; however, current solutions still require significant scan times. These  scan time requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid  growth in the size of these databases. This paper shows how reconfigurable  architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of  the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to  significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard  off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

RESULTS: We found no consistent pattern of prenatal biochemical markers or other  prenatal characteristics. Nevertheless, increased NT, low PAPP-A and ultrasound  features such as intra uterine growth restriction, posterior fossa, cardiac and  bowel abnormalities may be helpful in raising the suspicion for this rare  genetic syndrome.  CONCLUSION: Review of the biochemical screening results, ultrasound findings,  and demographic characteristics of this Emanuel syndrome case series, as well as  of the relevant literature fail to suggest a characteristic prenatal pattern.  ,  Context: Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with  severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West  syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and  nonsyndromic epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we  identified a novel single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT  (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of the STXBP1 gene.

Timothy syndrome is a human genetic  disorder due to mutations in the Ca(V)1.2 gene. Here, we explored whether  perturbation of the I-II linker helical structure might provide a mechanistic  explanation for a Timothy syndrome mutant's (human Ca(V)1.2 G406R equivalent)  biophysical effects on inactivation and activation. The results are equivocal,  suggesting that a full mechanistic explanation for this Timothy syndrome  mutation requires further investigation.  ,  Context: The small molecule drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) specifically targets cardiac  muscle myosin and is known to enhance cardiac muscle performance, yet its impact  on human cardiac myosin motor function is unclear. We expressed and purified  human β-cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (M2β-S1) containing a C-terminal Avi tag.  We demonstrate that the maximum actin-activated ATPase activity of M2β-S1 is  slowed more than 4-fold in the presence of OM, whereas the actin concentration  required for half-maximal ATPase was reduced dramatically (30-fold). We find OM  does not change the overall actin affinity. Transient kinetic experiments  suggest that there are two kinetic pathways in the presence of OM. The dominant pathway results in a slow transition between actomyosin·ADP states and increases  the time myosin is strongly bound to actin. However, OM also traps a population  of myosin heads in a weak actin affinity state with slow product release. We demonstrate that OM can reduce the actin sliding velocity more than 100-fold in  the in vitro motility assay. The ionic strength dependence of in vitro motility  suggests the inhibition may be at least partially due to drag forces from weakly  ","22434056, 22596016, 16760737, 29761466, 22990809, 28082673","OligoSTORM and OligoDNA-PAINT meld the Oligopaint technology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with, respectively, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) and DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) to enable in situ single-molecule super-resolution imaging of nucleic acids.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,"CYP3A4 is the most active enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of pyrotinib. However, it is not possible to determine which CYP450 enzyme is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available"," Context: focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: still an issue that requires systematic and comparative studies. Therefore, a  benchmark study about the vocabularies, representations and ranking algorithms  in gene prioritization by text mining is discussed in this article.  RESULTS: We investigated 5 different domain vocabularies, 2 text representation  schemes and 27 linear ranking algorithms for disease gene prioritization by text  mining. We indexed 288 177 MEDLINE titles and abstracts with the TXTGate text  pro.ling system and adapted the benchmark dataset of the Endeavour gene  prioritization system that consists of 618 disease-causing genes. Textual gene  pro.les were created and their performance for prioritization were evaluated and discussed in a comparative manner. The results show that inverse document  frequency-based representation of gene term vectors performs better than the  term-frequency inverse document-frequency representation. The eVOC and MESH domain vocabularies perform better than Gene Ontology, Online Mendelian  Inheritance in Man's and London Dysmorphology Database. The ranking algorithms  based on 1-SVM, Standard Correlation and Ward linkage method provide the best  performance.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: metabolism and distribution are not appreciably affected by altered function of  cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or permeability glycoprotein (P-gp).  Desvenlafaxine has clinically insignificant effects on the activity of CYP and  P-gp. The efficacy of desvenlafaxine in treating major depressive disorder has  been established. Adverse events are characteristic of the SNRI class. Notably,  the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events with the 50 mg/day recommended  therapeutic dose is comparable to that seen with placebo. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: incremental benefits with desvenlafaxine, derived from  straight-forward dosing, a simple metabolic profile and lack of interaction with active transporter P-gp and CYP enzymes may contribute to more consistent  response, good tolerability and lower incidence of drug-drug interactions with  concomitant medications.  ,  Context: demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding.  Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the  dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic  metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good  interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral  factor Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible  and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: identified, including 16 phase I metabolites resulting from dealkylation,  oxidation, dehydrogenation, and carbonylation, and 8 phase II metabolites  originating from cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugation. Pyrotinib was  absorbed into blood by 1h, reached its peak level at 4h, and afterwards  underwent slow elimination. The principal metabolites detected in humans (M1,  M2, and M5) were products resulting from O-depicoline and pyrrolidine lactam  formation, whose structures have been confirmed by the synthetic references. In  addition, fecal clearance was the major route of excretion for pyrotinib.  Further phenotyping experiment proved that CYP3A4 was the most active enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of pyrotinib, implying the vital necessity  of the assessment of the potential CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in  humans.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. In fibroblasts, it maintains a ""young cell"" phenotype, regulates cell growth, and is involved in the implementation of the sen"," Context: Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human  fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. We therefore postulated that AMPK  activation in human fibroblasts might contribute to the implementation of the  senescence phenotype through mechanisms that included a reduction in HuR  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic  overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine  HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context: The ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) or ELAVL1 is  implicated in a variety of biological processes as well as being linked with a  number of diseases, including cancer. Despite a great deal of prior  investigation into HuR, there is still much to learn about its function. We take  an important step in this direction by conducting cross-linking and  immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing experiments followed by an extensive computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site  and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly  uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong conservation of structure and sequence composition. Despite the fact that HuR  sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR  in regulating splicing. HuR sites in 3'-UTRs overlap extensively with predicted  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of budding yeast, rather than DNA sequence-specified nucleosome positioning."," Context: show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is  especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions  at both ends of genes. Sequence polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome  positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning. These results reveal  that sequence polymorphisms are under selective constraints to maintain  nucleosome positioning. CONTACT: zhimdai@gmail.com; issdxh@mail.sysu.edu.cn  ,  Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context: The origin recognition complex (ORC) specifies replication origin location. The  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC recognizes the ARS (autonomously replicating  sequence) consensus sequence (ACS), but only a subset of potential genomic sites  are bound, suggesting other chromosomal features influence ORC binding. Using  high-throughput sequencing to map ORC binding and nucleosome positioning, we  show that yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned  nucleosomes flanking the ACS. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a  nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of  nucleosomes flanking the origin. These findings identify local nucleosomes as an important determinant for origin selection and function.

Aiming at clarifying this issue, we have revisited the structure of the human  hair follicle by means of X-ray microdiffraction. We conclude that the  histology-based growth zones along the follicle are correlated to the fine architecture of the filaments deduced from X-ray microdiffraction. Our analysis  reveals the existence of two major polymorph intermediate filament  architectures. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context:  Intermediate filaments are filaments 10 nm in diameter that make up an important  component of the cytoskeleton in most metazoan taxa. They are most familiar for  their role as the fibrous component of α-keratins such as skin, hair, nail, and horn but are also abundant within living cells. Although they are almost  exclusively intracellular in their distribution, in the case of the defensive  slime produced by hagfishes, they are secreted. This article surveys the impressive diversity of biomaterials that animals construct from intermediate  filaments and will focus on the mechanisms by which the mechanical properties of  these materials are achieved.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: A significant portion of the mammalian genome encodes numerous transcripts that  are not translated into proteins, termed long non-coding RNAs. Initial studies  identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence  of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the  last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and  function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long  non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes.  In this review, we describe the current understanding of long non-coding  RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes: differentiation, development, and  disease.  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated  JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to  chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2  revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an  important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of  MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin  distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by  which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment.  ,  Context:  The field of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) has expanded over the last decade following  the discoveries of several new classes of regulatory ncRNA. A growing amount of  evidence now indicates that ncRNAs are involved even in the most fundamental of cellular processes. The heat shock response is no exception as ncRNAs are being  identified as integral components of this process. Although this area of  research is only in its infancy, this article focuses on several classes of regulatory ncRNA (i.e., miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA), while summarizing their  activities in mammalian heat shock. We also present an updated model integrating  the traditional heat shock response with the activities of regulatory ncRNA.

We found that these antibodies  similarly induced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a  modification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these  signatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and  mouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of  m6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW is the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. It requires less than 3 hours on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as 1 GB of RAM is made available. The implementation is freely available," Context: large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.  RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package available on Bioconductor that detects hierarchical, biologically relevant Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) with automatic parameter selection."," Context: for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor,  http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .  ,  Context: that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in  yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates  an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family  members. Using this experimental system, we also demonstrate that mammalian cDNA  libraries can be screened successfully for cDNAs encoding novel bHLH proteins  that interact with E-box targets. Thus, this in vivo yeast system provides a  novel approach to facilitate functional studies of bHLH factor regulation.  ,  Context: or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single  plot.

CONTACT: kitty.lo@ucl.ac.uk SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are conserved during evolution and play  roles in guiding and constraining long-range regulation of gene expression.  Disruption of TAD boundaries results in aberrant gene expression by exposing  genes to inappropriate regulatory elements. Recent studies have shown that TAD  disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through  two mechanisms. One mechanism locally disrupts domains by deleting or mutating a  TAD boundary leading to fusion of the two adjacent TADs. The other mechanism  involves genomic rearrangements that break up TADs and creates new ones without  directly affecting TAD boundaries. Understanding the mechanisms by which TADs form and control long-range chromatin interactions will therefore not only  provide insights into the mechanism of gene regulation in general, but will also  reveal how genomic rearrangements and mutations in cancer genomes can lead to misregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.  ,  Context: are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,"Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose, live attenuated vaccine."," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: RESULTS: In August 1998 the Food and Drug Administration in the United States  approved the licensure of a rotavirus vaccine. Both the Advisory Committee of  Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics are likely to  recommend that the vaccine be given to all children by mouth as a series of  three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The vaccine is made by combining a  simian rotavirus strain (RRV) with several human strains representing different  rotavirus serotypes. An understanding of the biology, immunology, and virology  of rotavirus will help to explain the strengths and limitations of the rotavirus  vaccine. CONCLUSION: If used as recommended, the rotavirus vaccine should cause a significant decrease in the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and office  visits of children infected with rotavirus.  ,  Context: 15 weeks was associated with rotavirus vaccination (OR: 5.1; 95% CI 2.7, 9.4),  and receipt of the second pentavalent dose by age 32 weeks was associated with  receipt of two rotavirus vaccine doses (OR: 5.0; 95% CI 2.1-12.3). Timely  coverage with the first pentavalent vaccine dose was 88.2% in the 2007 cohort  and 91.1% in the 2008 cohort (p=0.04). Children born in 2009, when a four-month  national rotavirus vaccine stock-out occurred, had an older median age of  receipt of rotavirus vaccine and were less likely to receive rotavirus on the  same date as the same dose of pentavalent vaccine than children born in 2007 and  2008. Upper age limit recommendations for rotavirus vaccine administration contributed to suboptimal vaccination coverage. Survey data suggest that late  rotavirus vaccination and co-administration with later doses of pentavalent  vaccine among children born in 2009 helped increase rotavirus vaccine coverage following shortages.  ,  Context: adherence with the recommended schedules. We identified factors associated with  completing the full rotavirus series by performing multiple logistic regression  analyses. We also evaluated potential changes in uptake and timeliness of other  routine vaccines after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine using the  Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The national coverage for rotavirus vaccine achieved a year after the  introduction was 89% for one dose and 82% for two doses, respectively. Among  fully rotavirus-vaccinated children, 98% received both doses within the upper  age limit and 90% received both doses according to the recommended schedule. The  child's age at the initiation of rotavirus series and being vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b  (DTaP/IPV/Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines were the strongest predictors of  completing the full rotavirus series. No major changes in uptake and timeliness of other paediatric vaccines were observed after introduction of rotavirus  vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Norway achieved a high national coverage and excellent adherence  with the strict age limits for rotavirus vaccine administration during the first  ,  Context: authorized mAbs on the basis of their evolving variant landscape, regulatory  authorizations, and access to drugs. The current guidelines for the  administration of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab are informed by  an iterative process of testing and development.

In addition, this review  addresses the most common clinical questions received from health care  professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding indicated population, dose, use with  other medications and vaccines, duration of protection, and variants in clinical practice. As prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants can differ by country and state,  prescribing HCPs should consider the prevalence of bamlanivimab and etesevimab  resistant variants in their area, where data are available, regarding potential efficacy impact when considering treatment options.Trial Registration:  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04427501; NCT04411628; NCT04497987;  NCT04634409.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To review trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vaxchora, a  reformulated, single-dose, oral, lyophilized Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine  for the prevention of travel-related cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: H3K27me3 is generally found at repressed genes. This is not the case for  H3K9me3, the subject of this communication, which is a modification that has  traditionally been considered a mark of constitutive heterochromatin, but has  also been found in significant levels in expressed genes. We therefore sought to  use new high-throughput genome-wide maps of H3K9me3 localization to investigate  the conflicting hypotheses concerning the nature of this modification. Before we  could accurately analyze the locations of H3K9me3 along the genome, and  especially in repetitive locations, we developed a method for accurately  utilizing short sequencing reads that do not map uniquely to a location in the genome. Investigating the locations of H3K9me3 along the genome allowed us to  determine that, while there are high levels of H3K9me3 outside of genes, this  modification is not absent from genes. Therefore, we suggest that H3K9me3 may have a role in chromatin organization rather than being directly related to gene  expression. In addition, we have found that there is a need to include  repetitively matching reads in any high-throughput sequencing experiment.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and  we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  ,  Context: The Drosophila Toll-1 receptor is involved in embryonic development, innate  immunity, and tissue homeostasis. Currently, as a ligand for the Toll-1  receptor, only Spätzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized. We  previously reported that Drosophila larva-derived tissue extract contains ligand  activity for the Toll-1 receptor, which differs from Spz based on the  observation that larval extract prepared from spz mutants possessed full ligand  activity. Here, we demonstrate that Spz5, a member of the Spz family of  proteins, functions as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor. Processing of Spz5 by  Furin protease, which is known to be important for ligand activity of Spz5 to Toll-6, is not required for its function to the Toll-1 receptor. By generating a  spz5 null mutant, we further showed that the Toll-1 ligand activity of  larva-derived extract is mainly derived from Spz5. Finally, we found a genetic interaction between spz and spz5 in terms of developmental processes. This study  identified a novel ligand for the Drosophila Toll-1 receptor, providing evidence  that Toll-1 is a multi-ligand receptor, similar to the mammalian Toll-like  receptor.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"Slit ligands and NELL1/2 are ligands for the Robo family of receptors. Specifically, NELL1 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Rob"," Context: structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell  surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies provide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a  combinatorial manner required during neuronal development. While a mechanistic  understanding of Slit mediated Robo signaling has advanced significantly further structural studies on larger assemblies are required for the design of new  experiments to elucidate their role in cell surface receptor complexes. These  will be necessary to understand the role of Slit -Robo signaling in  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for  ,  Context: subunits, generating two integrins) and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster  (five alpha and one beta, generating five integrins). The alpha and beta  subunits have distinct domain structures, with extracellular domains from each  subunit contributing to the ligand-binding site of the heterodimer. The sequence  arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) was identified as a general  integrin-binding motif, but individual integrins are also specific for  particular protein ligands. Immunologically important integrin ligands are the  intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), immunoglobulin superfamily members  present on inflamed endothelium and antigen-presenting cells. On ligand binding, integrins transduce signals into the cell interior; they can also receive  intracellular signals that regulate their ligand-binding affinity. Here we  provide a brief overview that concentrates mostly on the organization, structure and function of mammalian integrins, which have been more extensively studied  than integrins in other organisms.  ,  Context: superposition of the ligands was performed with the tool Pharmacophore  Elucidation (MOE-package), which takes all conformations of the ligands into  account. This procedure led to four pharmacophoric structural elements with  aromatic, hydrophobic, cationic and H-bond acceptor properties. Using the  aligned structures a 3D-model of the ligand binding site of the sigma(1)  receptor was obtained, whose general features are in good agreement with  previous assumptions on the receptor structure, but revealed some novel insights  since it represents the receptor surface in more detail. Thus, e.g., our model  indicates the presence of an H-bond acceptor moiety in the binding site as counterpart to the ligands' cationic ammonium center, rather than a negatively  charged carboxylate group. The presented QSAR model is statistically valid and  represents the biological data of all tested compounds, including a test set of 21 ligands not used in the modeling process, with very good to excellent  accuracy [q(2) (training set, n=66; leave 1/3 out) = 0.84, p(2) (test set,  n=21)=0.64].

Consideration of receptor flexibility using an  ensemble of precompiled receptor conformations or by employing an effectively enlarged binding pocket has been reported to be useful. However, direct  consideration of receptor flexibility during energy optimization of the docked  conformation has been less popular because of the large increase in computational complexity. In this paper, we present a new docking program called  GalaxyDock that accounts for the flexibility of preselected receptor side-chains  by global optimization of an AutoDock-based energy function trained for flexible  ,  Context: A pharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of  functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target  shared by a group of compounds. Pharmacophores also represent the spatial  arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket. Structure  based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a  macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure. The SBP methods that derive pharmacophore from protein-ligand complexes use the potential interactions  observed between ligand and protein, whereas, the SBP method that aims to derive  pharmacophore from ligand free protein, uses only protein active site information. Therefore SBPs do not encounter to challenging problems such as  ligand flexibility, molecular alignment as well as proper selection of training  set compounds in ligand based pharmacophore modeling.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so  accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment. Median time to progression was 5.7 months  for thymoma patients and 3.6 months for thymic carcinoma patients. Saracatinib  was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Src inhibition by saracatinib did not produce any radiographic  responses, though some patients did experience stable disease. Though negative, this study shows the feasibility of completing a trial in this rare disease, and  of accruing reasonably significant numbers of thymic carcinoma patients.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acetate works by blocking the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), which significantly reduces androgen production."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer  progression. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness.  We describe a link between EZH2 function and actin polymerization in prostate  cancer cells.  METHODS: Nuclear and cytoplasmic EZH2 expression in benign and malignant  prostate tissue samples was assessed. An association between EZH2 function and  actin polymerization in prostate cancer cells was investigated using  siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Effects of EZH2 knock-down on actin  polymerization dynamics were analyzed biochemically using immunoblot analysis of  cell lysate fractions, and morphologically using immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate  epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2  expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. Knock-down of EZH2 in PC3 prostate cancer cells increases the amount of  F-actin polymerization, cell size, and formation of actin-rich filaments. CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic EZH2 is over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. EZH2  ,  Context: hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease where the previous concept of  ""hormone resistance"" has been changed by a new generation of hormonal therapies  that have proven efficacy in the castration-resistant setting. The fact is that  androgens play a crucial role in the whole clinical course of prostate cancer,  even when a patient meets castration-resistance criteria. The development of  abiraterone showed how important and clinically meaningful can be to achieve the lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression,  mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted  with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new  antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual  mechanism of action (galeterone). In this review the development of new hormonal  ,  Context:  As the first in class steroid 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitor,  abiraterone acetate (of which the active metabolite is abiraterone) has been  shown to improve overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)--in those who are chemotherapy-naive and those previously treated  with docetaxel. Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and congenital Horner syndrome are both recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context:  Reporting one case of this condition type-2 with heterochromia iridis and  cochlear deafness. The AA. review the syndrome's components and it nomenclature  as well. They discuss about the convenience of including this deviation in the chapter of ""diseases of the embryonic neural crest"". The specific place of the  gene responsibly in the chromosome-2 and the possibilities of genetic  counselling are considered.  ,  Context: 5'-untranslated region of EDN3 (EDNRB ligand) was detected in all affected  individuals but not in healthy carriers of the EDNRB mutation. Also, a de novo  CNVs encompassing DACH1 was identified in the patient with heterochromia iridum  and HSCR Since the EDNRB and EDN3 variants only coexist in affected individuals,  HSCR could be due to the joint effect of mutations in genes of the same pathway.  Iris heterochromia could be due to an independent genetic event and would  account for the additional phenotype within the family.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Heterochromia iridis, asymmetry of iris pigmentation, has been well  described with congenital Horner syndrome. Acquired heterochromia associated  with lesions in the ocular sympathetic pathways in adulthood, however, is rare. METHODS: Two cases are reported in which sympathectomy in adults resulted in  ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia. In each case, pharmacologic  testing with cocaine and hydroxyamphetamine was performed. RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRα is most important in fat, muscle, and heart."," Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both  systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma  glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced  any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that  central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute  alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following  systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act  centrally to modulate glucose metabolism.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize how thyroid hormones exert their effects on  lipid metabolism through specific interaction with their nuclear receptors, to  review studies of the effects of new and selective thyromimetic drugs in animals  and humans and to identify important questions for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid  hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRβ is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol  and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TRα is most important in fat, muscle, and  heart. Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics, tiromes) have been developed that activate TRβ and are selectively taken up and/or activated by the liver. Such  compounds stimulate hepatic LDL receptors, cholesterol elimination as bile acids  and cholesterol, and presumably promote reverse cholesterol transport. In  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are a group of genetic conditions  characterized by decreased tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormones. Three  syndromes, in which resistance to hormone action is respectively due to  mutations in the gene encoding for thyroid hormone receptor TRβ, impaired T4 and  T3 transport, and impaired conversion of T4 to T3 mediated by deiodinases. An  updated review of each of these forms of resistance is provided, and their  pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical approaches are discussed.  ,  Context: The effects of dronedarone, a non-iodinated derivative of amiodarone, on  ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation post-myocardial infarction  are not well established. Fifty-five Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a  2-week oral treatment with either vehicle (n=18), amiodarone (30 mg/kg, n=20),  or dronedarone (30 mg/kg, n=17). After acute coronary artery ligation, a  single-lead electrocardiogram was continuously recorded for 24 h and episodes of  ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation as well as mortality rates were analysed.  Monophasic action potential recordings were obtained from the left ventricular  epicardium at baseline and 24 h post-myocardial infarction. Thyroid hormones and catecholamines were measured using radioimmunoassay. Thyroid function was  similar in the 3 groups. Compared to controls, amiodarone and dronedarone  equally decreased the number of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes by approximately 75%. Both agents prevented the increase in monophasic action  potential duration and in beat-to-beat variation. Norepinephrine levels were  lower only after amiodarone treatment.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.  ,  Context: inhibited the expression of arginase-1, fizz1, and mrc1, other genes, such as  ym,1 mgl1, and mgl2, were not affected. The inhibition of arginase-1 occurred at  the transcriptional level with the inhibition of polymerase II binding to the  promoter. IL-4 induced STAT6 phosphorylation and binding to DNA. These  activities were not affected by TSA treatment. However, TSA inhibited C/EBPβ DNA  binding. This inhibitor induced acetylation on lysine residues 215-216, which  are critical for DNA binding. Finally, using macrophages from STAT6 KO mice we  showed that STAT6 is required for the DNA binding of C/EBPβ. These results  demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. These  findings also provide a molecular mechanism to explain the control of gene  expression through deacetylase activity.  ,  Context: anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase. The first step  induces partial Ume6p degradation when vegetative cells shift from glucose- to  acetate-based medium. Complete proteolysis happens only upon meiotic entry. Here  we demonstrate that the first step in Ume6p destruction is controlled by its  acetylation and deacetylation by the Gcn5p acetyltransferase and Rpd3p,  respectively. Ume6p acetylation occurs in medium lacking dextrose and results in  a partial destruction of the repressor. Preventing acetylation delays Ume6p  meiotic destruction and retards both the transient transcription program and  execution of the meiotic nuclear divisions. Conversely, mimicking acetylation induces partial destruction of Ume6p in dextrose medium and accelerates meiotic  degradation by the APC/C. These studies reveal a new mechanism by which  acetyltransferase activity induces gene expression through targeted destruction of a transcriptional repressor. These findings also demonstrate an important  role for nonhistone acetylation in the transition between mitotic and meiotic  cell division.

In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are  components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

Both  complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members:  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation  of Akt, PKCα (protein kinase Cα) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced  protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated  single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how  activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of  Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2  components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKCα  at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1  knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the  kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in  enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney.  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling.

RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening. CONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the  United Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice  ,  Context: canSAR (http://cansar.icr.ac.uk) is a public integrative cancer-focused  knowledgebase for the support of cancer translational research and drug  discovery. Through the integration of biological, pharmacological, chemical,  structural biology and protein network data, it provides a single information  portal to answer complex multidisciplinary questions including--among many  others--what is known about a protein, in which cancers is it expressed or  mutated, and what chemical tools and cell line models can be used to  experimentally probe its activity? What is known about a drug, its cellular  sensitivity profile and what proteins is it known to bind that may explain unusual bioactivity? Here we describe major enhancements to canSAR including new  data, improved search and browsing capabilities and new target, cancer cell  line, protein family and 3D structure summaries and tools.  ,  Context: The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)  demonstrated a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality. The  ongoing Comparison Arm for ProtecT (CAP) cluster randomised controlled trial  (RCT) evaluates prostate cancer screening effectiveness by comparing primary  care centres allocated to a round of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing  (intervention) or standard clinical care. Over 550 centres (around 450,000 men) were randomised in eight United Kingdom areas (2002-2008). Intervention group  participants were also eligible for the ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and  Treatment) RCT evaluating active monitoring, radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy treatments for localised prostate cancer. In ProtecT, over 1500 of  around 3000 men with prostate cancer were randomised from over 10,000 with an  elevated PSA in around 111,000 attendees at clinics.

METHODS: Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial health care issue in  general and urological practice. A PubMed database search was performed,  followed by a systematic review of the literature, to examine the evidence base underlying prostate cancer screening. RESULTS: A prostate cancer screening programme should satisfy several key  postulates prior to its introduction. To date, several of these postulates have  ,  Context: with Klinefelter syndrome in Britain from 1959 through 2002 and compared their  cancer incidence and mortality with that of men in the national population. All  statistical tests were two-sided.  RESULTS: The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all cancers was 1.2 (95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.4). Compared with the general population,  men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5,  95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from  prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). The standardized mortality ratios were particularly high for breast cancer among men with 47,XXY mosaicism (SMR =  222.8, 95% CI = 45.9 to 651.0) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men with a  48,XXYY constitution (SMR = 36.7, 95% CI = 4.4 to 132.5).

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, contributing to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."," Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and  deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive  span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking,  radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a  role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain  drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the  development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Yes, ospemifene is effective for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. In a multicenter phase 3 study, ospemifene significantly improved the severity of dys"," Context: vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel  selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal  atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and  physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo. A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years  who self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis  of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of ospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy  of ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells,  vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of  parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of  ,  Context: [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI =  7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P  = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001)  indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo. For the  comparison of long-term ospemifene with placebo, endometrial thickness (SMD =  0.90, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.23, P = 0.00001), treatment emergent adverse event,  discontinuations due to adverse event, and serious adverse event indicated that  ospemifene was generally safe. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal  atrophy.  ,  Context: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.  ,  Context: Ospemifene (Osphena™) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),  with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The drug is approved  in the USA, and application for EU regulatory approval is underway. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first  approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent  ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also  called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for  the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context:  Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except  nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in  the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. It is unclear how operons have become abundant in nematode genomes. The ""one-way street"" hypothesis asserts that once  formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage  would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C.  elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and  Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as  ,  Context:  The small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays a spectrum of DNA damage  responses similar to humans. In order to identify new DNA damage response genes,  we isolated in a forward genetic screen 14 new mutations conferring hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. We present here our characterization of  lem-3, one of the genes identified in this screen. LEM-3 contains a LEM domain  and a GIY nuclease domain. We confirm that LEM-3 has DNase activity in vitro. lem-3(lf) mutants are hypersensitive to various types of DNA damage, including  ionizing radiation, UV-C light and crosslinking agents. Embryos from irradiated  lem-3 hermaphrodites displayed severe defects during cell division, including  ,  Context: spliced as a single gene and sometimes as two genes; (5) SL1-type operons, which  use SL1 instead of SL2 to trans-splice and in which there is no intercistronic  space; (6) operons that make dicistronic mRNAs; and (7) non-operon gene  clusters, in which either two genes use a single exon as the 3' end of one and  the 5' end of the next, or the 3' UTR of one gene serves as the outron of the  next. Each of these variations is relatively infrequent, but together they show  a remarkable variety of tight-linkage gene arrangements in the C. elegans  genome.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac  complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondria are susceptible  to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause  cardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced  calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting. METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated  glucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular  calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and  ,  Context: Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into  focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular  tachyarrhythmias. Calcium overload and spontaneous calcium release from the  sarcoplasmatic reticulum are regarded as possible initiations of early and  delayed afterdepolarization thereby triggering ventricular arrhythmias. In  chronic heart failure, calcium overload is more likely to occur compared with healthy hearts, which is one explantation for the increased vulnerability in  this condition. L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX), and  ryanodine receptor are crucial for calcium homeostasis and therefore represent potential targets for antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Experimental studies have  proven beneficial effects for all these three mechanisms in prevention and  suppression of tachyarrhythmias. However, clinical data is mainly available for  ,  Context: SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated  ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR  ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased  in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR  Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with  insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view  that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ","3850773, 18570267, 22402252, 22673935, 8864644, 22590623",Yes.,"8864644, 8761317, 3384188, 22402252, 3850773, 10359740"
What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.," Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase  (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN expression and triglyceride accumulation associated with steatosis.  ,  Context: Fingolimod (Gilenya; FTY720), a synthetic compound based on the fungal secondary  metabolite myriocin (ISP-I), is a potent immunosuppressant that was approved  (September 2010) by the U.S. FDA as a new treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).  Fingolimod was synthesized by the research group of Tetsuro Fujita at Kyoto  University in 1992 while investigating structure-activity relationships of  derivatives of the fungal metabolite ISP-I, isolated from Isaria sinclairii. Fingolimod becomes active in vivo following phosphorylation by sphingosine  kinase 2 to form fingolimod-phosphate, which binds to extracellular G  protein-coupled receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphates, and prevents the release of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue. Fingolimod is orally active, which is unique  among current first-line MS therapies, and it has the potential to be used in  the treatment of organ transplants and cancer. This review highlights the  ,  Context: trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor  monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is  discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments.  Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: improves diastolic tone and oxygen handling during myocardial ischemia. In  addition, ranolazine seems to exert beneficial effects on diastolic cardiac  function. Moreover, there are experimental and clinical data about its  antiarrhythmic properties. A beneficial atrial selectivity of ranolazine has  been suggested that may be helpful for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The  purpose of this review article is to discuss possible future clinical  indications based on novel experimental and preclinical results and the  significance of the available data.  ,  Context: slightly modified, or defined post hoc, by demographic factors (including sex  and age), disease characteristics (including baseline disability scores, relapse  rates, and lesion parameters), and response to previous therapy (including  analyses in patients eligible for fingolimod treatment according to the European  label). Data were analysed by intention to treat. The FREEDOMS study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00289978.  FINDINGS: Treatment with fingolimod 0·5 mg was associated with significantly  lower ARRs versus placebo across all subgroups except for patients aged over 40  years. ARR ratios ranged from 0·76 (95% CI 0·54-1·09; p=0·13) in patients aged over 40 years to 0·29 (0·16-0·52; p<0·0001) in patients who had relapse activity  despite receiving interferon beta during the year before study enrolment.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, defining super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes. It interacts with chromatin modifiers at enhancers and super enhancers, and its essential function is mediated by Head and Middle"," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been  major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase  nuclei. Indeed, this organization is found to be non-random and individual  chromosomes occupy discrete regions known as territories. Determining the  factors that drive the spatial positioning of these territories within nuclei  has caused much debate; however, in proliferating cells, there is evidently a  correlation between radial positioning and gene density. Indeed, gene-poor  chromosomes tend to be located towards the nuclear edge, while those that are  more gene-rich are positioned more internally. These observations pose a number of questions: first, what is the function of this global organization and,  secondly, is it representative of that occurring at a more local scale? During  the course of this review, these questions will be considered, in light of the current literature regarding the role of transcription factories and the nuclear  matrix in interphase genome organization.  ,  Context: The role of the zinc finger protein CTCF in organizing the genome within the  nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both  CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop  domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also  mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different  domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the  questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting  them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears  that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the  existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that  invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What  remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for  re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis.  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Significant efforts have recently been put into the investigation of  the spatial organization and the chromatin-interaction networks of genomes.  Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and its derivatives are important tools used in this effort. However, many of these have limitations,  such as being limited to one viewpoint, expensive with moderate to low  resolution, and/or requiring a large sequencing effort. Techniques like Hi-C provide a genome-wide analysis. However, it requires massive sequencing effort  with considerable costs. Here we describe a new technique termed Targeted  Chromatin Capture (T2C), to interrogate large selected regions of the genome.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Yes, colistin is mentioned as an antibiotic in multiple contexts, specifically as a treatment for infections such as Acinetobacter baumannii infection and as a potential candidate for treating antibiotic-resistant UTIs."," Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in  the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the  possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the  rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century.  Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context: To investigate the impact of interacting drugs on the dispensed doses of  warfarin in the Swedish population. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional  population based register study of patients being dispensed warfarin. Warfarin  doses were estimated in different age groups, in men and women, and in patients  using interacting drugs. The influence of interacting drugs on the dispensed  warfarin dose was analyzed using multiple regression. All 143,729 patients  dispensed warfarin were analyzed. The dispensed dose of warfarin was highest in  patients 30-39 years old and decreased with age. Co-medication with  carbamazepine, simvastatin, paracetamol, amiodarone, fluconazole, lactulose, or bezafibrate was associated with significant changes in dispensed warfarin doses,  by +40%, -3.4%, -7.3%, -8.2%, -8.8%, -9.0%, and -9.7%, respectively. After  adjustment for age and gender, sulfamethoxazole was also found to significantly alter the dispensed warfarin dose (-6.1%). We provide new support for the  previous scarce evidence of interactions between warfarin and carbamazepine,  bezafibrate, and lactulose. Initiation or discontinuation of bezafibrate or  ,  Context: been shown that S. aureus carries the ica operon responsible for biofilm  production. The aim of the work is to determine a genotypic characterization  that includes not only the detection of icaA and icaD genes in S. aureus but  also the determination of their relation to clinical and microbiological  features. Empiric antibacterial treatment was recommended for cancer patients  receiving chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relation between the presence of icaA and icaD and  biofilm production was determined in a collection of 66 S. aureus samples from  febrile neutropenic patients. Biofilm-forming ability was tested on Congo Red  agar plates. Also, the effect of the most sensitive antibiotics on the bacterial cells was determined by an electron microscope. RESULTS: Of the bacterial samples, 48 were biofilm-productive and 18 were  non-biofilm productive. For the biofilm productive bacteria, 37.5% were positive for icaA, 22.9% were positive for icaD and 10.4% were positive for both.  Linezolid was the most effective antibiotic and it is highly recommended for the  treatment of febrile neutropenia caused by biofilm-productive S. aureus.
