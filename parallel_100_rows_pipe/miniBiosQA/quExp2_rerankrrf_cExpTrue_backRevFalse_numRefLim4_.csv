What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ,  Context: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic  mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma. We  examined the role of PCDH10 as a mediator of medulloblastoma cell proliferation,  cell cycle progression, and cell migration. METHODS: We identified a focal homozygous deletion of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma  by surveying a cohort of 212 tumours by Affymetrix SNP array analysis. PCDH10  expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in a series of  26 tumours. The promoter methylation status of PCDH10 was determined using  methylation specific PCR and Sequenom MassCLEAVE analysis. Functional studies examining the role of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma development were performed by  re-expression of PCDH10 in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, and then, cell  proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration assays were  performed. RESULTS: We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3  harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is  down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other  ,  Context: by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of  RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A  hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable  in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological  variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that  comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for  identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma  development.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"There is no explicit mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation, suggesting a potential role in cell growth or division"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes and  thus represent a promising cell source for cardiac regenerative therapy.  Nevertheless, the therapeutic application of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes is  limited by the low efficacy of the current protocol for cardiac differentiation  and their immature phenotypes. Although thyroid hormone is essential for normal  cardiac development and function, its role in the cardiac differentiation of ESCs, as well as the maturation of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes, remains unclear.  In this study, we examined the cardiac differentiation of murine ESCs in the  presence of T(3) for 7 d using flow cytometry, RT-PCR, cellular electrophysiology study, and confocal calcium imaging. Compared with control  conditions, T(3) supplementation increased the number of ESC-derived  cardiomyocytes and was accompanied by up-regulation of a panel of cardiac  ","28430577, 2702688, 19783418, 20667986",STAG1/STAG2 proteins are tumour suppressor proteins that suppress cell proliferation and are essential for differentiation.,"26997282, 21589869, 19822671, 29867216, 15361841, 28430577, 27298259, 12034751, 18276799"
What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"A hazard ratio (HR) of 1.3 was found for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma) with >10-year latency, indicating a possible increased risk of glioblastoma associated with long-term cell phone use."," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for  ,  Context: RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: A practical mathematical model for glioblastomas (brain tumours), which  incorporates the two key parameters of tumour growth, namely the cancer cell  diffusion and the cell proliferation rate, has been shown to be clinically  useful and predictive. Previous studies explain why multifocal recurrence is  inevitable and show how various treatment scenarios have been incorporated in  the model. In most tumours, it is not known when the cancer started. Based on  patient in vivo parameters, obtained from two brain scans, it is shown how to  estimate the time, after initial detection, when the tumour started. This is an  input of potential importance in any future controlled clinical study of any connection between cell phone radiation and brain tumour incidence. It is also  used to estimate more accurately survival times from detection. Finally, based  on patient parameters, the solution of the model equation of the tumour growth helps to explain why certain patients live longer than others after similar  treatment protocols specifically surgical resection (removal) and irradiation.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent, meaning it can be applied to various organisms without relying on known promoter elements. It has been tested as a case study in identifying novel architectures in the fly genome."," Context: The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates  transcription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is  essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental  methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate  computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of  methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new  method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in Homo  sapiens and Mus musculus, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes were used to convert DNA sequences into feature vectors. To test the length  effect, for each species, datasets including sequences with different lengths  were built. The results demonstrated that ncPro-ML achieved the best performance  ,  Context: The identification of promoters and their regulatory elements is one of the  major challenges in bioinformatics and integrates comparative, structural, and  functional genomics. Many different approaches have been developed to detect  conserved motifs in a set of genes that are either coregulated or orthologous.  However, although recent approaches seem promising, in general, unambiguous  identification of regulatory elements is not straightforward. The delineation of  promoters is even harder, due to its complex nature, and in silico promoter  prediction is still in its infancy. Here, we review the different approaches  that have been developed for identifying promoters and their regulatory elements. We discuss the detection of cis-acting regulatory elements using  word-counting or probabilistic methods (so-called ""search by signal"" methods)  and the delineation of promoters by considering both sequence content and structural features (""search by content"" methods). As an example of search by  content, we explored in greater detail the association of promoters with CpG  islands. However, due to differences in sequence content, the parameters used to  ,  Context: We have detected a DNAseI hypersensitive site in the ribosomal DNA spacer of  Xenopus laevis and Xenopus borealis. The site is present in blood and embryonic  nuclei of each species. In interspecies hybrids, however, the site is absent in  unexpressed borealis rDNA, but is present normally in expressed laevis rDNA.  Hypersensitive sites are located well upstream (over lkb) of the pre-ribosomal  RNA promoter. Sequencing of the hypersensitive region in borealis rDNA, however, shows extensive homology with the promoter sequence, and with the hypersensitive  region in X. laevis. Of two promoter-like duplications in each spacer, only the  most upstream copy is associated with hypersensitivity to DNAaseI. Unlike DNAaseI, Endo R. MspI digests the rDNA of laevis blood nuclei at a domain  extending downstream from the hypersensitive site to near the 40S promoter.  Since the organisation of conserved sequence elements within this ""proximal  ,  Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery."," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is  Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is  the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease (LBD) is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context: Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS).  Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS. However, alternative splicing of the AS gene is also known to modify AS  aggregation propensities. Splicing gives rise to four related forms of the  protein, the main transcript and those that lack exon 4, exon 6, or both. Since  ,  Context:  We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).," Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Raoultella terrigena, a bacterial species isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish, is associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) production."," Context: which gives a negative blanching test but is readily neutralized by a human  serum which gives a positive blanching test. It is not neutralized by normal  horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal  antistreptococcic serum. In a limited number of observations on the urine of  patients with scarlet fever a similar toxic substance has been found in two out  of five cases studied. Since the toxic substance described appears to resemble  the toxic substance found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic  streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by  a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a  local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus haemolyticus  capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease.  ,  Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX).

The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. It creates regions of reduced variation in the genome."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include GFP-LC3, GFP-Atg5, LC3B, ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1), and SQSTM1"," Context: known to exist. Recent evidence suggests that this form of autophagy enforces  intracellular quality control by selectively disposing of aberrant protein  aggregates and damaged organelles--common denominators in various forms of  neurodegenerative diseases. By definition, this form of autophagy, termed  quality-control (QC) autophagy, must be different from nutrient-regulated  autophagy in substrate selectivity, regulation and function. We have recently  identified the ubiquitin-binding deacetylase, HDAC6, as a key component that  establishes QC. HDAC6 is not required for autophagy activation per se; rather,  it is recruited to ubiquitinated autophagic substrates where it stimulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by promoting F-actin remodeling in a  cortactin-dependent manner. Remarkably, HDAC6 and cortactin are dispensable for  starvation-induced autophagy. These findings reveal that autophagosomes associated with QC are molecularly and biochemically distinct from those  associated with starvation autophagy, thereby providing a new molecular  framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and therapeutic  ,  Context: (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins  contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  monitoring autophagy, including the use of GFP-LC3 and GFP-Atg5, are discussed.  ,  Context: genes belonging to the core molecular machinery involved in autophagosome  formation have been discovered, relatively little is known about the nature of  signaling networks controlling autophagy upon intracellular or extracellular  stimuli. We discovered ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP and GABARAPL1) as  novel interactors of MAPK15/ERK8, a MAP kinase involved in cell proliferation  and transformation. Based on the role of these proteins in the autophagic  process, we demonstrated that MAPK15 is indeed localized to autophagic  compartments and increased, in a kinase-dependent fashion, ATG8-like proteins  lipidation, autophagosome formation and SQSTM1 degradation, while decreasing LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation. Interestingly, we also identified a conserved  LC3-interacting region (LIR) in MAPK15 responsible for its interaction with  ATG8-like proteins, for its localization to autophagic structures and, consequently, for stimulation of the formation of these compartments.  Furthermore, we reveal that MAPK15 activity was induced in response to serum and  amino-acid starvation and that this stimulus, in turn, required endogenous  ,  Context: Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (Pérez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008).

Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost  always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to  produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding  genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic  repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional  ,  Context: myogenesis and altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling  myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from  the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an  in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer, rather than inhibiting it."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This is evident in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations, which is"," Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.

Next, the temporal- and dose-dependent effects of TNF-α  on CIDEC expression in human SW872 adipocytes were investigated. Selective  inhibitors or RNAi or constitutively active MEK1 mutant was used to suppress or  stimulate MEK/ERK cascade. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation  technique were used to study PPARγ redistribution after TNF-α treatment.  Reporter assay was performed to confirm the direct effects of TNF-α on CIDEC  transcription.  RESULTS: CIDEC expression decreased in adipose tissue of subjects with obesity  and negatively correlated with adipose TNF-α levels and systemic lipolysis.  TNF-α reduced CIDEC expression in vitro, but suppression of MEK/ERK cascade prevented TNF-α-mediated CIDEC downregulation. PPARγ, the transcription factor  of CIDEC, was phosphorylated and redistributed by TNF-α in a MEK/ERK-dependent  manner. Reporter assay confirmed that TNF-α reduced CIDEC transcription. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-α downregulates CIDEC expression through phosphorylation and  nuclear export of PPARγ by MEK/ERK cascade.  ,  Context: Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation. As transcription of IE genes does not require  prior viral protein synthesis, this class of genes is experimentally defined by  their transcription following primary infection or reactivation in the presence  of inhibitors of protein synthesis. This chapter describes an approach to  identify IE genes in a novel herpesvirus genome. Transcription of IE genes is selectively induced with sodium butyrate in the presence of the protein  synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The transcripts of the induced genes are  identified by using a cDNA subtraction-based method of gene expression  screening.  ,  Context: expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics  translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental  disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created  mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality.  Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered  dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature  transcripts and govern their fate. However, natural IGs manage to maintain  satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the  problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare condition characterized by giant cystic lesions in the abdomen, often involving aggravated abdominal pain. It can be mistaken for true tumors such as chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, or synov"," Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context:  Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best  ,  Context: Hemophilia is a serious bleeding disorder characterized by repeated bleeding  episodes into joints and muscles which can lead to permanent disabilities.  Treatment with factor replacement therapy has proven to be effective at  preventing these complications; however, it can lead to formation of  neutralizing antibodies termed inhibitors which significantly complicate the  management of the disorder. These inhibitor patients suffer from increased morbidity and mortality and there has been a major unmet need for novel  therapeutic approaches. Recently, one such therapy, emicizumab, has been  licensed in the United States. Areas covered: This manuscript contains a detailed discussion of the mechanism of action, the clinical trial development  program as well as a review of the benefits and risks of this novel agent. In  addition, practical considerations for the use of the agent are also described.  ,  Context:  Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are oral anticoagulants used to prevent or  treat thrombosis in a variety of situations. Like all anticoagulants, these  drugs can provoke bleeding. How should patients be managed if bleeding occurs during dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban therapy? How can the risk of bleeding  be reduced in patients who require surgery or other invasive procedures? To  answer these questions, we reviewed the available literature, using the standard Prescrire methodology. In clinical trials, warfarin, enoxaparin, dabigatran,  rivaroxaban and apixaban were associated with a similar frequency of severe  bleeding. Numerous reports of severe bleeding associated with dabigatran have  ","31725667, 32490041, 30278802, 23866358","Hemophilic Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus and severe corneal scarring due to a firework explosion 45 years ago are managed by the Athens Protocol.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.  SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center,  superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group  B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33  to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72  μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C.

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one keratoconic cases subjected to the Athens  Protocol procedure were studied for visual acuity, keratometry, pachymetry, and anterior surface irregularity indices up to 3 years postoperatively by  Scheimpflug imaging (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). RESULTS: Mean visual acuity changes at 3 years postoperatively were +0.38 ± 0.31 (range: -0.34 to +1.10) for uncorrected distance visual acuity and +0.20 ± 0.21  (range: -0.32 to +0.90) for corrected distance visual acuity. Mean K1 (flat  meridian) keratometric values were 46.56 ± 3.83 diopters (D) (range: 39.75 to  ,  Context: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults.  UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous  melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor."," Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent  cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of  signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine  phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear  translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal  physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However,  compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many  cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates  cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis. In this paper, we first describe the mechanism of STAT3  regulation followed by how STAT3 is involved in cancer metastasis, then we  summarize the various small molecule inhibitors that inhibit STAT3 signaling.  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant  disorder characterized by widespread benign tumor formation in a variety of  organs. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible  for TSC. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin,  respectively, form a physical and functional complex and inhibit the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth promoting pathway. mTORC1 plays an essential  role in a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription,  trafficking and autophagy. In this review, we will discuss recent progresses in the TSC-mTOR field and their physiological functions and alterations of this  pathway in pathophysiology.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal at 2 hours post-fertilization, suggesting a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates."," Context: These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are  highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of  the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a  uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h  post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations  lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread  cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into the identities, formation, and evolution of zebrafish 3' UTRs provide a resource  for studying gene regulation during vertebrate development.  ,  Context: SET domain-containing proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved family of  epigenetic regulators, which are responsible for most histone lysine  methylation. Since some of these genes have been revealed to be essential for  embryonic development, we propose that the zebrafish, a vertebrate model  organism possessing many advantages for developmental studies, can be utilized  to study the biological functions of these genes and the related epigenetic mechanisms during early development. To this end, we have performed a  genome-wide survey of zebrafish SET domain genes. 58 genes total have been  identified. Although gene duplication events give rise to several lineage-specific paralogs, clear reciprocal orthologous relationship reveals  high conservation between zebrafish and human SET domain genes. These data were  further subject to an evolutionary analysis ranging from yeast to human, leading  ,  Context: desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high  degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the 3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf).

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,"PMP22 gene has been found to be mutated in CMT1A. Specifically, the T118M mutation in PMP22 is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A (CMT1A)."," Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,"Avapritinib selectively inhibits oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. Specifically, it targets mutant forms of KIT and PDGFRA,"," Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context: avapritinib 300 mg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11 months. Main toxicities were grade 2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: Consequently, developing or identifying modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 that are  suitable for clinical practice is of great importance. Therefore, we have  explored the drug repositioning approach to identify candidate modulators of  ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological  properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that  avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine  kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor  receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and  ABCG2. Moreover, avapritinib restores the chemosensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. These findings  were further supported by results of apoptosis induction assays, ATP hydrolysis  assays, and docking of avapritinib in the drug-binding pockets of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Altogether, our study highlights an additional action of avapritinib on  ABC drug transporters, and a combination of avapritinib with conventional  chemotherapy should be further investigated in patients with MDR tumors.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in fine-tuning the level of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. They also act as microRNA ""sponges"" to counteract micro"," Context: Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs  in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular  RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being  associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with  individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  ,  Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: Many thousands of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been identified in  metazoan genomes by transcriptome-wide sequencing. Most circRNAs are generated  by back-splicing events from exons of protein-coding genes. A great deal of  progress has recently been made in understanding the genome-wide expression  patterns, biogenesis, and regulation of circRNAs. To date, however, few  functions of circRNAs have been identified. CircRNAs are preferentially  expressed in neural tissues and some are found at synapses, suggesting possible  functions in the nervous system. Several circRNAs have been shown to function as  microRNA ""sponges"" to counteract microRNA mediated repression of mRNA. New functions for circRNAs are arising, including protein sequestration,  transcriptional regulation, and potential functions in cancer. Here, we  highlight the recent progress made in understanding the biogenesis and regulation of circRNAs, discuss newly uncovered circRNA functions, and explain  the methodological approaches that could reveal more exciting and unexpected  roles for these RNAs.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types. Therefore, the present review  evaluated recent research articles in PubMed that were published between November 2017 and September 2020.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is used at synchrotron radiation facilities for time-resolved applications of x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray Raman scattering (XRS).," Context: the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms. The present method offers a potential for ab initio structural  determination in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography.  ,  Context: Matter with a high energy density (>10(5) joules per cm(3)) is prevalent  throughout the Universe, being present in all types of stars and towards the  centre of the giant planets; it is also relevant for inertial confinement  fusion. Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure,  requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous  temperatures and densities. With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source  (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been investigated. An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray  interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for  applications. Here we report the experimental creation of a solid-density plasma at temperatures in excess of 10(6) kelvin on inertial-confinement timescales  using an X-ray free-electron laser. We discuss the pertinent physics of the  intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion  ,  Context: A multi-crystal wavelength dispersive hard x-ray spectrometer with high-energy  resolution and large solid angle collection is described. The instrument is  specifically designed for time-resolved applications of x-ray emission  spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) at X-ray Free Electron  Lasers (XFEL) and synchrotron radiation facilities. It also simplifies resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the whole 2d RIXS plane. The  spectrometer is based on the Von Hamos geometry. This dispersive setup enables  an XES or XRS spectrum to be measured in a single-shot mode, overcoming the  scanning needs of the Rowland circle spectrometers. In conjunction with the XFEL temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics  of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction  kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage.  ,  Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated extracranial abnormalities in only a minority of cases. It represents a continuum usually divided into three types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar, each"," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of  ,  Context:  Exencephaly/anencephaly is a rare neural tube defect occurring early in  embryogenesis. We report a 14-week-old fetus with exencephaly in whom central  nervous system tissue was developed and preserved. There were 2 symmetrical structures grossly resembling cerebral hemispheres, which on histologic and  ultrastructural study, consisted of a combination of ependymoblastomatous  rosettes and canals and primitive neural tissue. The brainstem and spinal cord were partially normally formed, although descending tracts were not apparent. No  cerebellar tissue was found. The eyes were formed. This appears to represent a  rare example of exencephaly not covered by skin, which did not undergo necrosis  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common developmental defect of the forebrain  characterized by inadequate or absent midline division of the forebrain into  cerebral hemispheres, with concomitant midline facial defects in the majority of  cases. Understanding the pathogenesis of HPE requires knowledge of the  relationship between the developing brain and the facial structures during  embryogenesis. A number of signaling pathways control and coordinate the  development of the brain and face, including Sonic hedgehog, Bone morphogenetic  protein, Fibroblast growth factor, and Nodal signaling. Mutations in these  pathways have been identified in animal models of HPE and human patients. Because of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of HPE, patients  carrying defined mutations may not manifest the disease at all, or have a  spectrum of defects. It is currently unknown what drives manifestation of HPE in genetically at-risk individuals, but it has been speculated that other gene  mutations and environmental factors may combine as cumulative insults. HPE can  be diagnosed in utero by a high-resolution prenatal ultrasound or a fetal  ,  Context: Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated  extracranial, symptomatic abnormalities in only a minority of cases. The class  of brain defects known as holoprosencephaly represents a continuum usually  divided into three types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar. Each has both  distinctive radiological characteristics and some similarities. Typical facial  anomalies are found in the severe forms. Absent septum pellucidum and septo-optic dysplasia, possibly of similar embryological origin, have some  resemblances to lobar holoprosencephaly, but are clinically and radiologically  separate in most instances.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare entity characterized by dark pigmented intracellular granules seen within macrophages that lie within the lamina propria of the duodenal villi.," Context: Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare entity characterised by dark pigmented  intracellular granules seen within macrophages that lie within the lamina  propria of the duodenal villi. There is no known treatment, and the clinical  significance and long-term sequelae of this entity are unclear. We present a  case of pseudomelanosis duodeni in a 54-year-old woman who presented with a  1-month history of nausea, vomiting and non-bloody diarrhoea. The medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease  status postkidney transplant, hypertension, anaemia of chronic disease and  hypothyroidism. A gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed pigmented dark lesions in the duodenal mucosa. Biopsies from the second part of the duodenum and duodenal  bulb showed pigmented macrophages in the lamina propria. The findings were  consistent with duodenal melanosis. In spite of renal transplant with  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse  small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum.

Here, we describe the case of an  83-year-old female, with a complicated medical history, who was referred to  gastroenterologist to assess bleeding risk. From the endoscopy, it was  determined that she had both melanosis gastri and duodeni. Although both are  rare, gastric melanosis appears to be even more unusual than duodenal melanosis,  with only a few reported cases documented in the literature thus far.  ,  Context: Duodenal pseudomelanosis (or pseudomelanosis duodeni) is a rare benign condition  characterized by black-brown speckled pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa.  Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding. Medications such as ferrous sulfate, hydralazine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide  are thought to play a role as well. We report a case of a 86-year-old female who  presented with a history of watery diarrhea and melena. The patient had a history of high blood pressure and ischemic stroke episodes.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 mitigates TRalpha1 effects and attenuates TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 activities.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group.

It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context:  Data on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to  coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is increasing in the current COVID-19  pandemic.

Several small molecules antagonizing  the CGRP receptor have been developed as migraine-specific acute medications.  The CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant, also known as MK-1602, has been  recently evaluated in phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and  long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura. EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and  ,  Context: BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered to be a worldwide health  problem because of its increasing incidence and prevalence.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"According to available data, the Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. They have reported case fatality rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks."," Context: Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an  anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug  functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir  contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus,  rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of  favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic  efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an  epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important  ,  Context: The sporadic occurrence of Echo virus types 27 and 31 in association with  aseptic meningitis during the enterovirus seasons in Ontario in 1959 to 1962 is  reported.The etiological significance of both of these isolates was verified by  demonstration of type-specific serological response in meningitis patients. Echo  27, which up to now has not been encountered in association with human illness,  could be added to the list of viral agents capable of causing aseptic  meningitis. Isolation of Echo 31 from cerebrospinal fluid provides definite  proof of the etiological significance of this virus in cases of aseptic  meningitis.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both IL-1α and IL-1β cytokine receptors. It is a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein that neutralizes both IL-1α and IL-1β.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ","33200890, 19649332, 32324502, 32562029",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation. ATAT1 is responsible for ac," Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  ,  Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  ,  Context: Angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cell migration, which was  blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. It has been reported  that angiotensin II is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by  mechanical stretch in endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that endothelial  cells subjected to a 10% uniaxial stretch showed vertical alignment to the  direction of tension and tubulin deacetylation in the peripheral side of cells,  in comparison with control static cells. The mechanical stretch-induced changes  of microtubules were blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion.  Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that acetylated tubulin was decreased in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in the intima of  the aortic walls in mice loaded with angiotensin II, in comparison with mice  loaded with control vehicle. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in  endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced  vascular remodeling.  ,  Context: In addition, the local recurrence and distant metastasis of AB also sometimes  occurs, which resembles one of the typical malignant potentials. From these  points of view, to understand better the mechanisms of AB cell migration or  invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be both tumor-promoting and antitumor effector cells. Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, suggesting that they may be a valuable target for anticancer therapy. However, their"," Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context: The concept of immunotherapy of cancer is more than a century old, but only  recently have molecularly defined therapeutic approaches been developed. In this  review, we focus on the most promising approach, active therapeutic vaccination.  The identification of tumour antigens can now be accelerated by methods allowing  the amplification of gene products selectively or preferentially transcribed in  the tumour. However, determining the potential immunogenicity of such gene  products remains a demanding task, since major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  restriction of T cells implies that for any newly defined antigen,  immunogenicity will have to be defined for any individual MHC haplotype. Tumour-derived peptides eluted from MHC molecules of tumour tissue are also a  promising source of antigen. Tumour antigens are mostly of weak immunogenicity,  because the vast majority are tumour-associated differentiation antigens already 'seen' by the patient's immune system. Effective therapeutic vaccination will  thus require adjuvant support, possibly by new approaches to immunomodulation  such as bispecific antibodies or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins.  ,  Context: It is well established that MHC class I molecules present peptides from  endogenous proteins, such as virus or tumour antigens, to CD8+ T lymphocytes.  This implies that expression of MHC class I molecules on tumours is also  mandatory for an effective T cell response against neoplasias. Indeed, numerous  murine models exist (such as IC9, 3LL, P815) in which the existence of MHC  presented tumour antigens and a protective CTL response have been well  documented (reviewed in Hämmerling et al, 1987). However, the key question of  whether cytolytic T cell attack has a role in human cancer remains unsolved.  Similarly, the role of NK cells is unclear; these seem to lyse cells with low levels of MHC class I expression more efficiently. So far, human tumour specific  antigens that can be presented by HLA molecules have not been identified on the  molecular level. For a subpopulation of patients with malignant melanoma, the existence of tumour antigen can be deduced from the existence of tumour specific  cytotoxic T cells isolated from TIL. However, for other epidemiologically more  important tumours such as carcinomas of the colon, breast and lung, even  ","29594035, 34276698, 11599633, 1423320",Therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional therapies has yielded promising results.,29594035
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, GFI1B is crucial for hematopoiesis. It controls the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. Its absence"," Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context:  Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of  transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Gfi1b-null embryos die at  midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice  that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid  specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full  gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to  adulthood.

Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma).

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles.," Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/. CONTACTS: jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning are two key mechanisms that  contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression. During carcinogenesis,  the expression of many genes is altered alongside extensive changes in the  epigenome, with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA  hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. However the  spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and  Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods  that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published  by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with  ,  Context: AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Patient adherence including compliance and  persistence with biologic DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This is a comprehensive review of the literature. The  various definitions and methodologies of measurement used in adherence research  are reviewed and data are presented by separating compliance and persistence.  Differences in compliance rates were mainly based on numerical trends. There was  evidence for and against greater persistence with infliximab versus adalimumab  and etanercept. There was a trend in favour of greater compliance and lower  persistence with TNF-alpha inhibitor monotherapy versus in combination therapy  with methotrexate. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The evidence suggests that adherence to biologic DMARDs is  suboptimal. When further research is applied in the field, agreed definitions  and methodology need to be used to allow for cross-study comparisons. In addition, adherence should be assessed in conjunction with clinical outcomes and  not on its own so that it can be better understood what levels of adherence  provide the required clinical outcomes.  ,  Context: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development and  progression of periodontal disease. Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies.

AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared. Data were  analyzed by repeated-measures one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test for finger  measurements and group comparisons and Pearson's and Spearman's tests for  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on  1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing. This article summarizes the use of IDH  inhibitors in AML with IDH mutations.  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: Somatic point mutations at a key arginine residue (R132) within the active site  of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) confer a novel gain of  function in cancer cells, resulting in the production of d-2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), an oncometabolite. Elevated 2-HG levels are implicated in epigenetic  alterations and impaired cellular differentiation. IDH1 mutations have been  described in an array of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant  enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to  effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. Preliminary data from phase 1 clinical trials enrolling patients with cancers harboring an IDH1  mutation indicate that AG-120 has an acceptable safety profile and clinical  activity.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current status of emerging therapies  for hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the United States.

They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis. Aims Autosomal-dominant as well as X-linked inheritance for NCCM has been described and several loci have been associated with the disease.  Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.

BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis. When  2-OH-dATP was present at a concentration equal to those of the four normal dNTPs  in the reaction mixture, DNA synthesis by h Poleta enhanced the frequency of  ,  Context: TFBS has shaped up gene-specific regulatory networks. Alu exonized transcripts  are raw material for dsRNA-mediated A-I editing leading to nuclear retention of  transcripts and change in miRNA target. miRNA targets within Alu may titrate the  effective miRNA or transcript concentration, thus acting as 'miRNA sponge'.  Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await  clear functional understanding. These have contributed toward evolution of  complex regulatory repertoire leading to the evolution of primate-specific  functions. Recent reports of co-localization of pol II and pol III binding sites  near the gene and elsewhere in the genome, increase the possibility of dynamic co-ordination between both pol II and pol III determining the ultimate  transcriptional outcome.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by establishing mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at the wrong time. It tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes, also colocal"," Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.

Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It also participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that  constitute the effector arm of the apoptotic machinery. Studies in  Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse point to  evolutionarily conserved caspase function in developmentally programmed cell  death in metazoans. Whereas in the nematode all developmental cell death is  mediated by a single caspase, in Drosophila and the mouse some caspases appear to regulate cell death in a spatio-temporally restricted manner. This article  reviews what we currently know about the roles of various caspases in the  execution of developmentally programmed cell death and what may be expected from future research in this field.  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a  conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic  helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Antacids, catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, acetazolamide, imatinib, diuretics, and bisphosphonates are associated with drug-induced hypophosphatemia"," Context: Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia  frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context: phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: were confirmed.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"No, deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. However, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent"," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: We have purified a human histone H4 lysine 20 methyltransferase and cloned the  encoding gene, PR/SET07. A mutation in Drosophila pr-set7 is lethal: second  instar larval death coincides with the loss of H4 lysine 20 methylation,  indicating a fundamental role for PR-Set7 in development. Transcriptionally  competent regions lack H4 lysine 20 methylation, but the modification coincided  with condensed chromosomal regions on polytene chromosomes, including chromocenter and euchromatic arms. The Drosophila male X chromosome, which is  hyperacetylated at H4 lysine 16, has significantly decreased levels of lysine 20  methylation compared to that of females. In vitro, methylation of lysine 20 and acetylation of lysine 16 on the H4 tail are competitive. Taken together, these  results support the hypothesis that methylation of H4 lysine 20 maintains silent  chromatin, in part, by precluding neighboring acetylation on the H4 tail.  ,  Context: cycle exit with quiescence is unclear. We find that primary human fibroblasts  induced into quiescence exhibit tighter chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry  analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in  quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in  proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases  shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and  H4K20me3 in quiescence. Knockdown of the enzyme that creates H4K20me3 results in  an increased fraction of cells in S phase, a defect in exiting the cell cycle,  and decreased chromatin compaction. Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for  H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in  its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells.

Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome  and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport  channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the  ,  Context:  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb, Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR. We review  ,  Context: 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,"Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single pill, known as Avandamet."," Context: Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and  rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  represents an optimal approach to the treatment of diabetes. This manuscript  reviews the pharmacology, safety and benefits of the combination pill Avandamet.  ,  Context: hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by carrying antisense sequences, which offers the advantage of long-term effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. Additionally, bifunctional oligonucleotides called U1 Adaptors can tether"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory  elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  snRNA (ExSpeU1) able to rescue splicing impaired by the different types of  mutations. Through splicing-competent cDNA constructs, we demonstrated that the  ExSpeU1-mediated splicing correction of several F9 mutations results in complete restoration of secreted functional factor IX levels. Furthermore, two ExSpeU1s  for SMA improved SMN exon 7 splicing in the chromosomal context of normal cells.  We propose ExSpeU1s as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct, in several human disorders, different types of splicing mutations associated with defective exon  definition.  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases.

These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context:  Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists.

The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially  recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in  the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The  2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against  the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM),  compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and  GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and  expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and  ,  Context: Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor  subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no  mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: Many bacterial genomes are under asymmetric mutational pressure which introduces  compositional asymmetry into DNA molecule resulting in many biases in coding  structure of chromosomes. One of the processes affected by the asymmetry is  translocation changing the position of the coding sequence on chromosome in  respect to the orientation on the leading and lagging DNA strand. When analysing  sets of paralogs in 50 genomes, we found that the number of observed genes which switched their positions on DNA strand is lowest for genomes with the highest  DNA asymmetry. However, the number of orthologs which changed DNA strand  increases with the phylogenetic distance between the compared genomes. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of coding sequences that stay on the leading  strand in all analysed genomes, whereas there are no sequences that stay always  on the lagging strand. Since sequences diverge very fast after switching the DNA  ,  Context:  Directional mutation pressure associated with replication processes is the main  cause of the asymmetry between the leading and lagging DNA strands in bacterial  genomes. On the other hand, the asymmetry between sense and antisense strands of protein coding sequences is a result of both mutation and selection pressures.  Thus, there are two different ways of superposition of the sense strand, on the  leading or lagging strand. Besides many other implications of these two possible situations, one seems to be very important - because of the asymmetric  replication-associated mutation pressure, the mutation rate of genes depends on  their location. Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under  ","7723058, 8411203, 14743977, 15823418","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same.

CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance.

We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant  ,  Context: into dominant (DI-CMT) and recessive types (RI-CMT).

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to provide iodine to the population for different purposes, including protecting against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes in case of nuclear accidents."," Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Metastatic thyroid cancers that are refractory to radioiodine  (iodine-131) are associated with a poor prognosis. In mouse models of thyroid  cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists  increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine.  Their effects in humans are not known. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness  to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation  with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg  twice daily).

Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDH19 (not PCDHGC4).," Context: heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of inherited breast and  ovarian cancer. We reviewed the mutation spectrum in BRCA2-associated FA, and  the spectrum and frequency of BRCA2 mutations in distinct populations. The  rarity of FA due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations supports a fundamental role of  BRCA2 for prevention of malignant transformation during development. The  spectrum of malignancies seen associated with FA support the concept of a tissue  selectivity of BRCA2 mutations for development of FA-associated cancers. This  specificity is illustrated by the distinct FA-associated BRCA2 mutations that  appear to predispose to specific brain or haematological malignancies. For some populations, the number of FA-patients with biallelic BRCA2 disruption is  smaller than that expected from the carrier frequency, and this implies that  some pregnancies with biallelic BRCA2 mutations do not go to term. The apparent discrepancy between expected and observed incidence of BRCA2 mutation-associated  FA in high-frequency carrier populations has important implications for the  genetic counselling of couples with recurrent miscarriages from high-risk  populations.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups.

We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"CRSP/Med complex contains subunits Med220 and Med70, among others."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: the TATA binding protein-associated factors to promote efficient activation of  transcription by Sp1. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that  are shared with other cofactor complexes. Here, we report a detailed  purification protocol for the isolation of CRSP from human HeLa cells. Our  purification strategy takes advantage of the ability of CRSP to bind  Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin as well as other conventional  chromatographic resins. We also describe a streamlined purification protocol  that allows a more rapid and efficient means to isolate active CRSP.  ,  Context: C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin  family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute  inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker  of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that  CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a  native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury  it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells  and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric  subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both  classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q  and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1.

In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli strains and to examine its interaction  with host components that could be related to the infection mechanism.  Recombinant E. coli GAPDH was purified and polyclonal antibodies were obtained.  Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on  the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC  strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external  medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme.  Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional  electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is  secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in  Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC. These  observations indicate that exported GAPDH may act as a virulence factor which  could contribute to EHEC and EPEC pathogenesis.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK activity is linked to SG formation, as pharmacological kinase inhibition interferes with SG formation, and AMPK-α knockdown leads to isoform-specific"," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: induction of new ones that were absent under normal conditions, or the  elimination of others that were normally present. Pointing toward the broad  involvement of different classes of RNAs, many of the newly observed PTMs  differed from those engaged in the known tRNA-based mechanism of translational  recoding, which is induced by oxidative stress. Some of the expression effects  were stress-specific, whereas others were not, thus suggesting that RNA PTMs may  perform multifaceted activities in stress response, which are subjected to  distinctive regulatory pathways. To explore their signaling networks, we  implemented a strategy based on the systematic deletion of genes that connect established response genes with PTM biogenetic enzymes in a putative  interactomic map. The results clearly identified PTMs that were under direct HOG  control, a well-known protein kinase pathway involved in stress response in eukaryotes. Activation of this signaling pathway has been shown to result in the  stabilization of numerous mRNAs and the induction of selected lncRNAs involved  in chromatin remodeling. The fact that PTMs are capable of altering the activity  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP adds adenylyl residues to RNA 3' ends, promoting the stability, export to the cytoplasm, and translation of eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs."," Context: The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their  stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation. Subsequently, the balance  between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of  translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is  essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to  neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A)  polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to  RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the  turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other small RNAs to modulate their stability or biological functions.  ,  Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of  developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: random coil form to the α-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase  K-resistant α-synuclein protein. In contrast with the dogma described above, our  recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also  various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by  DGK isozymes.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,Defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.," Context: addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  and the prominent roles of Ihh in coordinating skeletogenesis, genetic ablation  of Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired  Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast  differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures. Our data  demonstrate that Scube2 plays a key regulatory role in Ihh-dependent  endochondral bone formation.  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ","25639508, 32346735, 34565721, 19625506",Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.,25639508
What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express folate receptor alpha (FRα). It targets FR-positive," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis. There are still  concerns about the long term safety of TNF antagonists in the pediatric age  group and unanswered questions about increased risks of malignancy and  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Through binding to folate receptor-β (FR-β), the new (99m)Tc-EC20  (Etarfolatide) imaging technique detects activated but not resting macrophages  in vivo. The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related  inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole  body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored  blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain  severity.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies. Diffuse  high-grade gliomas represent approximately 10% of pediatric brain tumors. Exon  sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be  seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse  high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. We performed a pyrosequencing-based analysis for the identification of H3F3A codon  27 and codon 34 mutations in 338 pediatric brain tumors. The K27M mutation  occurred in 35 of 129 glioblastomas (27.1%) and in 5 of 28 (17.9%) anaplastic  ,  Context: Annual frequency increased from 11 in 2006 to 55 in 2015. Metastatic brain  tumors accounted for 5.6%, and infratentorial tumors represented 16.3%.  Frequency of the common primary tumors were meningioma (32.9%), glioma (23.8%),  pituitary adenomas (13.5%), and craniopharyngioma (7.5%) (P = 0.001). Vestibular  schwannoma accounted for 1.2%. Meningioma did not have gender difference (P =  0.714). Medulloblastoma, glioma, and craniopharyngioma were the most common  pediatric tumors. About 8.7% presented unconscious (P < 0.001). There was no  significant difference between radiology and histology diagnosis (P = 0.932). CONCLUSION: Meningioma is the most frequent tumor with increasing male incidence, but the frequency of glioma is increasing. Metastasis, acoustic  schwannoma, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors seem to be uncommon. Late  presentation is the rule.  ","27370569, 31151904, 23429371, 29204019",MethPed,27370569
Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,"Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease, also known as Batten disease. In the USA, it is specifically approved for the treatment of motor function loss in pediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CL"," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context:  Human alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22; alpha-Gal A) is the lysosomal  exoglycosidase responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-galactosyl  residues from glycoconjugates and is the defective enzyme causing Fabry disease (McKusick 301500). An unusally elevated level of plasma alpha-Gal A activity (>  2.5 times the normal mean) was detected in two unrelated normal males and the  elevated activities were inherited as X-linked traits in their families. Sequencing of the alpha-Gal A coding region, intron/exon boundaries and  5'-flanking region from the proband identified a single mutation, a G-->A  transition 30 nt upstream from the initiation of translation codon in exon 1.  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections.

Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been used in ophthalmology for the manufacture of eyeglasses. Additionally, it has been used to create custom prosthetic devices, dental implants, and scaffolds for tissue engineering, including bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels"," Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: 3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or  metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional  object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process  contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional  object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in  engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in  printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as  pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue  engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the  recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized  regenerative medicine.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2, as they share a high level of homology, particularly at their carboxy terminus where 130 out of the last 139 amino acids are similar."," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6,  SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol  metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by  regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  ,  Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of laryngeal cancer origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death.

In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 μM and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Epistaxis is a minor complication associated with dental implant placement, specifically when an intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane occurs during the procedure."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome or Broad Thumb-Hallux syndrome is a genetic disorder  characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, and mental deficiency.  A seven-year-old girl had come to the Department of Pedodontics, Istanbul  Medipol University, Faculty of Dentistry, Turkey, with a complaint of caries and  bleeding of gingivae. The patient was mentally retarded. Extraoral features  revealed distinctive facial appearance with a broad fore head, hypertelorism,  broad nasal bridge, and beaked nose. Intraoral features observed were talons  cusps in the upper lateral incisors, carious teeth, and plaque accumulation.  Since the patient was mentally retarded, the dental treatment was done under GA. The treatment plan and dental management of this patient are discussed in this  case report.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ","24155599, 30719578, 22991675, 28030966",Epistaxis is a frequent complication associated with dental implant placement.,"30719578, 24155599"

In fact, the study on AGY was conducted in patients with celiac disease and focused on its potential to improve symptoms and"," Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD.

METHODS: Extracted and summarized applicable studies and reviews from Cochrane  Review, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, IPA, and PubMed.  RESULTS: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for the management of Gaucher  disease. Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over  another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a  lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative  treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however,  these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing  profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy  is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for  symptom management. CONCLUSION: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for treating type 1 Gaucher  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context: is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat prostate cancer, endometriosis-associated pain, and symptoms related to uterine leiomyomas (benign gynecological tumors)."," Context: months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels  within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a  frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well  tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin.

The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids.

Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate the performance of string set matching problem in computational proteomics. The Aho-Corasick algorithm was adapted for execution in FPGA devices, and a VHDL version of a reconfigurable systolic architecture was"," Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman  (SW) algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two  sequences. When searching sequence databases that may contain hundreds of  millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context: and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a  Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible  genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach.

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is as it is not mentioned in the provided context information.," Context: Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules:  proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although  there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical applications, through answering three main questions: (a) What are bacterial  EVs? (b) What are EV impacts on skin inflammatory disease physiopathology? (iii)  What are the possible and expected clinical applications of EVs to treat inflammatory skin diseases?  ,  Context: Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with  severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West  syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and  nonsyndromic epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes.

It also regulates the stability and translation of mRNAs such as GM-CSF, IL-2, c-myc, c-fos, and GLUT1 by"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human  fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also  decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. We therefore postulated that AMPK  activation in human fibroblasts might contribute to the implementation of the  senescence phenotype through mechanisms that included a reduction in HuR cytoplasmic presence. Indeed, AMP:ATP ratios were 2-3-fold higher in senescent  fibroblasts compared with young fibroblasts. Accordingly, in vitro senescence  was accompanied by a marked elevation in AMPK activity. Evidence that increased  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic  overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  ,  Context:  ELAV proteins are implicated in regulating the stability and translation of  cytokine and growth regulatory mRNAs such as GM-CSF, IL-2, c-myc, c-fos and  GLUT1 by binding to their AU-rich 3'UTRs. The tissue-specific ELAV protein HuB (aka. Hel-N1) is predominantly cytoplasmic and has been shown to stabilize GLUT1  and c-myc mRNAs and to increase their translation following ectopic expression  in 3T3-L1 cells. We report that the most widely expressed mouse ELAV protein, mHuA, is predominately nuclear in cultured NIH-3T3 cells, but is localized in  the cytoplasm during early G1 of the cell cycle. Therefore, much like the  primarily cytoplasmic HuB, HuA becomes temporally localized in the cytoplasm  ","19884656, 12730239, 20007147, 9763509","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization in budding yeast, suggesting that it plays a significant role in nucleosome positioning."," Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and  previous attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide  distribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology. In particular,  the precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been  controversial. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of  hitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5 bp periodicity, and poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome  landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our  computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to  other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo  nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: Silencing and position-effect (PE) variegation (PEV), which is due to  integration of viral vectors in heterochromatin regions, are considered  significant obstacles to obtaining a consistent level of transgene expression in  gene therapy. The inclusion of chromatin insulators into vectors has been  proposed to counteract this position-dependent variegation of transgene  expression. Here, we show that the sea urchin chromatin insulator, sns5, protects a recombinant gamma-retroviral vector from the negative influence of  chromatin in erythroid milieu. This element increases the probability of vector  expression at different chromosomal integration sites, which reduces both silencing and PEV.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, according to the provided information, desmin is a muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, and its presence is mentioned only in relation to muscle cells, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles. There is no mention of desmin being present"," Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: able to control C. elegans larval development, by specifically targeting the  3'UTR of lin-14 and lin-28, respectively. These findings have introduced a novel  and wide layer of complexity in the regulation of mRNA and protein expression.  Lin-4 and let-7 are now considered the founding members of an abundant class of  small fine-tuned RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), in viruses, green algae,  plants, flies, worms, and in mammals. In humans, the estimated number of genes  encoding for miRNAs is as high as 1000 and around 30% of the protein-coding  genes are post-transcriptionally controlled by miRNAs. This article reviews the  role of miRNAs in regulating several biological responses in muscle cells, ranging from proliferation, differentiation and adaptation to stress cues.  Cardiac and skeletal muscles are powerful examples to summarize the activity of  miRNAs in cell fate specification, lineage differentiation and metabolic pathways. Indeed, specific miRNAs control the number of proliferating muscle  progenitors to guarantee the proper formation of the heart and muscle fibers and  to assure the self-renewal of muscle progenitors during adult tissue  ,  Context: Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate  filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in  the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific  fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest  impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. To determine whether altered  capillary function or an intrinsic cardiomyocyte defect is responsible for  desmin null DCM, transgenic mice were generated to rescue desmin expression  specifically to cardiomyocytes. Desmin rescue mice display a wild-type cardiac phenotype with no fibrosis or calcification in the myocardium and normalization  of coronary flow. Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is also restored to normal.  Markers of hypertrophy upregulated in desmin null hearts return to wild-type levels in desmin rescue mice.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context:  Ubiquitin E3 ligases including SCF complex are key regulators of cell cycle.  Here, we show that Mis18β, a component of Mis18 complex governing CENP-A  localization, is a new substrate of βTrCP-containing SCF complex. βTrCP interacted with Mis18β exclusively during interphase but not during mitosis and  mediated proteasomal degradation of Mis18β leading to the inactivation of Mis18  complex during interphase. In addition, uncontrolled stabilization of Mis18β caused cell death. Together, we propose that βTrCP-mediated regulation of Mis18β  stability is a mechanism to restrict centromere function of Mis18 complex from  late mitosis to early G1 phase.  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: but knowledge of the mechanisms by which they act is still surprisingly limited,  and claims that almost the entirety of the mammalian genome is transcribed into  functional noncoding transcripts remain controversial. At the same time, a small  number of well-studied lncRNAs have given us important clues about the biology  of these molecules, and a few key functional and mechanistic themes have begun  to emerge, although the robustness of these models and classification schemes  remains to be seen. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA  field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological  functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs. We also reflect on how the recent interest in lncRNAs is deeply rooted in biology's longstanding concern  with the evolution and function of genomes.

The words of this new class are minimal in the sense  that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful for applications that require a richer variety of absent words.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3.," Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection.

A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants,  identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system.

Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, which are involved in cancer progression. Additionally, saracatinib induces G(1)"," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts.

RESULTS: AZD0530 was generally safe and well tolerated across doses. One subject  receiving 125 mg of AZD0530 was discontinued from the study due to the  development of congestive heart failure and atypical pneumonia, which were  considered possibly related to the study drug. Plasma/CSF ratio of AZD0530 was  0.4. The 100 mg and 125 mg doses achieved CSF drug levels corresponding to brain  levels that rescued memory deficits in transgenic mouse models. One-month  treatment with AZD0530 had no significant effect on clinical efficacy measures or regional cerebral glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with  mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg.

Additionally, it also acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and inhibits"," Context: hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: cancer (CRPC)--in those who are chemotherapy-naive and those previously treated  with docetaxel. Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent  disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile. Besides CYP17  inhibition, abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and  inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase--two effects that potentially  contribute to its antitumour effects. However, the inhibition of the 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11B1 and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes  leads to adverse effects and toxicities that include secondary mineralocorticoid  excess. Abiraterone is also associated with increased incidence of cardiac disorders. Under such circumstances, development of new CYP17 inhibitors as an  additional line of defence is urgently needed. To achieve enhanced clinical  benefits, new strategies are being explored that include selective inhibition of  ","24501545, 23199349, 22291466, 24276076","Abiraterone acts by inhibiting cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1), a critical step in androgen biosynthesis, thus leading to inhibition of androgen biosynthesis.","21860772, 22291466, 9876107, 23344012, 23199349, 22672122"
Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context: characteristic facies and deafness. The second case is an example of  Waardenburg's type I (with dystopia canthorum) with complete iris heterochromia  and characteristic facies. Bilateral glaucoma was also present in the second  case. Previously unrecognized details of iris architecture in Waardenburg's  syndrome are described. Pigmentation anomalies of the skin are also discussed.  It is hypothesized that the ocular pigmentary disturbance in Waardenburg's  syndrome is widespread and involves the hyperchromic as well as the hypochromic  areas of the eyes. A possible association with glaucoma might be explained by  such a hypothesis.  ,  Context: peripheral visual field testing. DESIGN: Prospective controlled case series. PARTICIPANTS: 19 subjects with strabismic amblyopia with visual acuities between  20/400 and 20/40 in their affected eyes were recruited to the study. Fellow  non-amblyopic eyes served as the control group. METHODS: Visual acuity in both eyes was assessed using a projected Snellen eye  chart with two NDFs (0.4 and 3.0 densities). Visual fields were assessed using a  Humphrey perimeter using one NDF (0.4 density). Best corrected visual acuity and  visual fields were also recorded. RESULTS: When using a 3.0 NDF, visual acuity was reduced in all eyes (p < 0.0001). When using a 0.4 NDF, visual acuity was significantly improved in eyes  with strabismic amblyopia compared to unfiltered conditions (p = 0.0011). There  was no significant effect by NDFs on visual field testing in eyes with strabismic amblyopia or fellow non-amblyopic eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Neutral density filters affect eyes with strabismic amblyopia  differently than they do non-amblyopic eyes.

The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone regulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. However, there is no explicit mention of thyronamines' effects on fat tissue in the provided context information."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: adipokine levels. The effects of these interventions depend on weight loss per  se, changes in fat distribution without weight loss and/or direct effects on  adipose tissue inflammation.Weight loss, as a result of diet, pharmacology and  surgery, positively influences plasma adipokines and systemic inflammation.  Several classes of drugs influence systemic inflammation directly through their  anti-inflammatory actions. PPAR-γ agonism positively influences adipose tissue  inflammation in several classes of intervention such as the thiazolidinediones  and perhaps salicylates, CB1-antagonists and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  Furthermore, within drug classes there are differential effects of individual pharmacologic agents on adipose tissue function.It can be concluded that several  commonly used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have  unintended influences on adipose tissue function. Improving adipose tissue function may contribute to reducing the risk of vascular diseases and the  development of type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The modification of H3 in asynchronous HeLa cells was profiled using Top Down  Mass Spectrometry. A broad distribution of species differing by 14 Da and  containing less than 3% unmodified protein was observed for all three variants.  Species of up to +168 Da were observed for H3.1, and fragmentation of all  species by Electron Capture Dissociation (ECD) revealed approximately 5%  methylation of K4 and approximately 50% dimethylation of K9. K14 and K23 were  major sites of acetylation. H3.3 was slightly hypermodified with the apex of the  distribution shifted by approximately +14 Da compared to H3.1. H3.1 (50% and  15%) from colchicine-treated cells was monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated, respectively, with equivalent modification of S10 and S28.  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.  ,  Context: histones, a Vps75 dimer bound to a histone H3-H4 tetramer predominates. We show  the Vps75-H3-H4 interaction is compatible with the histone chaperone Asf1 and  deduce a structural model of the Vps75-Asf1-H3-H4 (VAH) co-chaperone complex  using the Pulsed Electron-electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) technique and  cross-linking MS/MS distance restraints. The model provides a molecular basis  for the involvement of both Vps75 and Asf1 in Rtt109 catalysed histone H3 K9  acetylation. In the absence of Asf1 this model can be used to generate a complex  consisting of a reconfigured Vps75 tetramer bound to a H3-H4 tetramer. This  provides a structural explanation for many of the complexes detected biochemically and illustrates the ability of Vps75 to interact with dimeric or  tetrameric H3-H4 using the same interaction surface.

In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are  components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

Small interfering RNA- and pharmacology-based analysis showed that  although both mTORC1 and mTORC2 contribute to proliferation, only mTORC2 is required for ATP generation and survival of idiopathic PAH PAVSMCs. mTORC2  downregulated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase, which led to  activation of mTORC1-S6 and increased proliferation, as well as a deficiency of the proapoptotic protein Bim and idiopathic PAH PAVSMC survival.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen  (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated  ,  Context:  Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National  Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is involved in autoimmune thyroid disease.

Additionally,"," Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid  disease (AITD) and it has been calculated that 80% of the susceptibility to  develop Graves' disease is attributable to genes. The concordance rate for AITD  among monozygotic twins is, however, well below 1 and environmental factors thus  must play an important role. We have attempted to carry out a comprehensive  review of all the environmental and hormonal risk factors thought to bring about  AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and  deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive  span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking, radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a  role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain  drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland. Further research is  warranted into the importance of fetal microchimerism and of viral infections  capable of mounting an endogenous interferon-alpha response.  ,  Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  ,  Context: Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except  nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in  the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. It is unclear how operons have become  abundant in nematode genomes. The ""one-way street"" hypothesis asserts that once  formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage  would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C.  elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and  Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with  experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic  analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including  ,  Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons. We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the  plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: improved cardiac function, and decreased infarct sizes in diabetic mice.  Notably, co-treatment of homoharringtonine (HHT), a selective inhibitor of  ribosomal function, totally blocked NS-mediated cardioprotective effects against  I/R injury. Furthermore, in cultured cardiomyocytes, saturated fatty acids  treatment, but not high glucose exposure, significantly inhibited simulated  I/R-induced NS upregulation and ribosomal function improvement. In conclusion,  these data for the first time demonstrate that NS dysregulation induced by  saturated fatty acids exposure might be an important cause of increased ischemic  vulnerability to I/R injury in diabetic hearts. Targeting NS dysregulation and subsequent ribosomal dysfunction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for  diabetic I/R injury management.  ,  Context: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a critical role in mediating cardiac  contractility and its function is abnormal in the diabetic heart. However, the  mechanisms underlying SR dysfunction in the diabetic heart are not clear.  Because protein phosphorylation regulates SR function, this study examined the  phosphorylation state of phospholamban, a key SR protein that regulates SR  calcium (Ca2+) uptake in the heart. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by an injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg kg(-1) i.v.), and the animals  were humanely killed after 6 weeks and cardiac SR function was examined.  Depressed cardiac performance was associated with reduced SR Ca2+-uptake activity in diabetic animals. The reduction in SR Ca2+-uptake was consistent  with a significant decrease in the level of SR Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2a)  protein.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.," Context: FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These  functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems,  ,  Context: attention for their potential roles in insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.  FTY720/fingolimod, a prodrug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is  phosphorylated in vivo to its active phosphorylated form by sphingosine kinase 2  and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide  biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks  of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development, as part of the organizational hierarchy of the genome, alongside other architectural proteins such as Cohesin and CTCF."," Context: BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic chromosomal components, especially histones, are subject  to a wide array of covalent modifications and catalytic reorganization. These  modifications have an important role in the regulation of chromatin structure  and are mediated by large multisubunit complexes that contain modular proteins  with several conserved catalytic and noncatalytic adaptor domains. RESULTS: Using computational sequence-profile analysis methods, we identified a  previously uncharacterized, predicted alpha-helical domain of about 85 residues  in chromosomal proteins such as Swi3p, Rsc8p, Moira and several other  uncharacterized proteins. This module, termed the SWIRM domain, is predicted to mediate specific protein-protein interactions in the assembly of  chromatin-protein complexes. In one group of proteins, which are highly  conserved throughout the crown-group eukaryotes, the SWIRM domain is linked to a catalytic domain related to the monoamine and polyamine oxidases. Another human  protein has the SWIRM domain linked to a JAB domain that is involved in protein  degradation through the ubiquitin pathway.  ,  Context: The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene  expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand  the link between genome organization and function. Yet, the factors involved and  the mechanisms by which the 3D organization of the nucleus is established remain  poorly understood. The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based  approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural  proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins  orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of  interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their  co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D  chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene  expression.  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  The interaction of proteins with chromatin is fundamental for several essential  cellular processes. During the development of an organism, genes must to be  tightly regulated both temporally and spatially. This is achieved through the action of chromatin-binding proteins such as transcription factors, histone  modifiers, nucleosome remodelers, and lamins. Furthermore, protein-DNA  interactions are important in the adult, where their perturbation can lead to disruption of homeostasis, metabolic dysregulation, and diseases such as cancer.  Understanding the nature of these interactions is of paramount importance in  almost all areas of molecular biological research.

It is a very rare condition and only  anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the possible association of colistin and tubulopathy.
