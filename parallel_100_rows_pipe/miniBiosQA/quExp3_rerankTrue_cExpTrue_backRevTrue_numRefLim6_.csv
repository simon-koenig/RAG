What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.

Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors.

Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.  ,  Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that they encode mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions, suggesting a potential role in cell proliferation and genome regulation."," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"In the highest tertile (>426 hours) of cumulative use, a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2 (95% confidence interval = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma, indicating an increased"," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours.

CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was  observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to  earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,The No Promoter Left Behind method can be applied to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.," Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context: Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is characterized by  intracranial hypertension of unknown etiology typically in obese women <45 years  of age, and can be disabling secondary to headaches and visual disturbances.  Medical management includes pharmaceuticals that reduce cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) production and lumbar punctures that reduce the CSF volume, both aimed at  reducing intracranial pressure. When medical management fails, surgical CSF  diverting procedures are indicated. Recently it has been demonstrated that dural  sinus stenosis or thrombosis can be responsible for this disease and treated  with endovascular venous stent placement. The intent of this educational manuscript is to review the clinical presentation of pseudotumor cerebri  patients and discuss the medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment options  for this disease. After reading this paper, the reader should be able to: (1) understand the pathophysiological basis of pseudotumor cerebri, (2) describe its  presenting signs and symptoms, and (3) discuss the medical, surgical, and  endovascular treatment options.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Whether routine screening for depression among nonpregnant women  of reproductive age improves identification and treatment of the disorder  remains unclear.

In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain  barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM.

The small interface between the Notch  ankyrin domains could accommodate DNA bending and untwisting to allow a range of  spacer lengths between the two sites. Cooperative dimerization occurred on the  human and mouse Hes5 promoters at a sequence that diverged from the CSL-binding  consensus at one of the sites.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. It associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques.

Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the  ,  Context: Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).," Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The  NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95%  CI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.  INTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement  score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered  breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal  recording. FUNDING: Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne, Lausanne  University Hospital, Swiss National Science Foundation, Leenaards Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline, and Vaud Pulmonary League.  ,  Context: for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI  ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a  sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight  recordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low  availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is  recommended.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep typically reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection.

However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  ,  Context: provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.  ,  Context: A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection.

Which package is available for analysing genomic interactions in R/Bioconductor?,r3Cseq," Context: The coupling of chromosome conformation capture (3C) with next-generation  sequencing technologies enables the high-throughput detection of long-range  genomic interactions, via the generation of ligation products between DNA  sequences, which are closely juxtaposed in vivo. These interactions involve  promoter regions, enhancers and other regulatory and structural elements of  chromosomes and can reveal key details of the regulation of gene expression.  3C-seq is a variant of the method for the detection of interactions between one  chosen genomic element (viewpoint) and the rest of the genome.

The package reads a common aligned  read input format, provides data normalization, allows the visualization of  candidate interaction regions and detects statistically significant chromatin interactions, thus greatly facilitating hypothesis generation and the  interpretation of experimental results. We further demonstrate its use on a  series of real-world applications.  ,  Context: 'triplex'.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails.

Recent methodologies have enabled in-depth  characterization of circRNAs for identification and potential functions.  CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA.

It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region. We report a rare case occurring in  the mandible of a 14-year-old boy who presented with considerable expansion and displacement of teeth.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare but well-known complication of hemophilia  manifesting as recurrent hemorrhage and progressive enlargement of hematoma. A  patient with severe hemophilia has 1% to 2% chance to develop pseudotumor. The chronic pressure of osseous hemorrhage usually results in bone destruction or  resorption. Cranial hemophilic pseudotumors are extremely rare, with only 7  reported cases associated with mild or moderate factor VIII or IX deficiency.

The prevalence  of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It  seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger  E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date,  over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.

X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,"TRalpha2 regulates several tri-iodothyronine (T3)-regulated genes in the heart, specifically in the right atrium (RA), left ventricular wall (LVW), and apex."," Context: OBJECTIVE: In view of their different actions on thyroid hormone receptor (TR)  isoforms we set out to investigate whether amiodarone (AM) and dronedarone  (Dron) have different and/or component-specific effects on cardiac gene  expression.  DESIGN: Rats were treated with AM or Dron and the expression of TRalpha 1,  TRalpha 2, TRbeta 1 and several tri-iodothyronine (T3)-regulated genes was  studied in different parts of the heart, namely the right atrium (RA), left ventricular wall (LVW) and apex. METHODS: Rats were treated for 14 days with 100 mg/kg body weight AM or Dron.  The expression of TRalpha 1, TRalpha 2, TRbeta 1 and T3-regulated genes was studied using real-time PCR and non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. RESULTS: AM and Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing  TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50%. In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The  results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the  balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.

The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.

This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation are MEC-17 (acetyltransferase), SIRT2 (deacetylase), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6, also a deacetyl"," Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase.

In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context: for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context:  Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the  ,  Context: invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules.," Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: most of which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression.  Genome-wide maps of open chromatin regions can facilitate functional analysis of  cis- and trans-regulatory elements via their connections with trait-associated  sequence variants. Currently, Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with  high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is considered the most accessible and  cost-effective strategy for genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility.  Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) technology has also been developed to study  cell type-specific chromatin accessibility in tissue samples containing a  heterogeneous cellular population. However, due to the intrinsic nature of scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of  biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult.  To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there  is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this  review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from  ,  Context: unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. In this  regard, we found that DNA sequences at RNA splice sites are hypersensitive to  digestion by MNase but not by MPE-Fe(II). This phenomenon may have affected the  analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively  indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the  genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. In  particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification  of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the  regulation of gene expression.  ,  Context: regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely  used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more  continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict  chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq.  Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer  better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell  RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility  than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq  increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples  with limited cell numbers.

It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer  according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility.

The discovery of the  androgen receptor (AR) gene and related genes has expanded the knowledge on the  genetics of hair loss. These basic science studies, combined with more recent  clinical studies, have led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AGA  in both men and women. These genetic advances have also led to the development  of a new screening test for AGA. Recently, in addition to the two currently  approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medications (minoxidil and  finasteride), a novel device was FDA-approved for the treatment of hair loss, the laser hair comb. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy and  validity of the genetic screening test and the efficacy of the laser hair comb.  ,  Context: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) resulting from the deficiency of the C1 inhibitor  protein is a rare disease, characterized by paroxysms of edema formation in the  subcutis and in the submucosa. Edema can cause obstruction of the upper airway,  which may lead to suffocation. Prompt elimination of edema is necessary to save  patients from this life-threatening condition. Essentially, these edematous  attacks are related to the activation of the kinin-kallikrein system and the  consequent release of bradykinin.

This is the only agent approved recently by the FDA for all localizations of edematous HAE attacks. Its advantages include no risk of viral  contamination, high selectivity, very rapid onset of action, good tolerability,  and straightforward subcutaneous administration. Owing to the risk of anaphylaxis, ecallantide should be administered by a health care professional. A  postmarketing survey to improve risk-assessment and risk-minimization has been  launched.

However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at  late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase.

To correct the splice defect, we developed  a gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 small nuclear RNA (U1). U1  is required for SDS recognition of pre-mRNAs and initiates the splice process. The mutation described herein interferes with the recognition of the SDS by U1.  To overcome the deleterious effects of the mutation, we generated four U1  isoforms with increasing complementarity to the SDS. Lentiviral particles were used to transduce patient-derived fibroblasts with these U1 variants. Full  complementarity of U1 corrects the splice defect partially and increases  recognition of the mutant SDS. The therapeutic effect is U1-concentration  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context:  Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies.

White-wheat bread was used as a  reference meal in both studies.  RESULTS: The lactic acid in the fermented milk products did not lower the  glycemic and insulinemic indexes. Despite low glycemic indexes of 15-30, all of  the milk products produced high insulinemic indexes of 90-98, which were not  significantly different from the insulinemic index of the reference bread.  Addition of fermented milk (yogurt) and pickled cucumber to a breakfast with a  high-glycemic index bread significantly lowered postprandial glycemia and insulinemia compared with the reference meal. In contrast, addition of regular  milk and fresh cucumber had no favorable effect on the metabolic responses. CONCLUSIONS: Milk products appear insulinotropic as judged from 3-fold to 6-fold higher insulinemic indexes than expected from the corresponding glycemic  indexes. The presence of organic acids may counteract the insulinotropic effect  of milk in mixed meals.  ,  Context: packaging that could interfere with endocrine function. Too little is known yet  about the toxicology of bisphenol A substitutes. Several studies have shown that  exposure to bisphenol A in adults and children can be greatly reduced by  choosing a varied diet based on fresh foods, and by avoiding the use of plastic  tableware. To reduce exposure to bisphenol A and other chemicals with hormonal  activity that are present in food packaging, it seems reasonable to encourage  the consumption of fresh foods, avoiding canned food and plastic packaging for  storing and reheating food and beverages. These precautionary measures are most  important for food and beverages intended for pregnant women and young children.  ,  Context: To evaluate the effect on longevity of a diet that is concurrent with common  dietary guidelines, a simple diet scoring system was developed and applied in a  follow-up study of 2,820 middle-aged Dutch civil servants and their spouses. In  the early 1950s those civil servants were seen for a health examination that  included a dietary survey. Consumption frequency data of the quantitatively most  important food items at that time were used for the diet scoring. Overall  survival after 25 years was 46.8% among men and 68.6% among women. In men, a  significant positive association between prudent diet score and 25-year,  age-adjusted survival could be demonstrated. Of the 10 food items that constituted the diet score, a higher intake of brown bread, porridge and/or  yogurt, vegetables, fish, and fruit was associated with a slightly better  survival. In a separate analysis we had found a significant inverse relationship between coffee consumption and survival. A similar trend, which, however, was  not significant, was observed for alcohol intake.

White-wheat bread was used as a  reference meal in both studies. RESULTS: The lactic acid in the fermented milk products did not lower the  glycemic and insulinemic indexes. Despite low glycemic indexes of 15-30, all of  the milk products produced high insulinemic indexes of 90-98, which were not significantly different from the insulinemic index of the reference bread.

The concentration of urinary iodine (UI) was  measured at 0, 4, 12, 25, and 50 wk, whereas thyroid volume and serum  thyrotropin and free thyroxine concentrations were measured at 0, 25, and 50 wk. RESULTS: UI was higher in all treatment groups than in the placebo group, except  at baseline. UI in the P200 group was not significantly different from that in  the PS400 group at all times of measurement. In a comparison of preparations  supplying 400 mg I conducted by using a mathematical model, iodine retention  from the peanut oil preparation was 3 times that from the poppy seed oil, and the protection period for peanut oil was twice as long as that for the poppy  seed oil (P < 0.001 for both). The reduction in thyroid volume was greater in  the treatment groups than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). No significant differences in serum hormone concentrations were observed between groups before  or after treatment.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: individual and/or having more than one affected offspring, were enrolled in the  project. Prior to this project, the families had been evaluated using a  next-generation sequencing panel including 16 DEE genes in a previous study;  however, no molecular diagnosis could be established. In five cases from the  three selected DEEs families in our study, the genetic etiology was investigated  using WES. RESULTS: All patients in the study group had infantile onset epileptic seizures;  however, semiologies varied. All patients presented with severe developmental  delay. WES revealed biallelic disease causing mutations in DENDD5A, GRN, and  TBCD genes in family 1, family 2, and family 3, respectively. In each family, the identified variants associated with the disease were segregated. Reverse  phenotyping supported the molecular analysis. CONCLUSION: This study provided a valuable contribution to the genotype-phenotype relationship by determining rare epilepsy syndromes in  undiagnosed patients previously. WES is a useful diagnostic alternative,  particularly in consanguineous families.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections.

Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD.

We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults.

Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43  to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that  cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress  granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs  in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in  neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus,  understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the  role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration.

Although they lack catalytic activity, PABPs have several roles in mediating  gene expression. Nuclear PABPs are necessary for the synthesis of the poly(A)  tail, regulating its ultimate length and stimulating maturation of the mRNA.  Association with PABP is also a requirement for some mRNAs to be exported from the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, PABPs facilitate the formation of the 'closed  loop' structure of the messenger ribonucleoprotein particle that is crucial for  additional PABP activities that promote translation initiation and termination, recycling of ribosomes, and stability of the mRNA. Collectively, these  sequential nuclear and cytoplasmic contributions comprise a cycle in which PABPs  and the poly(A) tail first create and then eliminate a network of cis- acting  ,  Context: The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their  stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation. Subsequently, the balance  between exonucleolytic deadenylation and selective re-establishment of  translation-competent poly(A) tails by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases is  essential for the appropriate regulation of gene expression from oocytes to  neurons. In recent years, surprising roles for cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase-related enzymes that add uridylyl, rather than adenylyl, residues to  RNA 3' ends have also emerged. These terminal uridylyl transferases promote the  turnover of certain mRNAs but also modify microRNAs, their precursors and other small RNAs to modulate their stability or biological functions.  ,  Context: PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively  studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly  defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism  and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa  and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect  on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as  observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In  addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected  cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated  p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: several functions; however, the mechanism by which they directly regulate  nuclear functions remains unknown. PIPKIs regulate cellular functions through  interactions with protein partners, often PtdIns4,5P2 effectors, that target  PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and  temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P2 required for the regulation of specific  signalling pathways. Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P2 we  set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha.  Here we show that PIPKIalpha co-localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with  a newly identified non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which we have termed Star-PAP (nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIalpha regulated-poly(A) polymerase) and  that the activity of Star-PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P2.  Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha function together in a complex to control the expression of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme  haem oxygenase-1 (refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by  regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data  ","20174964, 12844354, 23989958, 23300856, 9790974, 18288197","Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted post-translational regulation.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally will not take up sterols from the environment  under aerobic conditions. A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted  transcriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that  allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was  ,  Context: whole-genome duplication. Detection and study of duplications are usually based  on sequence alignment, synteny and phylogenetic techniques, but protein domains  are also useful in assessing protein homology. We develop a simple and  computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on  the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and  the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the  yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD  paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard  functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a  common set of ""duplicable"" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs  tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the  existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with  largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the  ,  Context: bound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose  promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol  biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal  subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6,  SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p.

Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,"HEp-2 cells are laryngeal cancer cells, as they were used to establish a laryngeal xenografted tumor model by inoculating them in nude mice."," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation.

Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration.

It effectively and specifically inhibits," Context: Self-splicing of group I intron from the 26S rRNA of Candida albicans is  essential for maturation of the host RNA. Here, we demonstrated that the  co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense  oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron. The  core-targeted AON effectively and specifically inhibited the intron splicing  from its host RNA in living C. albicans. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments showed that the growth inhibition was caused by a fungicidal effect. For the  first time, we showed that an AON targeting the ribozyme core folding  specifically inhibits the endogenous ribozyme splicing in living cells and specifically kills the intron-containing fungal strains, which sheds light on  the development of antifungal drugs in the future.  ,  Context: in lymphocyte cell cultures using light or fluorescent microscopy.

One missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a  conserved region among the cohort of 19 patients. A H558R polymorphism was  detected on the same allele. Unlike the other 18 patients who each developed 1-2  VF episodes during acute MI, the mutation carrier developed six episodes of  VT/VF within the first 12 hours. All VT/VF episodes were associated with ST  segment changes and were initiated by short-coupled extrasystoles. We describe  the first sodium channel mutation to be associated with the development of an  arrhythmic storm during acute ischemia. These findings suggest that a loss of function in SCN5A may predispose to ischemia induced arrhythmic storm.

We found that the O. minuta homologues of PER1, GUP1 and CWH43  are functionally compatible with those of S. cerevisiae. Disruption of GUP1 or  CWH43 in O. minuta caused a growth defect under non-permissive conditions. The  O. minuta per1Δ mutant exhibited a more fragile phenotype than the gup1Δ or  cwh43Δ mutants. To address the role of GPI modification in O. minuta, we  assessed the effect of these mutations on the processing and localization of the  O. minuta homologues of the Gas1 protein; in S. cerevisiae, Gas1p is an abundant  and well-characterized GPI-anchored protein. We found that O. minuta possesses  two copies of the GAS1 gene, which we designate GAS1A and GAS1B. Microscopy and western blotting analysis showed mislocalization and/or lower retention of  Gas1Ap and Gas1Bp within the membrane fraction in per1Δ or gup1Δ mutant cells,  suggesting the significance of lipid remodelling for GPI-anchored proteins in O. minuta. Localization behaviour of Gas1Bp differed from that of Gas1Ap.

Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE)  elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is  recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the  complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and  translation of its ligand message. We have previously demonstrated that HuR is  constitutively expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells and shuttles from the nucleus to the cytosol, but remains predominantly nuclear in the preadipocytes and that as  the cells differentiate, there is a marked increase in the proportion of HuR in  the cytosol at any time. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is also expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine  HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic  ,  Context: Regulated gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in higher eukaryotes  is based on a network of interactions among RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)  operating within multifactorial ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, notably  heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and mRNP complexes. We are  interested in interactions involving hnRNP proteins participating in several  steps of mRNA processing (mainly pre-mRNA splicing) and HuR with an established  role in stability/translation of associated mRNAs. hnRNP and HuR proteins have a  major nucleoplasmic localization and ability to shuttle between nucleus and  cytoplasm. We report here on interactions between hnRNP and HuR proteins that were identified in the context of isolated hnRNP and mRNP complexes. This was  done by the application of immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays on different  sub-cellular fractions prepared from cells of human and mouse origin, as well as in vivo localization studies. A range of specific associations of HuR with the  shuttling hnRNP A1 and A3 and the non-shuttling hnRNP C1/C2 was identified and  ascribed discrete properties with respect to stability to RNase A and increasing  ","23223443, 19884656, 23401122, 16639702, 19884656, 19931428","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"According to recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization, the DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. However, another study suggests that the cutting preference of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) in combination with size"," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome.

This chapter provides detailed guidelines for the preparation of Hi-C sequencing libraries for bacteria.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial  role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies  (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of  topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose suspension vaccine.," Context:  Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions.

With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral  ,  Context: DATA SYNTHESIS: Approval of Vaxchora, was based on efficacy of the vaccine in  human trials demonstrating 90.3% protection among those challenged with V  cholerae 10 days after vaccination and in immunogenicity studies with 90%  systemic vibriocidal antibody conversion at 6 months after a single-dose of  vaccine. Tolerability was acceptable, with the most common adverse effects  reported to be fatigue, headache, and abdominal pain.  CONCLUSION: Vaxchora is the only FDA-approved, single-dose oral vaccine for the  prevention of cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1 in adult travelers from  the United States going to cholera-affected areas. Safety and efficacy has not been established in children, immunocompromised persons, and pregnant or  breastfeeding women or those living in cholera-endemic areas.  ,  Context: efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and  exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were  strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally  downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a  moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus,  demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for  economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced  again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10,  2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and  man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera  vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need.  ,  Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection.

Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone analogues, such as thyronamines, may have neural routes that exist for their action on metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  Thyronamines T(0)AM and T(1)AM are naturally occurring decarboxylated thyroid  hormone derivatives. Their in vivo administration induces effects opposite to  those induced by thyroid hormone, including lowering of body temperature. Since the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential  target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro  effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v.

Of  the two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 is by far the best characterized. When active, mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in TPOAb concentrations. Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free  thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality  of life estimation. Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: protection from oxidative damage. Selenium content in selenium-sensitive tissues  such as the liver, kidney or muscle and expression of nonessential  selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases GPx1 and GPx3, is controlled  by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women.

As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.  ,  Context:  Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four  modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM).

We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: norfloxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, ciprofloxacin), 15 beta-lactam or  cephalosporin antibiotics (cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam,  cefdinir, cefoperazone, cefpiramide, cefamandole, cefixime, ceftibuten,  cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin).

CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of  Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira  guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus  callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are  presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of  microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our  knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.  ,  Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in  the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740 g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the  possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported.
