What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that STAG3, a germinal cell-specific protein, is involved in meiosis and sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  ,  Context: STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement  of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin  complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear.

Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 regulates alpha-MyHC transcription in the heart.," Context: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and its mRNA have been identified in the rat  heart, and TRH can enhance cardiomyocyte contractility in vivo. At present,  little is known about cardiac TRH gene transcriptional regulation in the heart.  Hormones and neurotransmitters, including thyroid hormone (T3), glucocorticoids,  testosterone, and 5-HT initiate effects not only in the cardiovascular system,  but also in the regulation of hypothalamic TRH. To clarify the potential roles  of these modulators upon the cardiac TRH gene transcription, rat TRH promoter  activity was assessed in rat embryonic myocyte cells (H9C2) by transient  transfection assays. TRH promoter activity was stimulated significantly by dexamethasone (10(-4) M) and testosterone (10(-5) M), and was inhibited by T3  (10(-7) M). Interestingly, the neurotransmitter 5-HT stimulated TRH promoter  activity in H9C2 cells, but not in HTB-11 cells. To further clarify this selective role of 5-HT on TRH promoter transcriptional activity in cardiac  cells, 5-HT receptor antagonists and agonists were tested. A selective 5-HT2  receptor antagonist blocked 5-HT stimulation, whereas 5-HT agonist analogs  ,  Context: upregulated in models with a hyperthyroid-like phenotype, TH (triiodothyronine,  T3), in culture and exercise in vivo. In myocyte culture, TR overexpression, or  excess T3, reversed the effects of phenylephrine on TH-responsive mRNAs and  promoters. In addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the  TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR  isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, and  TRalpha1 to alpha-MyHC transcription and increased myocyte size. We conclude  that TR isoforms have distinct regulation and function in rat cardiac myocytes.  Changes in myocyte TR levels can explain in part the characteristic molecular phenotypes in physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","There is no explicit connection mentioned between isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, it is mentioned that isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure, which might be related to dilated cardiomyopathy"," Context:  Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disease that is likely to  develop in the embryonic period. It is caused by the intrauterine arrest of the  myocardial compaction process in the beginning of the fetal development. It is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep intertrabecular  recesses, as well as the thickening of the myocardium into two distinct layers  (compacted and not compacted). Even though this disease is said to be prevalent in the pediatric population or together with congenital heart disease, one can  understand that this disease occurs in isolation, because the diagnosis is  becoming more common in adult patients that have no other heart disease.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by counteracting DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase through its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. This interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, likely by CDK/DDK"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1  regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric  ","24656819, 24879017","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,"I am uncertain about the answer as there is no mention of mutational biases or directional mutation pressure in the provided contexts. The contexts only discuss nucleic acid analogues and posttranslational modifications, but do not provide information on mutational biases or"," Context: Nucleic acids analogues, i.e., oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates and  N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidates, containing 3'-amino-3'-deoxy nucleosides with  various 2'-substituents were synthesized and extensively studied. These  compounds resist nuclease hydrolysis and form stable duplexes with complementary  native phosphodiester DNA and, particularly, RNA strands. An increase in  duplexes' melting temperature, DeltaT(m), relative to their phosphodiester  counterparts, reaches 2.2-4.0 degrees per modified nucleoside. 2'-OH-  (RNA-like), 2'-O-Me-, and 2'-ribo-F-nucleoside substitutions result in the  highest degree of duplex stabilization. Moreover, under close to physiological salt and pH conditions, the 2'-deoxy- and 2'-fluoro-phosphoramidate compounds  form extremely stable triple-stranded complexes with either single- or  double-stranded phosphodiester DNA oligonucleotides. Melting temperature, T(m), of these triplexes exceeds T(m) values for the isosequential phosphodiester  counterparts by up to 35 degrees . 2'-Deoxy-N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates adopt  RNA-like C3'-endo or N-type nucleoside sugar-ring conformations and hence can be  ,  Context: Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein functions and  interactions. ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, in which ADP-ribosyltransferases use  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to modify target proteins with  ADP-ribose. This modification can occur as mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation. The  latter involves the synthesis of long ADP-ribose chains that have specific  properties due to the nature of the polymer. ADP-Ribosylation is reversed by hydrolases that cleave the glycosidic bonds either between ADP-ribose units or  between the protein proximal ADP-ribose and a given amino acid side chain. Here  we discuss the properties of the different enzymes associated with ADP-ribosylation and the consequences of this PTM on substrates. Furthermore,  the different domains that interpret either mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation and  the implications for cellular processes are described.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,I am uncertain about which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth as it is not mentioned in the provided contexts.," Context: METHODS: MeCP2 expression was silenced using annealed siRNA in HEK293 cells, and  then a cDNA microarray analysis was performed. Functional analysis was carried  out, and transcriptional levels in target genes regulated by MeCP2 were  investigated. TFBS analysis was done within genes selected by the cDNA  microarray analysis, using a weight matrix-based program and the TRANSFAC 6.0  database. RESULTS: Among the differentially expressed genes with a change in expression  greater than two-fold, 189 genes were up-regulated and 91 genes were  down-regulated. Genes related to apoptosis and cell proliferation (JUN, FOSL2,  CYR61, SKIL, ATF3, BMABI, BMPR2, RERE, and FALZ) were highly up-regulated. Genes with anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions (HNRPA0, HIS1, and FOXC1)  were down-regulated. Using TFBS analysis within putative promoters of novel  candidate target genes of MeCP2, disease-related transcription factors were  identified. CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide insights into the new target genes  regulated by MeCP2 under epigenetic control. This information will be valuable  for further studies aimed at clarifying the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome and  ,  Context: Efficient synthesis of many small abundant RNAs is achieved by the proficient  recycling of RNA polymerase (pol) III and stable transcription complexes.  Cellular Alu and related retroposons represent unusual pol III genes that are  normally repressed but are activated by viral infection and other conditions.  The core sequences of these elements contain pol III promoters but must rely on  fortuitous downstream oligo(dT) tracts for terminator function. We show that a  B1-Alu gene differs markedly from a classical pol III gene (tRNAiMet) in  terminator sequence requirements. B1-Alu genes that differ only in terminator  sequence context direct differential RNA 3' end formation. These genes are assembled into stable transcription complexes but differ in their ability to be  recycled in the presence of the La transcription termination factor. La binds to  the nascent RNA 3' UUUOH end motif that is generated by transcriptional termination within the pol III termination signal, oligo(dT).

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to reduce the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer by a factor of three, particularly in children, by protecting against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes."," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,There is no mention of PCDHGC4 or its relation to any condition in the provided context.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,RSK2 regulates stress granule biogenesis by interacting with TIA-1 through its N-terminal kinase domain.," Context: Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast  cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal domain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear  localization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of  cyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: A genome must locate its coding genes on the chromosomes in a meaningful manner  with the help of natural selection, but the mechanism of gene order evolution is  poorly understood. To explore the role of selection in shaping the current order  of coding genes and their cis-regulatory elements, a comparative genomic  approach was applied to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close  relatives. S. cerevisiae have experienced a whole-genome duplication followed by an extensive reorganization process of gene order, during which a number of new  adjacent gene pairs appeared. We found that the proportion of new adjacent gene  pairs in divergent orientation is significantly reduced, suggesting that such new divergent gene pairs may be disfavored most likely because their  coregulation may be deleterious. It is also found that such new divergent gene  pairs have particularly long intergenic regions. These observations suggest that  ,  Context:  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is a minor complication associated with intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane during dental implant placement."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,Relugolix is used to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids (UF) in women.," Context: INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign tumors common in premenopausal  women, with strong impact on the health-care systems. For many years, surgery  represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are  observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical  treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and  in ameliorating patient conditions.  AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"I am uncertain about the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts. The provided context does not mention HuR's functions in fibroblasts, but rather its role in embryonic development,"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ","23223443, 19884656","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is mentioned as being related to muscle cell structure and biological processes, and its pathologies (desminopathies) are discussed. There is no mention of desmin being present in plants.

They are also found in other plant tissues and in some anhydrobotic invertebrates, fungi, protists and prokaryotes. The LEA protein LEAM accumulates  in the matrix space of pea (Pisum sativum) mitochondria during late seed  maturation. LEAM is an intrinsically disordered protein folding into amphipathic alpha-helix upon desiccation. This suggests that it could interact with the  inner mitochondrial membrane, providing structural protection in dry seeds.  Here, we have used Fourier-transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy to  ,  Context: effect of phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation is the disassembly of desmin  filaments, while ubiquitylation of desmin leads to its degradation. The  regulation of the desmin filament network by phosphorylation and  ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological  processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle  atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding  partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus.," Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone has central effects on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue.

Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines).

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction.," Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed.  EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise impact of the basal antithyroid peroxidase level, and the effect of disease  duration on the treatment outcome.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, playing a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development. It defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes.
