What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned.

Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) tissues."," Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling. In this review, 14 multigene assays are evaluated as to  their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval  status, and estimated cost-benefit ratio. Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: nucleotide changes within the mutation cluster at codons 12 and 13, with a  sequence output in the sense direction to facilitate results interpretation.  These assays were used to determine the mutation status in a prospective series  of 1198 sporadic colorectal cancers. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in  13.2% of the colorectal cancers. The frequency of KRAS mutations in our cohort  was 32.4%, with G>A transitions at position 2 of codons 12 and 13 being most  prevalent. Both assays proved highly sensitive and specific when applied to  clinical specimens, and were applicable to both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded archival tissues. These assays would serve as a suitable platform for large-scale mutation detection in cancer specimens where the  facility for pyrosequencing is available.  ,  Context: factors. These specific translocations can be used for exact molecular diagnosis  in these poorly differentiated small round-cell tumors. Moreover, the prognostic  relevance of different translocational variants has been previously suggested.  Furthermore, the sensitive molecular detection of minimal metastatic and  residual disease and its clinical significance can be evaluated. To address  these questions more definitively in the large number of patients registered in  multicenter studies, it is often necessary to access archival paraffin-embedded  tumor tissue if no fresh or frozen tumor material is available for analysis by  RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. Specific problems arise from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue due to the degradation of RNA and insufficient  extraction efficiency. Therefore, primer distance and product size are limited  for successful PCR amplification. This conflicts with the requirement for identification of various possible exon combinations by PCR simultaneously using  one single primer pair with larger distance. PATIENTS: We examined paraffin embedded soft part tumor tissue samples from 47  ,  Context: included. After signing an informed consent, every patient will undergo a pelvic  68Ga -PSMA-11 PSMA PET/MR and receive degarelix at standard dosage and start  assuming apalutamide/placebo (60 mg 4 tablets/day) for 12 weeks. Within thirty  days from the last study medication intake the same imaging will be repeated.  Every patient will undergo PSA and testosterone testing the day of  randomization, before the first drug intake, and after the last dose. Formalin  fixed paraffin embedded tumour samples will be collected and used for  transcriptome analysis, exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry. DISCUSSION: ARNEO will allow us to answer, first, whether the combined treatment can result in an increased proportion of patients with minimal residual disease.  Secondly, It will enable the study of the molecular consequences at the level of  the tumour. Thirdly, what the consequences are of new generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitors on 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/MR. Finally, various clinical,  safety and quality of life data will be collected.

To better understand PDAC metastatic  spread and identify novel therapeutic targets, we analysed the proteome of  primary tumours and matched lymph node (LN) metastases. As frozen specimens of  metastatic lesions are scarce, we examined formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  (FFPE) tissues. This poses technical challenges because of the cross-linkages induced by fixation. Using laser capture microdissection (PALM system), we  isolated malignant epithelia from seven FFPE primary PDAC tumours and matched LN  metastases.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context:  Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS.  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with  characteristics and symptoms that are well defined. Nevertheless, its aetiology  remains unknown. PD is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies inside neurons. α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a soluble protein present in the pre-synaptic  terminal of neurons. Evidence suggests that α-syn has a fundamental role in PD  pathogenesis, given that it is an important component of Lewy bodies localized in the dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the influence of wild type (WT)  and A30P α-syn overexpression on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y toxicity induced by the  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and sleep-disordered breathing. It has also been specifically assessed for its performance in screening for OSA in patients with Major Depressive Episode (M," Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The  NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95%  CI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.  INTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement  score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered  breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal  recording.

We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: 34.8% and 44.4%). The NoSAS score ≥ 7 had higher sensitivity and negative  predictive value(75.0% and 47.1%, 78.1% and 66.5%, 82.7% and 81.9%)than the  NoSAS socre ≥ 8. With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and  lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography followed by detection by MALDI-MS.  This study included 37 patients with OSA and 16 controls. From the 6 metabolites  and 22 lipids initially selected, those with the best association with OSA were  glutamic acid, deoxy sugar and arachidonic acid (metabolites), and  glycerophosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin and lyso-phosphocholines (lipids).  For the questionnaires, the NoSAS score performed best with screening for OSA  (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.724, p = 0.003). The combination of the NoSAS  score with metabolites or lipids resulted in an AUC for detecting OSA of 0.911 and 0.951, respectively. In conclusion, metabolomic and lipidomic strategies  suggested potential early biomarkers in OSA that could also be helpful in  screening for this sleep disorder beyond traditional questionnaires.

When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed.

Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep.

A high-content functional  genomic screen allowed the study of their functional role in muscle  differentiation. One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling  myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from  the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an  in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through backsplicing. Recent methodologies have enabled in-depth  characterization of circRNAs for identification and potential functions.  CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA  ,  Context: are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs,  circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  encode for proteins. The expression of circRNAs is associated with several  pathological states and may potentially serve as novel diagnostic or predictive  biomarkers. CircRNAs are known to regulate the expression of numerous cancer-related miRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis is a known regulatory pattern  of several cancer-associated pathways, with both agonist and antagonist effects  on carcinogenesis. In consideration of their potential clinical relevance, circRNAs are at the center of ongoing research initiatives on cancer prevention  and treatment. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of circRNAs  and the prospects for their potential clinical application in the management of  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA.

EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

The following case  report demonstrates both an expansile lesion of a metacarpal as well as  hemophilic knee arthropathy in an 11 year old.  ,  Context: expected rates in healthy individuals, patients with hemochromatosis had a  significantly higher risk for joint replacement surgery (odds ratio 9.0;  confidence interval, 4.6-17.4). Joint replacement occurred significantly earlier  in life in patients with hemochromatosis; 21.9% of the patients with  hemochromatosis and 1.7% of healthy individuals required joint replacement  before the age of 50 years (P=.0027). Moreover, patients with hemochromatosis  were more likely to require multiple joint replacements (8.5%) than the control  group (expected rate 0.3%; P=.0001). CONCLUSION: Hemochromatosis is a risk factor for joint replacement surgery  because of severe secondary osteoarthritis.  ,  Context:  Rat bite fever is a rare infection typically caused by Streptobacillus  moniliformis.

The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  RESULTS: Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had  improved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance  visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. We  noted a similar outcome after similar treatment applied in the left eye with  UDVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this case, the introduction of successful management of severe cornea abnormalities and scarring with the Athens Protocol may provide an  effective alternative to other existing surgical or medical options.  ,  Context: where organophosphates were used. Pesticide exposure is also associated with  abnormal ocular movements.Progressive toxic ocular effects leading to defective  vision are a serious health concern. Agricultural workers are at high risk of  exposure to pesticides and associated ocular toxicity. Primary prevention is the  appropriate method of protecting eyes from pesticide-related damage. This  includes improved eye safety and care in workplaces, and effective pesticide  regulation for maintenance of public eye health.  ,  Context: paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology,  haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and  recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached  and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert  feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ  system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients  with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care  setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis  may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of  MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.

Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs  in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being  associated with a disease was calculated.

Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses.

The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,MIS-C is an emerging condition identified in pediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or PIMS," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a summary of the diagnosis and management of MIS-C with a focus on management in the acute care  setting. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome which can affect nearly any organ  system. The most common symptoms are fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, though neurologic and dermatologic findings are also well-described. The diagnosis  includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing.

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae.

Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be both pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral, but recent evidence suggests that re-educating TAMs towards an antitumor phenotype using Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) can promote inflammation resolution in"," Context: plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance.

Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor  progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments.

Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic approach could be envisioned in cancer therapy.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant  leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a  protective niche for tumor cells. Their ability to generate an  immune-suppressive environment is crucial to escape the immune system and to  allow the tumor to proliferate and metastasize to distant sites. Conventional  therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often not able to limit  cancer growth due to the presence of pro-tumoral TAMs; these are also  responsible for the failure of novel immunotherapies based on immune-checkpoint  inhibition. Several novel therapeutic strategies have been implemented to deplete TAMs; however, more recent approaches aim to use TAMs themselves as  weapons to fight cancer. Exploiting their functional plasticity, the  reprogramming of TAMs aims to convert immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral macrophages into immunostimulatory and anti-tumor cytotoxic effector cells. This  shift eventually leads to the reconstitution of a reactive immune landscape able  to destroy the tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on  ,  Context: receptor function can contribute to a number of disease states, including  coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and cancer. In this  chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation,  biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In  addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in  oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human  cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for  targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are  described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes"," Context:  To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA treatment significantly  knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not  cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down  Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon  ,  Context:  Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of  transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Gfi1b-null embryos die at  midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice  that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid  specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full  gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to  adulthood.

To  elucidate the mechanism underlying Gfi1b function, potential downstream transcriptional targets were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and  expression profiling approaches. The combination of these approaches revealed  the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple  Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied  by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in  ,  Context:  Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth  ,  Context: Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage  specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation.

METHODS: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers  (2D:4D), and right minus left 2D:4D (Δ(r-l)) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants' hands collected during a recent follow-up of the  Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469  women. Of the 9044 women with available data, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases.

The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Sex steroid exposure during early human development may influence  disease susceptibility. Digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative marker for prenatal  hormone exposure and sensitivity, as well as the action of genes closely related  to carcinogenesis. Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer  predisposition. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared.

RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer  according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships.  ,  Context: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in  excessive androgen exposure in the gestational period and various degrees of  masculinization of the external genitalia in female foetuses.

The most common clinical manifestations include heart failure, arrhythmias and embolic events, and in  children it may be associated with facial dysmorphisms and Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome. Misdiagnosis may occur through lack of awareness of the condition, but with increased vigilance detailed cardiac imaging can reliably differentiate  isolated left ventricular non-compaction from other pathological causes of left  ventricular dysfunction.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by  ,  Context:  DNA repair has an essential role in protecting the genome from damage by  endogenous and environmental agents. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and  differences in repair capacity between individuals have been widely documented. For colorectal cancer, the loss of mismatch repair gene activity is a key  genetic determinant. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR)  and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal  cancer. We have compared the frequency of polymorphisms in the NER genes, XPD,  XPF, XPG, ERCC1; in the BER gene, XRCC1; and in the RR gene, XRCC3; in  ,  Context: from our laboratory using an incremental dose model involving a regenerating  (300 mg/kg, APAP300) and a nonregenerating (600 mg/kg, APAP600) dose of APAP in  mice have revealed several proregenerative pathways that regulate regeneration  after APAP overdose. Here we report that DNA damage and repair mechanisms  regulate initiation of liver regeneration following APAP overdose. Mice treated  with nonregenerating APAP600 dose showed prolonged expression of pH2AX, a marker  of the DNA double-strand break (DSB), compared with APAP300. In regenerating  APAP300 dose-treated mice, H2AX was rapidly dephosphorylated at Tyr142,  indicating timely DNA repair. Expression of several DNA repair proteins was substantially lower with APAP600. Poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) activation,  involved in DNA repair, was significantly higher in the APAP300 group compared  to the APAP600 group. Activation of p53, the major cell cycle checkpoint protein, was significantly higher with APAP600 as demonstrated by substantially  higher expression of its target genes. Taken together, these data show that  massive DNA DSB occurs in high-dose APAP toxicity, and lack of prompt DSB repair  ,  Context: REPAIRtoire is the first comprehensive database resource for systems biology of  DNA damage and repair.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing DDK function. This is achieved through PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1"," Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: 1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that  Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1  regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery.

Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner.

Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal  angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in  pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown.

However, most patients develop acquired drug resistance to EGFR TKIs. HER3 is a unique pseudokinase member of the ERBB family that functions by dimerizing with  other ERBB family members (EGFR and HER2) and is frequently overexpressed in  EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Although EGFR TKI resistance mechanisms do not lead to alterations in HER3, we hypothesized that targeting HER3 might improve efficacy  of EGFR TKI.

It is involved in the  regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and  pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation.  The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric  disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven  classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several  subtypes (4).

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C) are introduced due to directional mutation pressure.," Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection.

Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine  content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.  ,  Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Nothing is mentioned about biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 in the given context.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context:  Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of  severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and  Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients  with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can  reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR). We  studied the INSR gene in five subjects with congenital SIR and in a patient with  type A SIR. Nine biallelic INSR gene mutations (eight novels, including an  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an inherited condition characterised by congenital and  developmental abnormalities and a strong cancer predisposition. In around 3-5%  of cases FA is caused by biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Individuals  heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of inherited breast and  ovarian cancer. We reviewed the mutation spectrum in BRCA2-associated FA, and  the spectrum and frequency of BRCA2 mutations in distinct populations. The  rarity of FA due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations supports a fundamental role of  BRCA2 for prevention of malignant transformation during development. The  spectrum of malignancies seen associated with FA support the concept of a tissue selectivity of BRCA2 mutations for development of FA-associated cancers. This  specificity is illustrated by the distinct FA-associated BRCA2 mutations that  appear to predispose to specific brain or haematological malignancies. For some populations, the number of FA-patients with biallelic BRCA2 disruption is  smaller than that expected from the carrier frequency, and this implies that  some pregnancies with biallelic BRCA2 mutations do not go to term. The apparent  ,  Context: is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and known to function as a tumor  suppressor. To determine whether CYLD mutations play a role in cHL pathogenesis,  we sequenced the gene in cHL cell lines and microdissected HRS cells obtained  from lymph-node biopsies. A biallelic inactivation by mutations was found in the  cHL cell-line KM-H2. However, the other seven cHL cell lines analyzed and HRS  cells of 10 primary cHL cases did not show any mutations. By interphase  cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase  cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating  decreased CYLD copy numbers were observed in a total of 10 of 29 primary cases. Our results suggest that biallelic CYLD mutations are rarely involved in cHL  pathogenesis. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that KM-H2 cells, besides the CYLD  mutations, also carry inactivating mutations in the genes of two other NF-kappaB inhibitors, that is, NFKBIA and TNFAIP3, exemplifying that multiple lesions in  regulators of this signaling pathway can likely cooperatively contribute to the  strong NF-kappaB activity of these cells.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress.

Changes in mTOR activity are often observed in nervous system diseases,  including genetic diseases (e.g., tuberous sclerosis complex, Pten-related  syndromes, neurofibromatosis, and Fragile X syndrome), epilepsy, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and  Huntington's disease).

Here, we show that Esco2 deficiency leads to termination of mouse  development at pre- and post-implantation stages, indicating that Esco2  functions non-redundantly with Esco1. Esco2 is transiently expressed during  S-phase when it localizes to pericentric heterochromatin (PCH). In interphase,  Esco2 depletion leads to a reduction in cohesin acetylation and Sororin  recruitment to chromatin. In early mitosis, Esco2 deficiency causes changes in  the chromosomal localization of cohesin and its protector Sgo1. Our results suggest that Esco2 is needed for cohesin acetylation in PCH and that this  modification is required for the proper distribution of cohesin on mitotic  chromosomes and for centromeric cohesion.  ,  Context: hybrid gene in CML is unknown. Although its mRNA message is in frame, no ABL-BCR  fusion protein has yet been identified in CML patients. The blast crisis of CML  has been variably associated with abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, such as RAS  and MYC, or of tumour suppressor genes, in particular RB, p53 and p16, or with  the generation of chimeric transcription factors, as in the AML1-EVI1 gene  fusion. It is likely, therefore, that multiple and alternative molecular  defects, as opposed to a single universal mechanism, underlie the acute  transformation of the disease.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"The construction of zigzag tubes has been successfully fabricated using a platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system.

The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a paralog of UPC2 in yeast, as it shares high homology with Upc2p, particularly at the carboxy terminus where 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two proteins"," Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition.

To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes.

However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we  investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs  via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal  xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal  cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and  matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were subcultured, purified, and verified by immunofluorescence. Migration, invasion,  and proliferation potentials were compared between the CAFs and NFs. A  co-culture of CAFs with HEp-2 cells and a co-injection of CAFs with HEp-2 cells in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement as a minor complication. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period in one study."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss.

J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The Heyde syndrome describes the coincidence of aortic valve  stenosis and intestinal bleeding. The pathophysiologic link between both  entities has remained unclear so far. In several studies the intestinal  bleedings have been attributed to angiodysplasia. Cessations of the intestinal  bleedings following replacement of the aortic valve have been described by  numerous reports. CASE REPORT: We describe the history of a 70-year-old man with a calcified  aortic valve stenosis. In addition, he suffered from recurrent severe epistaxis  over several years. Replacement of the aortic valve by bioprosthesis resulted in  complete cessation of the nasal bleedings over a follow-up period of 6 years. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that aortic valve stenoses may be  associated with extraintestinal bleedings as well.  ,  Context: markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs,  representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (p < .05).  RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the  study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment,  hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus,  and mobility. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated  with implant loss.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth,  accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small  percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases.  Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body  tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and  bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration. Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying  dental implant failure. PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, AGY cannot be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy. According to the study, AGY was taken by patients with biopsy-proven CD on a GFD, and its effects were observed in terms of celiac symptoms, quality of"," Context: Diuretics belong to the basic group of medicines for the treatment of  hypertension and heart failure. In the case of hypertension treatment, their  main indication is higher age and isolated systolic hypertension. In the case of  heart failure they are used for the treatment of swellings and shortness of  breath. The most frequently prescribed group of diuretics is thiazides and  similar products. In patients with renal insufficiency, loop diuretics are  administered. In the case of hypertension, diuretics are mainly used in the  combination treatment. The most frequently used diuretic in combination is again  hydrochlorothiazide, which is combined with reninangiotensin system blockers. It is mainly the combination of an ACE inhibitor + indapamide that seems to be  modern and promising, and it is, on the basis of large clinical trials,  recommended also for diabetics (ADVANCE) or for secondary prevention following a cerebrovascular accident (PROGRESS) or for the elderly (HYVET). Also a  combination of two diuretics is popular -  mainly hydrochlorothiazide +  amiloride. A combination of a betablocker and diuretic is less suitable.  ,  Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for  ,  Context:  A retrospective study including more than 350,000 women, about 1400 of whom had  developed meningioma, showed that the risk of meningioma was about twice as high  in users of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy as in non-users. Hormone replacement therapy should be discontinued if meningioma is diagnosed.  ,  Context: A retrospective study including more than 350,000 women, about 1400 of whom had  developed meningioma, showed that the risk of meningioma was about twice as high  in users of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy as in non-users. Hormone  replacement therapy should be discontinued if meningioma is diagnosed.  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic. In this paper,  ,  Context: reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and  they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other  oral glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors  declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing  information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage  adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is  also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal  impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of  hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and  will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with  cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve  more attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most  frequently reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while  ","23808745, 28035551, 20738039, 20738039, 17922627, 25488697","No, AGY is an oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody used to neutralize gluten.

Additionally, an"," Context: location in the reference genome. Thus, there is a need for novel  reference-guided bioinformatics algorithms for interpreting analog signals  representing sequences of the bases ({A, C, G, T}), while simultaneously  aligning possible sequence reads to a source reference genome whenever  available.

A linear error model for the raw intensity data  and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a  Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible  genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array  (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance.

The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: In the field of RNA secondary structure prediction, the RNAalifold  algorithm is one of the most popular methods using free energy minimization.  However, general-purpose computers including parallel computers or multi-core  computers exhibit parallel efficiency of no more than 50%. Field Programmable  Gate-Array (FPGA) chips provide a new approach to accelerate RNAalifold by  exploiting fine-grained custom design. RESULTS: RNAalifold shows complicated data dependences, in which the dependence  distance is variable, and the dependence direction is also across two  dimensions.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2C9 is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market.," Context: focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: Attempts to prevent HIV infection through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  include topical application of anti-HIV drugs to the mucosal sites of infection;  however, a potential role for local drug metabolizing enzymes in modulating the  exposure of the mucosal tissues to these drugs has yet to be explored. Here we  present the first report that enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) families of drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed and active in vaginal and colorectal tissue using biopsies collected  from healthy volunteers. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and  maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are  differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Taken  together, these data should help to guide the optimization of small molecules  being developed for HIV PrEP.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed.

However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.  ,  Context: metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good  interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral  factor Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible  and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours.  Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53. This regulation of cell stress response by HuR in progenitor cells promotes cell survival."," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: In dividing cells, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with and stabilizes  labile mRNAs encoding proliferative proteins, events that are linked to the  increased cytoplasmic presence of HuR. Here, assessment of HuR levels in various  vascular pathologies (intimal hyperplasia, atherosclerosis and neointimal  proliferation, sclerosis of arterialized saphenous venous graft, and  fibromuscular dysplasia) revealed a distinct increase in HuR expression and  cytoplasmic abundance within the intima and neointima layers. On the basis of  these observations, we postulated a role for HuR in promoting the proliferation  of vascular smooth muscle cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we investigated the expression, subcellular localization, and proliferative  influence of HuR in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). Treatment of  hVSMCs with platelet-derived growth factor increased HuR levels in the cytoplasm, thereby influencing the expression of metabolic, proliferative, and  structural genes. Importantly, knockdown of HuR expression by using RNA  interference caused a reduction of hVSMC proliferation, both basally and  ,  Context: determine whether these trans-acting factors are likely to play a role in  embryogenesis, we have analysed their expression during mouse development both  at the mRNA and protein levels. We show that AUF1 and HuR are expressed at all  the developmental stages analysed from day 8.5 of embryonic development to  adulthood. Expression levels are dynamic, varying between tissues and  developmental stages. However, a strong positive correlation between AUF1 and  HuR protein levels was observed in all examined tissues. Finally, we compared  AUF1 and HuR expression with accumulation of one common target mRNA, c-myc. The  similar spatio-temporal distribution of these proteins and of c-myc mRNA is in agreement with a potential concerted role in ARE-mediated control of mRNA  stability.  ,  Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ","20232936, 20232936, 21206756, 21206756, 21551148, 21551148",G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy.,"22435808, 21206756, 17038564, 19620965, 30113318, 20232936, 26305225, 21551148"

The  regulation of the desmin filament network by phosphorylation and  ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological  processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle  atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding  partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,"The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome, specifically at Xp22.3."," Context:  INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease.

Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines  and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were  inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on  ,  Context:  Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first"," Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone analogues, such as thyronamines, may have neural routes that affect autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused intravenously with low dose (0.5 mg/kg) thyronamines. Systemic T(1)AM rapidly  increased EGP and plasma glucose, increased plasma glucagon, and corticosterone,  but failed to change plasma insulin. Compared with i.p.-administered T(1)AM, a  ,  Context: The worldwide prevalence of obesity-associated pathologies, including type 2  diabetes, requires thorough investigation of mechanisms and interventions.  Recent studies have highlighted thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives as  potential agents able to counteract such pathologies. In this study, in rats  receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk daily  administration of a naturally occurring iodothyronine, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), on the gastrocnemius muscle metabolic/structural phenotype and insulin  signaling.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.  ,  Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines.

Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values. RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents)  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening. CONCLUSION: HTA and the assessment of screening are well established in the  United Kingdom. Policy is generally based on the assessments done, and practice  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons. We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.  ,  Context: Only a minority of the genes, identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome  sequence data by computer analysis, have been characterized experimentally.

A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions.

Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: (DIC) microscopy, allows for the examination of the temporal progression of  these dynamic events which is otherwise inferred from analysis of fixed  samples(1,2). Moreover, the study of the developmental regulations of cellular  processes necessitates conducting time-lapse experiments on an intact organism  during development. The Caenorhabiditis elegans embryo is light-transparent and  has a rapid, invariant developmental program with a known cell lineage(3), thus  providing an ideal experiment model for studying questions in cell  biology(4,5)and development(6-9). C. elegans is amendable to genetic  manipulation by forward genetics (based on random mutagenesis(10,11)) and reverse genetics to target specific genes (based on RNAi-mediated interference  and targeted mutagenesis(12-15)). In addition, transgenic animals can be readily  created to express fluorescently tagged proteins or reporters(16,17). These traits combine to make it easy to identify the genetic pathways regulating  fundamental cellular and developmental processes in vivo(18-21). In this  protocol we present methods for live imaging of C. elegans embryos using DIC  ,  Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity. It regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters and high Mediator binding density defines super enhancers,"," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.  As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM.
