Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

List features of the Triple A syndrome.,"Yes, the features of Triple A syndrome include dermatological abnormalities, neurologic problems, and primary adrenal insufficiency. The syndrome is variable, with mutations in the ALADIN protein causing impaired function","Context: North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have  identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features  associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed, Context: dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first  Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed  primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later,, Context: triple A syndrome is variable. Our patient manifested neurologic problems during  early childhood, before other features of this condition were apparent. We  highlight the neurologic presentation of this multisystem disorder. In the, Context: the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins  in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function.  Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within, Context: molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in  three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A  syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis.
