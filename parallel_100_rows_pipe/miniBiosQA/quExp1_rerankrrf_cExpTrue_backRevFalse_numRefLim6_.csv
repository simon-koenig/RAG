What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), has been implicated in medulloblastoma, with focal amplifications and homozygous deletions identified in genes targeting"," Context:  We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: was roughly two mutations per Mb, with a median of 45 nonsynonymous mutations  that altered the amino acid sequence (range, 2-381). We found recurrent  mutations in several genes with high transcript levels: TP53 (18%); CTNNB1  (10%); KEAP1 (8%); C16orf62 (8%); MLL4 (7%); and RAC2 (5%). Significantly  affected gene families include the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich  repeat-containing family, calcium channel subunits, and histone  methyltransferases. In particular, the MLL family of methyltransferases for  histone H3 lysine 4 were mutated in 20% of tumors. CONCLUSION: The NFE2L2-KEAP1 and MLL pathways are recurrently mutated in  multiple cohorts of HCC.  ,  Context: Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in human diseases. Unlike genetic  mutations, however, they do not change the underlying DNA sequences. Epigenetic  phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with  many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the  methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput  screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a  miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for  methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it  ,  Context: (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven  histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved  (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and  4 MBs. Group 3 and 4 MBs demonstrate somatic copy number aberrations, and  transcriptional profiles that converge on modifiers of H3K27-methylation (EZH2,  KDM6A, KDM6B), leading to silencing of PRC2-target genes. As PRC2-mediated  aberrant methylation of H3K27 has recently been targeted for therapy in other  diseases, it represents an actionable target for a substantial percentage of  medulloblastoma patients with aggressive forms of the disease.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,No explicit details about the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation are provided.," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  ,  Context: implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of  differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with  significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined  categorization of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) according to the normalization  of cDNA libraries allows searching for putative low-abundant transcripts. The  results are tightly linked to our visualization tools, GeneNest (expression  patterns of genes) and SpliceNest (gene structure and alternative splicing). The  user-friendly interface of T-STAG offers a platform for comprehensive analysis  of tissue and/or tumor-specific expression patterns revealed by the EST data. T-STAG is freely accessible at http://tstag.molgen.mpg.de.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: Proteases play vital roles in many cellular processes and signaling cascades  through specific limited cleavage of their targets. It is important to identify  what proteins are substrates of proteases and where their cleavage sites are so  as to reveal the molecular mechanisms and specificity of signaling. We have  developed a method to achieve this goal using a strategy that chemically tags  the substrate's alpha amine generated by proteolysis, enriches for tagged peptides, and identifies them using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Peptide MS/MS data are searched against a database to  reveal what proteins are cleaved, whereby peptide N-termini demarcate sites of protease cleavage.  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: STAG/SA proteins are specific cohesin complex subunits that maintain sister  chromatid cohesion in mitosis and meiosis. Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1  and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are  found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the  cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are  Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. A recently reported third family member,  STAG3, is germinal cell-specific and is a subunit of the meiotic cohesin  complex. To date, the meiosis-specific cohesin complex has been considered to be  responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. We studied replacement of the mitotic by the meiotic cohesin complex during mouse germinal cell  maturation, and we show that mammalian STAG2 and Rad21 are also involved in  several meiosis stages. Immunofluorescence results suggest that a cohesin complex containing Rad21 and STAG2 cooperates with a STAG3-specific complex to  maintain sister chromatid cohesion during the diplotene stage of meiosis.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"For astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), the hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10 year latency HR ="," Context: BACKGROUND: We analysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in  relation to the use of wireless phones. METHODS: All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour  (n = 1,251) in our case-control studies were included and followed from the date  of diagnosis to the date of death or until May 30, 2012. RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones) gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The  ,  Context: face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer.  RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave  increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following  latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association  between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the  initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new  cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per  100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the  possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile  phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma  and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A  male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and  GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients  originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high  socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive  association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma  was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.  ,  Context: This paper reviews the results of early cellphone studies, where exposure  duration was too short to expect tumorigenesis, as well as two sets of more  recent studies with longer exposure duration: the Interphone studies and the  Swedish studies led by Dr. Lennart Hardell. The recent studies reach very  different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone  studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the  Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the  ,  Context: The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) at WHO evaluation of the  carcinogenic effect of RF-EMF on humans took place during a 24-31 May 2011  meeting at Lyon in France. The Working Group consisted of 30 scientists and  categorised the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phones, and  from other devices that emit similar non-ionising electromagnetic fields  (RF-EMF), as Group 2B, i.e., a 'possible', human carcinogen. The decision on  mobile phones was based mainly on the Hardell group of studies from Sweden and  the IARC Interphone study. We give an overview of current epidemiological  evidence for an increased risk for brain tumours including a meta-analysis of the Hardell group and Interphone results for mobile phone use. Results for  cordless phones are lacking in Interphone. The meta-analysis gave for glioma in  the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.81 in the ≥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell  group) latency group. Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2.29,  95% CI=1.56-3.37.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is applicable for characterizing diverse promoter architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide transcription start sites (TSSs), without relying on known promoter elements. It can be used to identify novel architectures"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter  elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web-server at http://nplb.ncl.res.in Standalone also at https://github.com/computationalBiology/NPLB/ (Mac OSX/Linux). CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Currently DNA profiling methods only compare a suspect's DNA with DNA left at  the crime scene. When there is no suspect, it would be useful for the police to  be able to predict what the person of interest looks like by analysing the DNA  left behind in a crime scene. Determination of the age of the suspect is an  important factor in creating an identikit. Human somatic cells gradually lose  telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a  correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual  from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged  between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR. Telomere length decreased with age (r=-0.185, P<0.05) and the age of an  individual could be roughly determined by the following formula: (age=relative  telomere length -1.5/-0.005). The regression (R(2)) value between telomere length and age was approximately 0.04, which is too low to be use for forensics.  The causes for the presence of large variation in telomere lengths in the  population were further investigated. The age prediction accuracies were low  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.  ,  Context: (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: Novel bi-directional duplex promoters (BDDP) were constructed by placing two  identical core promoters divergently on both upstream and downstream sides of  their duplicated enhancer elements. Estimates of promoter function were obtained  by creating versions of CaMV 35S and CsVMV BDDPs that contained reporter marker  genes encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and enhanced green fluorescent protein  (EGFP) interchangeably linked either to the upstream or downstream core  promoters. GUS was used for quantitative analysis of promoter function, whereas,  EGFP allowed visual qualitative evaluation. In addition, the GUS and EGFP genes  placed in downstream positions were modified by translational fusion with neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) to allow simultaneous monitoring of promoter  activity and selection of stable transformants. These versions of BDDP were  compared with each other and with equivalent unidirectional constructs by evaluating their expression in grape and tobacco. For 35S promoter constructs  tested in grape somatic embryos (SE), BDDP exhibited transient GUS expression  206- and 300-fold greater in downstream and upstream configurations,  ,  Context: Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing by analysis of cell-free DNA in the  maternal circulation is a rapidly evolving field. Current clinical applications  include fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D determination, the diagnosis of  some single gene disorders, and a highly accurate screening test for  aneuploidies. In the future it is likely to be used for the diagnosis of an  increasing range of monogenic disorders, and may even be used to profile entire fetal genomes. The introduction of these tests into clinical practice brings  clear benefits but also poses several ethical, social and service delivery  challenges. Here, we discuss the current clinical applications, discuss some of the technical and ethical challenges, and look to what the future might bring as  technology continues to evolve.

Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By  capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using pre-determined performance criteria, which is a critical component of molecular  diagnostic test validation. RESULTS: All analytical measurements met pre-specified performance criteria.

Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of  genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions. Preliminary assessment  of the investigational Oncomine Dx Target Test suggests it could facilitate  ,  Context: nucleotide changes within the mutation cluster at codons 12 and 13, with a  sequence output in the sense direction to facilitate results interpretation.  These assays were used to determine the mutation status in a prospective series  of 1198 sporadic colorectal cancers. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in  13.2% of the colorectal cancers. The frequency of KRAS mutations in our cohort  was 32.4%, with G>A transitions at position 2 of codons 12 and 13 being most  prevalent. Both assays proved highly sensitive and specific when applied to  clinical specimens, and were applicable to both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded archival tissues. These assays would serve as a suitable platform for large-scale mutation detection in cancer specimens where the  facility for pyrosequencing is available.  ,  Context: the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease (LBD)," Context:  Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  ,  Context: We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we  added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological  characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the most recent concept of LBD from the historical viewpoint.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ,  Context: It is well known that autonomic failure is severer in patients with dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).  According to the Braak's hypothesis, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory  bulb or peripheral autonomic nervous system. Lewy bodies in the peripheral  autonomic nervous system ascend to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerve, while  those in the olfactory bulb expand to the limbic system. Lewy bodies later  attain the substantia nigra. However, it seems that Braak staging can not  explain difference in severity of autonomic failure between DLB and PD. As a  possibility, in DLB patients with significant autonomic failure, Lewy bodies may have been localized to the peripheral autonomic nervous system in a long time  before onset of dementia or parkinsonism, and propagation of Lewy bodies into  the central nervous system may be initiated by apparition of certain promotion factor, such as ageing and amyloid-β.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).," Context: compare its performance with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), STOP-Bang, and  Berlin questionnaires for high-risk SDB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Patients who had a  full-night PSG examination between 01.03.2017 and 01.01.2018 at the sleep center  of our hospital were included in the study. Demographic characteristics,  anthropometrics measurements, ESS, STOP-Bang, and Berlin scores were collected  from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB. RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4% for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI  ,  Context: scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of ≥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening.  A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.  ,  Context: 34.8% and 44.4%). The NoSAS score ≥ 7 had higher sensitivity and negative  predictive value(75.0% and 47.1%, 78.1% and 66.5%, 82.7% and 81.9%)than the  NoSAS socre ≥ 8. With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).  FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,Pufferfish (Takifugu niphobles)," Context: Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as  gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context: Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is  the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS) analysis revealed that the pufferfish larvae contain a small quantity of TTX,  which is not enough to be lethal to the predators. Immunohistochemical analysis  with anti-TTX monoclonal antibody revealed that the TTX is primarily localized  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context: dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to  the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation  with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field  stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter  of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field  stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence  of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  ,  Context: Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins,  tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context: Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such  as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply  of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly  produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps  might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species.  ,  Context: Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called  selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use combinations of statistics, maximum likelihood, machine learning etc. In this  survey, we present and discuss summary statistics and software tools, and  classify them based on the selective sweep signature they detect, i.e.,  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. FINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.

List markers for autophagy.,"LC3-II, Atg5, and LC3-I are markers for autophagy."," Context: (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins  contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  monitoring autophagy, including the use of GFP-LC3 and GFP-Atg5, are discussed.  ,  Context: point to fully integrated, multitiered regulatory and effector connections  between autophagy and nearly all facets of innate and adaptive immunity.  Autophagy in the immune system as a whole confers measured immune responses; on  the flip side, suppression of autophagy can lead to inflammation and tissue  damage, as evidenced by Crohn's disease predisposition polymorphisms in  autophagy basal apparatus (Atg16L) and regulatory (IRGM) genes. Polymorphisms in  the IRGM gene in human populations have also been linked to predisposition to  tuberculosis. There are several areas of most recent growth: first, links  between autophagy regulators and infectious disease predisposition in human populations; second, demonstration of a role for autophagy in infection control  in vivo in animal models; third, the definition of specific antiautophagic  defenses in highly evolved pathogens; and fourth, recognition of connections between the ubiquitin system and autophagy of bacteria (and interestingly  mitochondria, which are incidentally organelles of bacterial evolutionary  origin) via a growing list of modifier and adapter proteins including  ,  Context: Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell  death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin  sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays qRT-PCR, and also in paraffin-embedded tissue section from human biopsy material  by using immunohistochemistry.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: The role of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in response to DNA  damage has previously been studied, but its underlying mechanisms specific to  ionizing radiation (IR) have remained to be elucidated. In this study, function  of ATM on radiation-induced cell death in lung cancer H1299 cells was analysed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human lung cancer cells, H1299, were used, and cell  models with ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) were established by genetic engineering.  Radiosensitivity was analysed using colony formation assays. Western blotting  and co-immunoprecipitation were implemented to detect protein expression and  interaction. MDC staining and GFP-LC3 relocalization were used to detect  autophagy. RESULTS: Autophagy as well as phosphorylation of ATM was activated by ionizing  radiation. Both the inhibitor of ATM, KU55933 and ATM silencing reduced  phosphorylation of ATM and MAPKAPK2 expression. Both ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) cells displayed hypersensitivity. IR increased autophagy level by more than 129%  in DMSO-treated cells, while only by 47% and 27% in KU55933-treated and ATM(-/-)  cells respectively. MAPK14 knock-down alone gave rise to the basal autophagy  ,  Context: AIMS: On the basis of our previous reports that cardioprotection induced by  ischaemic preconditioning induces autophagy and that resveratrol, a polyphenolic  antioxidant present in grapes and red wine induces preconditioning-like effects,  we sought to determine if resveratrol could induce autophagy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Resveratrol at lower doses (0.1 and 1 microM in H9c2  cardiac myoblast cells and 2.5 mg/kg/day in rats) induced cardiac autophagy  shown by enhanced formation of autophagosomes and its component LC3-II after  hypoxia-reoxygenation or ischaemia-reperfusion. The autophagy was attenuated  with the higher dose of resveratrol. The induction of autophagy was correlated with enhanced cell survival and decreased apoptosis. Treatment with rapamycin  (100 nM), a known inducer of autophagy, did not further increase autophagy  compared with resveratrol alone. Autophagic inhibitors, wortmannin (2 microM) and 3-methyladenine (10 mM), significantly attenuated the resveratrol-induced  autophagy and induced cell death.

Which package is available for analysing genomic interactions in R/Bioconductor?,BioGRID," Context: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified many  sequence variants that are significantly associated with common diseases and  traits. Tens of thousands of such trait-associated SNPs have already been  cataloged, which we believe form a great resource for genomic research.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some circRNAs can generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome."," Context: translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs,  and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CircPro is available at  http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro.  ,  Context: myogenesis and altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A high-content functional  genomic screen allowed the study of their functional role in muscle  differentiation. One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling  myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from  the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an  in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a long non‑coding RNA molecule with a closed loop  structure lacking a 5'cap and 3'tail. circRNA is stable, difficult to cleave and  resistant to RNA exonuclease or RNase R degradation. circRNA molecules have several clinical applications, especially in tumors. For instance, circRNA may  be used for non‑invasive diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Exosomes play a  crucial role in the development of tumors. Exosomal circRNA in particular has led to increased research interest into tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Additionally, exosomal circRNA plays a role in cell‑cell communication. Exosomal  circRNA facilitates tumor metastasis by altering the tumor microenvironment and  ,  Context: the mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7,  particularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of  endogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA,  sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that  miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.  This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a  naturally expressed circRNA.  ,  Context: and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue  compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice  machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated  miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a  reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more  recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate  aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments. In  addition, though originally thought to be non-coding, there is now increasing  evidence to suggest that select circRNAs can be translated into functional proteins. Although much remains to be elucidated about circRNA biology and  mechanisms of gene regulation, these ncRNAs are quickly emerging as potential  disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.

"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?",No," Context:  HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral  medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used  PrEP medication (Truvada® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV NAT.

WHO released new guidelines in  2015 recommending PrEP for all populations at substantial risk of HIV infection.  To prepare these guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of values and  preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP, women, heterosexual  men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people and people who inject drugs, and among healthcare  providers who may prescribe PrEP. A comprehensive search strategy reviewed three  electronic databases of articles and HIV-related conference abstracts (January 1990-April 2015). Data abstraction used standardised forms to categorise by  population groups and relevant themes. Of 3068 citations screened, 76  peer-reviewed articles and 28 conference abstracts were included.

METHODS: A detailed mathematical model was used to simulate the epidemiological  impact of ART alone, PrEP alone, and combined ART + PrEP in South Africa. RESULTS: ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count <200 cells/µL (80% coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but  increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75%  effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance  ,  Context:  Despite significant efforts, the rate of new HIV infections worldwide remains  unacceptably high, highlighting the need for new HIV prevention strategies. HIV  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new approach that involves the ongoing use of antiretroviral medications by HIV-negative individuals to reduce the risk of  HIV infection. The use of daily tenofovir/emtricitabine as oral PrEP was found  to be effective in multiple placebo-controlled clinical trials and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the World Health  Organization have both released guidelines recommending the offer of oral PrEP  ,  Context:  Modern antiretroviral therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in preexposure  prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment of HIV infection.

Controls were  randomly selected from individuals who visited the same hospital or a  community-based health examination program during the same time period. A 5 ml  venous blood sample was obtained from each participant and epidemiological  information was collected on a standard questionnaire. Illumina Infinium(®)  BeadChip was used for genotyping of 35 DNA damage-related single nucleotide  variations (SNVs), which were identified in our previous study. Multivariate and  binary logistic regressions were used to calculate the OR and 95%CI for lung  cancer risk. HaploReg V4.1 and Regulome DB were used to understand functional annotation on important SNV. RESULTS: The distributions of age (61.06±10.15) vs. (61.32±11.07) years;  t=-0.72, P=0.473) and sex (χ(2)=1.81, P=0.179) were similar between cases and controls.

This  has increased the urgency of understanding the regulatory genome as a key  component for translating genetic results into mechanistic insights and  ultimately therapeutics. To address this challenge, we developed HaploReg  (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) to aid the functional dissection of  genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal  variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and  the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations.

As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource  to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment. Similarly  to the Human Genome Project (HGP), the HPP chose a chromosome-centric approach,  assigning different chromosomes to different countries. Here we introduce a scoring method for chromosome ranking based on several characteristics,  including relevance to health problems, existing published knowledge, and  current transcriptome and proteome coverage. The score of each chromosome was computed as a weighted combination of indexes reflecting the aforementioned  characteristics. The approach is tailored to the chromosome-centric HPP (C-HPP),  and is advantageous in that it takes into account currently available  ,  Context: The International Haplotype Map Project (HapMap) has provided an essential  database for studies of human population genetics and genome-wide association.  Phases I and II of the HapMap project generated genotype data across ∼3 million  SNP loci in 270 individuals representing four populations. Phase III provides  dense genotype data on ∼1.5 million SNPs, generated by Illumina and Affymetrix  platforms in a larger set of individuals. Release 3 of phase III of the HapMap contains 1397 individuals from 11 populations, including 250 of the original 270  phase I and phase II individuals and 1147 additional individuals. Although some  known relationships among the phase III individuals have been described in the data release, the genotype data that are currently available provide an  opportunity to empirically ascertain previously unknown relationships.

Aberrant rereplication correlates  with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation  (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse  embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or  cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an  artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC)  in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20  methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding  properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in  higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: examine tools for viewing and analysing haplotype and LD data, enabling a number  of tasks; including identification of optimal sets of haplotype tagging single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); drawing links between associated SNPs and  putative causal alleles; or simply viewing LD and haplotypes across a gene or  region of interest. The data generated by the HapMap also has other important  applications, informing, for example, on the demographic history and evidence of  selection in human populations and on previously undetected regulatory  relationships and gene networks.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context: Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging  disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced  ""progerin"" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear  architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression  changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown  that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS),  characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of  stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA  sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also found that calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, rescues RS and  represses the cGAS/STING/IFN cascade. Here, the mechanisms underlying RS in  progerin-expressing cells and the rescue by calcitriol are explored. It is found that progerin elicits a marked downregulation of RAD51, concomitant with  increased levels of phosphorylated-RPA, a marker of RS. Interestingly,  calcitriol prevents RS and activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN response in part  ,  Context: damage, accumulates at gene-rich regions of the genome in Top1-deficient cells.  This is best illustrated at histone genes, which are highly expressed during S  phase and display discrete γ-H2AX peaks on ChIP-chip profiles. Here, we show  that these γ-H2AX domains are different from those induced by camptothecin, a  Top1 inhibitor inducing double-strand DNA breaks throughout the genome. These  data support the view that R-loops promote genomic instability at specific sites  by blocking fork progression and inducing chromosome breaks. Whether this type  of transcription-dependent fork arrest contributes to the replication stress  observed in precancerous lesions is an important question that deserves further  attention.  ,  Context: SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of  Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent  annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage.  Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD),  an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and  growth dysfunctions. In this review, we summarize the main roles of SMARCAL1 in  DNA repair, telomere maintenance and replication fork stability in response to  DNA replication stress.  ,  Context:  Cellular DNA is under constant challenge by exogenous and endogenous genotoxic  stress, which results in both transient and accumulated DNA damage and genomic  instability. All cells are equipped with DNA damage response pathways that trigger DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and, if need be, apoptosis, to eliminate  DNA damage or damaged cells. The consequences of these processes for stem cells  can be profound: diminution in stem cell pools, or, because of altered gene expression, an increased chance for stem cell differentiation or malignant  transformation.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, according to the context, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, suggesting that transcriptional activation has a ripple effect."," Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of  cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied  ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of  cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals ""blob"" structures within the supragranular  layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have  not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the  activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and  c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period  of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers,  where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in  layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the ""border strips"" of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (>5 h),  the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured,  changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy  ,  Context: Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation. As transcription of IE genes does not require  prior viral protein synthesis, this class of genes is experimentally defined by  their transcription following primary infection or reactivation in the presence  of inhibitors of protein synthesis. This chapter describes an approach to  identify IE genes in a novel herpesvirus genome. Transcription of IE genes is selectively induced with sodium butyrate in the presence of the protein  synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The transcripts of the induced genes are  identified by using a cDNA subtraction-based method of gene expression  screening.  ,  Context: expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics  translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental  disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created  mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality.  Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered  dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature  transcripts and govern their fate. However, natural IGs manage to maintain  satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the  problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.  ,  Context: affect the positive regulatory function of DSIF. Knockdown of the gene encoding  the large subunit of DSIF, human Spt5 (hSpt5), in HeLa cells reduced  Gal4-VP16-mediated activation of a reporter gene, but had no effect on  expression in the absence of activator. Together, these results provide evidence  that higher-level transcription has a stronger requirement for DSIF, and that  DSIF contributes to efficient transcriptional activation by preventing RNAPII  pausing during transcription elongation.  ,  Context: system, variable effects on the genitourinary tract, and, in general, positive  effects on serum lipid levels.

Disadvantages of SERMs include exacerbation of  menopausal symptoms and, as with estrogen, an increased incidence of venous  thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. SERMs act by modifying the configuration of the  estrogen receptor. Effects at the gene transcription level seem to be tissue specific, a factor that likely accounts for the variability of clinical action  seen.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Keratoconus.," Context: the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were:  42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform. RESULTS: Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had  improved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance  visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription."," Context: Recent clinical trials using rapalogues in tuberous sclerosis complex show  regression in volume of typically vascularised tumours including angiomyolipomas  and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. By blocking mechanistic/mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas  ,  Context: diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs,  PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: modification in mice impaired intestinal cell proliferation and induced cell  apoptosis, leading to high mortality in dextran sodium sulfate- and  2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis models. Through bone marrow  transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN  promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated  mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context:  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is one of a family of  cytoplasmic proteins that participate in normal cellular responses to cytokines  and growth factors as transcription factors. Stat3 modulates various physiological functions including cell survival, cell-cycle regulation, and  angiogenesis through regulation of gene expression, and its constitutive  activation is associated with a number of human epithelial cancers.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence."," Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to  decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by  deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and resulting in accumulation of  homogentisic acid in collagenous structures. This causes the classic clinical  triad: (1) homogentisic aciduria (urine blackens on standing when oxidized or  alkalinized); (2) eumelanin-like pigmentation of skin, sclera, cartilages, etc  and (3) degenerative ochronic arthropathies usually in the fourth decade of life. Other important but more rare consequences of alkaptonuric ochronosis are  cardiovascular and urinary tract involvement. We present a case of ochronosis  with multiple visceral involvement: skin (fingers, ear sclera), severe spondylarthropaty with extensive calcifications of intervertebral discs and  reduced mobility, osteoarthritis of both knees, right hip ostonecrosis,  cardiovascular involvement (severe stenosis and insufficiency of aortic valve  ,  Context: The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology  characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial  paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The  orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen,  nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is  indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to  one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence  assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete  form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis  granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably  present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the  Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a  ,  Context:  Fifty patients suffering from the ""exploding head syndrome"" are described.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA (cleavage and polyadenylation), with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages."," Context: The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by  sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA  reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the  ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are  ,  Context: SET domain-containing proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved family of  epigenetic regulators, which are responsible for most histone lysine  methylation. Since some of these genes have been revealed to be essential for  embryonic development, we propose that the zebrafish, a vertebrate model  organism possessing many advantages for developmental studies, can be utilized  to study the biological functions of these genes and the related epigenetic mechanisms during early development. To this end, we have performed a  genome-wide survey of zebrafish SET domain genes. 58 genes total have been  identified. Although gene duplication events give rise to several lineage-specific paralogs, clear reciprocal orthologous relationship reveals  high conservation between zebrafish and human SET domain genes. These data were  further subject to an evolutionary analysis ranging from yeast to human, leading  ,  Context: 3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin  expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA  was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish coincides with that reported for MyoD and myogenin.  ,  Context: Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are  characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities,  limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar  suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the  underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic  failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the  underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled  as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering  events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells,  which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We  highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms  underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the  predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental  ,  Context: Hox clusters because of an additional ""teleost-specific"" genome duplication  event. By sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole  genome, here we provide evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese  lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This suggests that the lamprey lineage has  experienced an additional genome duplication after 1R and 2R. The relative age  of lamprey and human paralogs supports this hypothesis. Compared with  gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are unusually large. Several  conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the Hox clusters of  lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in individual  lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in  elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the  first two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the  lamprey and gnathostome lineages.  ,  Context: proteins that may form high-molecular-weight (HMW) aggregates in the matrix of  fish otoliths that have aragonite and vaterite as their crystal polymorphs. By  screening a cDNA library of the trout inner ear using an antiserum raised  against whole otolith matrix, a novel protein, named otolith matrix  macromolecule-64 (OMM-64), was identified. The protein was found to have a  molecular mass of 64 kDa, and to contain two tandem repeats and a Glu-rich  region. The structure of the protein and that of its DNA are similar to those of  starmaker, a protein involved in the polymorphism control in the zebrafish  otoliths [Söllner C, Burghammer M, Busch-Nentwich E, Berger J, Schwarz H, Riekel C & Nicolson T (2003) Science302, 282-286]. (45)Ca overlay analysis revealed  that the Glu-rich region has calcium-binding activity.

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,PMP22," Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy signified by a distal symmetric  polyneuropathy.

However, she presented  with a more severe phenotype than her sibling or ancestors and was found to have a PMP22 triplication instead of the duplication. This was caused by de novo  mutation on her affected mother's duplication chromosome. Her lower limb  magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe diffused atrophy and fatty  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  ,  Context: Duplication of the gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa (PMP22)  underlies the most common inherited neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A),  a disease without a known cure. Although demyelination represents a  characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the  degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and  impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of  life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological  abnormalities are already present in childhood. Here, we show in  Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early postnatal development, caused by imbalanced  activity of the PI3K-Akt and the Mek-Erk signaling pathways. We demonstrate that  enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling by axonally overexpressed neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type I drives diseased Schwann cells toward differentiation and preserves peripheral  nerve axons.

On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months).

Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed.

It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Clinical development of  avapritinib is also underway for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis and late-stage solid tumours in several countries.  ,  Context: structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced  surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the  nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete  tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the  radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the  structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently  healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new  expectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab,  imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an  increase in overall survival. The main objective is to improve median overall  survival, which is currently between 9 and 12 months, with a good quality of life, measured by the ability to carry out daily life activities.  ,  Context: The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) against epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) are widely used in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  However, EGFR T790M mutation leads to resistance to most clinically available  EGFR TKIs. Third-generation EGFR TKIs against the T790M mutation have been in  active clinical development. These agents include osimertinib, rociletinib,  HM61713, ASP8273, EGF816, and PF-06747775. Osimertinib and rociletinib have shown clinical efficacy in phase I/II trials in patients who had acquired  resistance to first- or second-generation TKIs. Osimertinib (AZD9291, TAGRISSO)  was recently approved by FDA for metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC. HM61713, ASP8237, EGF816, and PF-06747775 are still in early clinical  development.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"According to the provided context, circRNAs serve as microRNA sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors, and have special functionalities due to their stability and conservation in cytoplasm. They also regulate gene expression in mammals."," Context: Circular RNA (or circRNA) is a type of single-stranded covalently closed  circular RNA molecule and play important roles in diverse biological pathways. A  comprehensive functionally annotated circRNA database will help to understand  the circRNAs and their functions. CircFunBase is such a web-accessible database  that aims to provide a high-quality functional circRNA resource including  experimentally validated and computationally predicted functions. CircFunBase provides visualized circRNA-miRNA interaction networks. In addition, a genome  browser is provided to visualize the genome context of circRNA. In this chapter,  we illustrate examples of searching for circRNA and getting detailed information of circRNA. Moreover, other circRNA related databases are outlined.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly stable forms of non-coding RNAs with diverse  biological functions. They are implicated in modulation of gene expression thus  affecting various cellular and disease processes. Based on existing bioinformatics approaches, we developed a comprehensive workflow called Circ-Seq  to identify and report expressed circRNAs. Circ-Seq also provides informative  genomic annotation along circRNA fused junctions thus allowing prioritization of circRNA candidates. We applied Circ-Seq first to RNA-sequence data from breast  cancer cell lines and validated one of the large circRNAs identified. Circ-Seq  was then applied to a larger cohort of breast cancer samples (n = 885) provided  ,  Context:  Circular RNA (circRNA) is a highly stable, single-stranded, closed-loop RNA that  works as RNA or as a protein decoy to regulate gene expression. In humans,  thousands of circRNA transcriptional products precisely express in specific developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Due to their stability and  specificity, circRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  To provide an integrated and standardized circRNA expression profile for human cancers, we performed extensive data curation across 11 technical platforms,  collecting 48 expression profile data sets for 18 cancer types and amassing  860 751 expression records.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,X-ray free electron laser is used at the Linac Coherent Light Source.," Context: PS II. Various X-ray studies have been carried out at cryogenic temperatures to  understand the intermediate steps involved in the water oxidation mechanism.  However, the necessity for collecting data at room temperature, especially for  studying the transient steps during the O-O bond formation, requires the  development of new methodologies. In this paper we report room temperature X-ray  diffraction data of PS II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort (< 50 fs)  9 keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac  Coherent Light Source. The results presented here demonstrate that the ""probe  before destroy"" approach using an X-ray free electron laser works even for the highly-sensitive Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster in PS II at room temperature. We show that  these data are comparable to those obtained in synchrotron radiation studies as  seen by the similarities in the overall structure of the helices, the protein subunits and the location of the various cofactors. This work is, therefore, an  important step toward future studies for resolving the structure of the  Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster without any damage at room temperature, and of the reaction  ,  Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.  ,  Context: of these complementary experimental approaches when seeking to understand  protein conformational dynamics. These methods are illustrated using a limited  set of examples including myoglobin and haemoglobin in complex with carbon  monoxide, the simple light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, and the  superoxide scavenger superoxide reductase. In conclusion, likely future  developments of these methods at synchrotron X-ray sources and the potential  impact of emerging X-ray free-electron laser facilities are speculated upon.  ,  Context: or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a  nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects  with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial  resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science  samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the  techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray  free-electron laser sources.  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context: A multi-crystal wavelength dispersive hard x-ray spectrometer with high-energy  resolution and large solid angle collection is described. The instrument is  specifically designed for time-resolved applications of x-ray emission  spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) at X-ray Free Electron  Lasers (XFEL) and synchrotron radiation facilities. It also simplifies resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the whole 2d RIXS plane. The  spectrometer is based on the Von Hamos geometry. This dispersive setup enables  an XES or XRS spectrum to be measured in a single-shot mode, overcoming the  scanning needs of the Rowland circle spectrometers. In conjunction with the XFEL temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics  of time-dependent systems.

Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three  cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be  impaired and iron is pooled within macrophages.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare incidental finding seen on endoscopy and has  the characteristic appearance of flat, black-speckled pigmented mucosa. We  present the case of an 83-year-old woman who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have pseudomelanosis duodeni. The finding has no  diagnostic or prognostic significance. Therapeutic chelation or endoscopic  follow-up is not recommended.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare, benign condition of unknown etiology. It is  characterized by collection of pigment-laden macrophages in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment, originally interpreted as melanin, pseudomelanin, lipomelanin or hemosiderin, has now been demonstrated to be mostly ferrous  sulfide. There is a strong association with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and the use of medications such as ferrous sulfate, hydralazine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide. We  reported a case of a 48 years old female who only had dyspeptic symptoms and no  history of hypertension or drug history. Laboratory tests showed normal serum  ,  Context: Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare entity characterised by dark pigmented  intracellular granules seen within macrophages that lie within the lamina  propria of the duodenal villi. There is no known treatment, and the clinical  significance and long-term sequelae of this entity are unclear. We present a  case of pseudomelanosis duodeni in a 54-year-old woman who presented with a  1-month history of nausea, vomiting and non-bloody diarrhoea. The medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease  status postkidney transplant, hypertension, anaemia of chronic disease and  hypothyroidism. A gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed pigmented dark lesions in the duodenal mucosa. Biopsies from the second part of the duodenum and duodenal  bulb showed pigmented macrophages in the lamina propria. The findings were  consistent with duodenal melanosis.

However, pseudomelanosis duodeni may be identified histologically even  before it becomes endoscopically evident; iron stainability within the mucosa is  uneven and unpredictable, and multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron  intake may be associated. We reviewed 17 adult patients with histologically detected pseudomelanosis duodeni, their endoscopic appearances, iron  stainability, and clinical findings including oral iron and drug intake. Only  6/17 (35 %) had endoscopically apparent dark spots. Perl's iron stain was entirely positive in 18 %, partially positive in 64 %, and negative in 18 % of  cases.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I don't know the answer.," Context: Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through  receptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate  variant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the  normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  ,  Context: dose-dependently decreased in the 25 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) and 50 mg/kg BW (p <  0.005) amiodarone-treated mice compared with control. Serum T3 levels were  significantly decreased by 25% (4.2 +/- 0.7 pM) in the 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone  group in comparison to control (5.6 +/- 1.4 pM; p < 0.05). The serum T4 levels  were 1.3 times higher in 50 mg/kg BW amiodarone-treated mice (13.2 +/-1.6 pM)  compared with the control (10.3 +/- 1.3 pM; p < 0.005). Determination of  TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2 mRNA in the heart were performed by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone  dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in  comparison to the control. There were, however, no differences in the TRalpha2 and TRbeta2 mRNA levels in the mice heart treated with different doses of  amiodarone in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, this study shows  that amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ,  Context: TRalpha1 and TRbeta, which act as T3-dependent transcription factors, was  investigated in receptor-deficient mice. Liver and kidney D1 mRNA and activity  levels were reduced in TRbeta(-/-) but not TRalpha1(-/-) mice. Liver D1 remained  weakly T3 inducible in TRbeta(-/-) mice whereas induction was abolished in  double mutant TRalpha1(-/-)TRbeta(-/-) mice. This indicates that TRbeta is  primarily responsible for regulating D1 expression whereas TRalpha1 has only a  minor role. In kidney, despite the expression of both TRalpha1 and TRbeta,  regulation relied solely on TRbeta, thus revealing a marked tissue restriction  in TR isotype utilization. Although TRbeta and TRalpha1 mediate similar functions in vitro, these results demonstrate differential roles in regulating  D1 expression in vivo and suggest that tissue-specific factors and structural  distinctions between TR isotypes contribute to functional specificity. Remarkably, there was an obligatory requirement for a TR, whether TRbeta or  TRalpha1, for any detectable D1 expression in liver. This suggests a novel  paradigm of gene regulation in which the TR sets both basal expression and the  ,  Context: The present study investigated whether changes in thyroid hormone (TH)  signalling can occur after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with possible  physiological consequences on myocardial performance. TH may regulate several  genes encoding important structural and regulatory proteins particularly through  the TR alpha 1 receptor which is predominant in the myocardium. AMI was induced  in rats by ligating the left coronary artery while sham-operated animals served as controls. This resulted in impaired cardiac function in AMI animals after 2  and 13 weeks accompanied by a shift in myosin isoforms expression towards a  fetal phenotype in the non-infarcted area. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident in AMI hearts after 13 weeks but not at 2 weeks. This response was associated with  a differential pattern of TH changes at 2 and 13 weeks; T(3) and T(4) levels in  plasma were not changed at 2 weeks but T(3) was significantly lower and T(4)  ","11731613, 10445678, 23926648, 18622044, 11222747, 17389455","ARB1, ARB2, TAK1, p38, TRalpha1","18031713, 15831522, 11731613"

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading worldwide since  December 2019. Hundreds of cases of children and adolescents with Kawasaki  disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of  ,  Context: We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). This adolescent male  presented prior to any known association between COVID-19 and immune mediated  inflammatory syndrome in children. He presented in stable condition and without  significant multisystem involvement. During hospitalization, he developed severe  left ventricular dysfunction and mixed hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic  shock. Clinical features overlapped with Kawasaki disease, acute rheumatic  fever, and toxic shock syndrome. After centers in Europe began reporting a  multisystem inflammatory condition in children with COVID-19, the patient's clinical course and laboratory findings were revisited. He underwent newly  available antibody testing and was diagnosed as one of the first known cases of  MIS-C in the United States.  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Here we summarize current knowledge about multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a presumed postinfectious  inflammatory condition that has emerged as an important COVID-19-associated complication, to help clinicians identify and manage cases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentation of MIS-C is dominated by significant  inflammation. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension are common features. Kawasaki disease-like findings are common, but  epidemiologic data and recent mechanistic studies suggest that distinct  inflammatory pathways mediate Kawasaki disease and MIS-C. A broad diagnostic  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a dangerous  pediatric complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a summary of the diagnosis and management of MIS-C with a focus on management in the acute care  setting. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome which can affect nearly any organ  system. The most common symptoms are fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, though neurologic and dermatologic findings are also well-described. The diagnosis  includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing. Patients with MIS-C  will often have elevated inflammatory markers and may have an abnormal  ","33679227, 33445833, 32837148, 33278107, 34880708, 34116467","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection. A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae.

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,Yes," Context:  INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder involving neurogenic  inflammation and transmission of trigeminovascular nociceptive pathways mediated  by Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Several small molecules antagonizing the CGRP receptor have been developed as migraine-specific acute medications.  The CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant, also known as MK-1602, has been  recently evaluated in phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This  trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic  safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant. Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety  population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The  ,  Context: Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, New Jersey) has recently published an integrated  strategy for implementation of dried blood spots (DBS) in late-stage trials for  population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. We applied this strategy for another  late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was  implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a  phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using  graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was  ,  Context: Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy™) is an orally administered, small molecule,  highly-selective, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that was  developed by Allergan under license to Merck & Co. as an acute treatment for  migraine. In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ubrogepant leading to its first global approval for the acute treatment of migraine (± aura) in adults.  ,  Context: antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed  tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg  for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.  Ubrogepant was well-tolerated in both trials, with a low incidence of adverse  events that did not differ greatly from placebo. Changes in mean ALT levels were minimal and similar to placebo. Over 28 days of treatment, the mean percentage  change in ALT from baseline was < 5% at all time points. No participant in  either trial demonstrated ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal at any time. Ubrogepant SD-OCT demonstrated linear PK appropriate for acute treatment of migraine, with  rapid uptake (time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ): 2-3 hours) and no  accumulation with daily use. Overall, there was no evidence of  ,  Context: Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been  submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks."," Context: The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is  largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited  to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman primates, and human clinical trials.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context: synergistic effect in combination with oseltamivir, thereby expanding influenza  treatment options. A Phase III clinical evaluation of favipiravir for influenza  therapy has been completed in Japan and two Phase II studies have been completed  in the United States. In addition to its anti-influenza activity, favipiravir  blocks the replication of many other RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin,  Machupo and Pichinde); phleboviruses (Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever and Punta  Toro); hantaviruses (Maporal, Dobrava, and Prospect Hill); flaviviruses (yellow  fever and West Nile); enteroviruses (polio- and rhinoviruses); an alphavirus,  Western equine encephalitis virus; a paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus; and noroviruses. With its unique mechanism of action and broad range of  antiviral activity, favipiravir is a promising drug candidate for influenza and  many other RNA viral diseases for which there are no approved therapies.  ,  Context: and positive-sense RNA viruses, which contributed the capsid protein. The  double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are distributed among several large  monophyletic groups and arose via the combination of distinct structural modules  with equally diverse replication modules. Phylogenomic analyses reveal the finer  structure of evolutionary connections among RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing  viruses, ssDNA viruses, and large subsets of dsDNA viruses. Taken together,  these analyses allow us to outline the global organization of the virus world.  Here, we describe the key aspects of this organization and propose a  comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of viruses.  ,  Context: Bluetongue virus (BTV) genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments. The  sequence of the plus strand of each of the BTV genomic double-stranded RNAs is  the same as that of its mRNA, which encodes for a single viral protein, except  the smallest S4 segment which can encode for two nonstructural proteins,  primarily for the release assistance of the viral progeny. The separation and  isolation of each BTV dsRNA segment and viral protein have provided extensive  data related to its viral infection, pathology, suppression of host cellular  functions, and eventual apoptosis of the infected host cells. This cytoplasmic  virus is also an animal killer that costs the U.S. livestock industry at least $125 million yearly. However, this virus has no known effect on humans. Thus, it  is very safe to carry out investigation with the virus, preferably in a BSL-2  laboratory.  ,  Context:  Viruses of the family Flaviviridae are important human and animal pathogens.  Among them, the Flaviviruses dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) cause regular  outbreaks with fatal outcomes. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a key activity for viral RNA  replication. In this study, crystal structures of enzymatically active and  inactive WNV RdRp domains were determined at 3.0- and 2.35-A resolution, respectively. The determined structures were shown to be mostly similar to the  RdRps of the Flaviviridae members hepatitis C and bovine viral diarrhea virus,  although with unique elements characteristic for the WNV RdRp.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) receptors.," Context: supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions.  Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug  Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome  and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for  longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in  disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid  A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept  in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept  is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring  weekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders  may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, gout and familial mediterranean  fever.  ,  Context: of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta,  initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/  Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in  CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of  these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by  cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer  half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not  tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The initial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS  suggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet  to be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other chronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and  systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept  inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought  to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy and safety in RP. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with  idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences)  or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base  treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension  period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ","22096352, 19649332, 33200890, 33229362, 32324502, 32562029",Rilonacept inhibits interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling. Microtubule composed  of tubulins regulates cell shape, migration and survival. Tubulin acetylation  has an important role in the control of microtubule structure and microtubule-based cellular functions. In this study, angiotensin II induced  disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment  with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using  RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin  II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method.  ,  Context: invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context: α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ","12024216, 26227334, 21677656, 34508164, 23126280, 22972992","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was pooled from 2 prospective, open-label,  non-interventional studies in which 1,906 patients were treated for 12 months  with either the 3-month (n = 633) or 6-month (n = 1,273) LA formulation. RESULTS: Median prostate-specific antigen levels in the pooled patient  population declined from 12.0 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL after 12 months.  Prostate-specific antigen reduction was achieved in treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients. Adverse events were documented in 8.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: These pooled data from routine clinical practice in Germany  indicate that LA 3- and 6-month depot injections can effectively reduce  ,  Context: Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent  Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the ERG review  of the company's submission, the ERG report and submission and summarises the  NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (December 2015). In the company's  initial submission, the base-case analysis resulted in an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,683 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)  gained for the sequence including apremilast (positioned before tumour necrosis  factor [TNF]-α inhibitors) versus a comparator sequence without apremilast.  However, the ERG considered that the base-case sequence proposed by the company represented a limited set of potentially relevant treatment sequences and  positions for apremilast. The company's base-case results were therefore not a  sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast. The exploratory ERG analyses indicated that apremilast is more effective (i.e.  produces higher health gains) when positioned after TNF-α inhibitor therapies.  Furthermore, assumptions made regarding a potential beneficial effect of  ,  Context:  Author information: (1)Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe,  València, Spain.

If high elagolix doses are used to control severe pain for long periods of time,  add-back therapies should be added, similar to that prescribed when using GnRH  agonists. To date, the efficacy of elagolix has only been demonstrated in  placebo-controlled explanatory trials. Pragmatic trials comparing elagolix with  low-dose hormonal contraceptives and progestogens should be planned to verify  the magnitude of the incremental benefit, if any, of this GnRH antagonist over  currently used standard treatments. The price of elagolix may impact on patient  adherence and, hence, on clinical effectiveness. In the USA, the manufacturer AbbVie Inc. priced elagolix (OrilissaTM) at around $10 000 a year, i.e. $845 per  month. When faced with unaffordable treatments, some patients may choose to  forego care. If national healthcare systems are funded by the tax payer, the approval and the use of a new costly drug to treat a chronic condition, such as  endometriosis, means that some finite financial resources will be diverted from  other areas, or that similar patients will not receive the same level of care.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"Yes, TAMs can be re-educated toward an antitumor phenotype using SPMs, opening a new line of attack in cancer treatment."," Context: plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor  progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education  toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic approach could be envisioned in cancer therapy.  ,  Context: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune  cells in tumors. TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A high TAM  infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting  TAMs with conventional therapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3241-50. ©2017 AACR.  ,  Context: receptor function can contribute to a number of disease states, including  coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and cancer. In this  chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation,  biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In  addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in  oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human  cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for  targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are  described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer.  ,  Context: still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting  strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, GFI1B is essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis."," Context: Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential  for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in  mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive  erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We  here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and  megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population  the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct  target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2  phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary  factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to  ,  Context:  In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an  ,  Context: Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of  transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Gfi1b-null embryos die at  midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To  analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice  that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid  specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full  gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to  adulthood. Both the embryonic deletion of Gfi1b by EpoR-Cre and the deletion in adult mice by Mx-Cre or Cre-ERT leads to reduced numbers of erythroid  precursors, perturbed and delayed erythroid maturation, anemia and  extramedullary erythropoiesis. Global expression analyses showed that the Hba-x,  ,  Context:  Growth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in  hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs  required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Transcription factors play essential roles in both normal and  malignant hematopoiesis. This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b  (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines. DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate GFI1B regulation, we searched for  multispecies conserved non-coding elements between GFI1B and neighboring genes. We used a formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) assay  and DNase1 hypersensitivity to assess the chromatin conformation of these sites.  Next, we analyzed transcription factor binding and histone modifications at the  ,  Context: T-cells, whereas activation in later stages leaves development unaffected. In  Gfi1 deficient multipotent precursors, Notch activation induces lethality and is  cell autonomous. Further, without Gfi1, multipotent progenitors do not maintain  Notch1-activated global expression profiles typical for T-lineage precursors. In  agreement with this, we find that both lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors  (LMPP) and early T lineage progenitors (ETP) do not properly form or function in  Gfi1(-/-) mice. These defects correlate with an inability of Gfi1(-/-)  progenitors to activate lymphoid genes, including IL7R, Rag1, Flt3 and Notch1.  Our data indicate that Gfi1 is required for hematopoietic precursors to withstand Notch1 activation and to maintain Notch1 dependent transcriptional  programming to determine early T-lymphoid lineage identity.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility.," Context: accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/.  CONTACTS: jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development and  progression of periodontal disease. Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies. We have developed a system for efficient  transposon mutagenesis of P. gingivalis using a modified mariner transposon.  Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome  junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using  Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the  library was produced. Identification of fitness of individual mutants under  specific conditions can be performed by exposing the library to selective  pressures.  ,  Context: to determine the overall average serial interval and incubation period of  COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. A comprehensive  search strategy was carried out from international electronic databases (Google  Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library)  by two experienced reviewers (MAA and DBK) authors between the 1st of June and  the 31st of July 2020. All observational studies either reporting the serial  interval or incubation period in persons diagnosed with COVID-19 were included  in this study. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I2 and  Higgins test. The NOS adapted for cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate the quality of studies. A random effect Meta-analysis was employed to determine  the pooled estimate with 95% (CI). Microsoft Excel was used for data extraction  and R software was used for analysis. RESULTS: We combined a total of 23 studies to estimate the overall mean serial  interval of COVID-19. The mean serial interval of COVID-19 ranged from 4. 2 to  7.5 days.

The CAM and MMSE served as gold standards. RESULTS: The alpha coefficient for the total NEECHAM score was high (0.88). Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution accounting for  70.8% of the total variance. High correlations were found between the total  NEECHAM scores and total MMSE (0.75) and total CAM severity scores (-0.73), respectively.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast cancer, prostate cancer, testicular germ cell tumors, and gastric cancer. A lower digit ratio has been associated with more severe disease in prostate cancer, while a higher"," Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer  according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships.  ,  Context: and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: presented with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), right hand 2nd and 4th digit  lengths were measured prior to PSA determinations, DRE and transrectal  ultrasonography (TRUS). Among these, 166 men with a prostate specific antigen  (PSA) level ≥ 3 ng/mL or abnormal digit rectal examination (DRE) prospectively  underwent prostate biopsies. The relationship between digit ratio and prostate  cancer detection rate and biopsy findings was investigated.  RESULTS: The study subjects were allocated to two groups by digit ratio (group  A: digit ratio < 0.95; n = 420; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95; n = 350). Despite  similar biopsy rates (22.4% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.544), group A had higher cancer detection rate (46.8% (44/94) vs. 23.6% (17/72), p = 0.002; OR = 2.847, 95% CI =  1.445-5.610). When we analyzed 408 positive biopsy cores (group A: digit ratio <  0.95, n = 282; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95, n = 126), group A had higher percentage of core cancer volume (46.7% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.005) and more biopsy  cores with high Gleason score (sum of Gleason score ≥ 9: 18/282 (6.4%) vs. 1/126  (0.8%), p = 0.010; primary Gleason score = 5: 12/282 (4.3%) vs. 0/126 (0.0%), p  = 0.021).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Research on early life exposures and testicular germ cell tumors  (TGCT) risk has focused on a possible perinatal etiology with a well-known  hypothesis suggesting that hormonal involvement during fetal life is associated  with risk. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and left-hand dominance have  been proposed as markers of prenatal hormone exposure. AIM: To evaluate associations between 2D:4D digit ratio, right minus left 2D:4D  (ΔR-L), and left-hand dominance and TGCT in the U.S. Servicemen's Testicular  Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study. METHODS: A total of 246 TGCT cases and 236 non-testicular cancer controls participated in the current study, and completed a self-administered  questionnaire.

AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible correlations between  right hand, left hand and right minus left (R-L) 2D:4D and gastric cancer (GCA) in men and women and assess the correlations with tumor staging and histological  diagnosis. METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed  with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained. Means for 2D:4D were compared.

The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) on 1 August 2017 and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) on 20 July 2018.," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy  for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with  hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or  newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  ,  Context: Proteasomes are multisubunit enzyme complexes. They contain three enzymatic  active sites which are termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like.  The elementary function of the proteasomes is degradation of damaged proteins.  Proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of damaged protein, which leads to  caspase activation and cell death. This relationship is used in cancer therapy.  Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  Carfilzomib belongs to the second generation of drugs, which was approved by the  US FDA in 2012. Currently in the study phase there are four new inhibitors: ixazomib (MLN9780/MLN2238), delanzomib (CEP-18770), oprozomib (ONX0912/PR-047)  and marizomib (NPI-0052).  ,  Context: Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through  hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket.  Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated  bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and  calcium levels, etc. CONCLUSION: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent  which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the  tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial  of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another  trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated  with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the  light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.  ,  Context: effect of these drugs will be limited in vivo by the development of drug  resistance, and pre-clinical studies of G12C inhibitors have identified evidence  of this. In this review we discuss the current evidence for G12C inhibitors, the  mechanisms of resistance to G12C inhibitors and potential approaches to overcome  them. We discuss possible targets of combination therapy, including SHP2,  receptor tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors and PD1/PDL1, and review the  ongoing clinical trials investigating these inhibitors.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current status of emerging therapies  for hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the United States.

The  failure is due in part to the prevalence of a reductionist philosophy and  research praxis that targets a single receptor mechanism, gene, or brain locus.  This approach fails to account for the fact that traumatic brain injury is a  very complex disease caused by a cascade of systemic toxic events in the brain  and throughout the body. Attention is now turning to pleiotropic drugs that act  on multiple genomic, proteomic, and metabolic pathways to enhance morphological  and functional outcomes after brain injury. Of the agents now in clinical trial, the neurosteroid progesterone appears to hold considerable promise. Many still  assume that progesterone is ""just a female hormone"" with limited, if any,  neuroprotective properties, but this view is outdated. This review will survey the evidence that progesterone has salient pleiotropic properties as a  neuroprotective agent in a variety of central nervous system injury models.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?",No explicit connection between isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy is mentioned in the provided context.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984. This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context:  Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disease that is likely to  develop in the embryonic period. It is caused by the intrauterine arrest of the  myocardial compaction process in the beginning of the fetal development. It is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep intertrabecular  recesses, as well as the thickening of the myocardium into two distinct layers  (compacted and not compacted). Even though this disease is said to be prevalent in the pediatric population or together with congenital heart disease, one can  understand that this disease occurs in isolation, because the diagnosis is  becoming more common in adult patients that have no other heart disease. The  ,  Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the presentation, diagnosis and management of  isolated left ventricular non-compaction in a 54-year-old Caucasian woman  presenting with progressive symptoms of heart failure. CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are  ,  Context:  Isolated left ventricular noncompaction is a rare form of cardiomyopathy  characterized by prominent left ventricular trabeculations and intertrabecular  recesses. The typical clinical manifestations are severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac embolic events theorized to  result from thrombus formation within the intertrabecular recesses.  Evidence-based recommendations for preventing thromboembolic events in isolated left ventricular noncompaction have not been established. We report the case of  a woman who, at 10 years of age, had been diagnosed with hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy without systolic dysfunction. At age 30, she presented with left  ,  Context:  Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy,  manifested morphologically as prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep  inter-trabecular recesses that communicate with the ventricular cavity. Heart failure is the most common presenting condition. Other manifestations include  arrhythmia and cardioembolic events. This report is illustrative of isolated  ventricular non-compaction in a 78-year-old woman. The diagnosis was made when she presented with ventricular tachycardia many years after a stroke. She  subsequently underwent implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase θ protects against genomic instability via an alternative  end-joining repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks. Polymerase θ is  overexpressed in breast, lung and oral cancers, and reduction of its activity in  mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,  including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the  C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase θ, illustrating two potential  modes of dimerization. One structure depicts insertion of ddATP opposite an  abasic-site analog during translesion DNA synthesis. The second structure  describes a cognate ddGTP complex. Polymerase θ uses a specialized thumb subdomain to establish unique upstream contacts to the primer DNA strand,  including an interaction with the 3'-terminal phosphate from one of five  distinctive insertion loops. These observations demonstrate how polymerase θ grasps the primer to bypass DNA lesions or extend poorly annealed DNA termini to  mediate end-joining.  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis. When  2-OH-dATP was present at a concentration equal to those of the four normal dNTPs  in the reaction mixture, DNA synthesis by h Poleta enhanced the frequency of  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of FBN3 gene polymorphism with  abnormal growth pattern in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 273 AIS patients, aged (14.6 +/- 2.1)  (10 - 18), and 287 healthy age-matched females adolescents. The anthropometric  parameters of the AIS group, including age, body height, weight, arm span, Cobb  angle, time of menarche, and Risser's sign were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used  to detect the FBN3 gene distribution. RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequency distribution were comparable between the AIS and normal control groups. There was no association with curve severity,  arm span, BMI in patients with AIS.

The kanamycin resistance gene was  expressed under the control of the promoter(s) of the putative five-gene operon.  The holB gene is essential for bacterial growth and the deletion of holB  exhibits no polar effects on the adjacent genes tmk or ycfH in terms of cell  viability.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) function. Additionally, Rif1 binds"," Context:  DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in  ,  Context: Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes.  However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and CRII) at the C-terminal region of murine Rif1. NMR analysis showed CRI to be  intrinsically disordered, whereas CRII is partially folded. CRII binds cruciform  DNA with high selectivity and micromolar affinity and thus represents a  ,  Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: dormant origins over a wide range of the chromosomes occurs in rif1Δ in the  presence or absence of hydroxyurea (HU). At the same time, many early-firing,  efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1Δ. Rif1  binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm  segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly  sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins  activated in rif1Δ. The binding to the arm segments occurs through M to G1 phase  in a manner independent of Taz1 and appears to be essential for the replication  timing program during the normal cell cycle. Our data demonstrate that Rif1 is a critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast  chromosomes.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Summarize the function of DEAH helicase DHX36 and its role in G-quadruplex-dependent processes.,"DHX36 is a DEAH-box helicase that enzymatically unwinds both G4 DNA and G4 RNA, regulating transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation, and RNA metabolism by exerting its G4 helicase"," Context:  G-Quadruplex (G4) DNA (G4 DNA) and RNA (G4 RNA) are secondary nucleic acid  structures that have multiple roles in vital cellular processes. G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We  ,  Context: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in a variety of human  cancers. However, their biological roles in these cancers remain incompletely  understood. In this study, we analyze the gene expression profiles of colon  cancer tissues and identify a previously unannotated lncRNA, FLJ39051, that we  term GSEC (G-quadruplex-forming sequence containing lncRNA), as a lncRNA that is  upregulated in colorectal cancer. We further demonstrate that knockdown of GSEC  results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context: Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box  helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing  and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two  main G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4  affinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of parallel G4s: the exposed planar face of a guanine tetrad and the unique  backbone conformation of a continuous guanine tract, respectively. Our results  also show that DSM-mediated interactions are the main contributor to the binding  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex  structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s.  Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4  ,  Context: Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences challenge the replication, transcription,  and translation machinery by spontaneously folding into G-quadruplexes, the  unfolding of which requires forces greater than most polymerases can exert1,2.

Which data simulator is available for CLIP-SEQ experiments?,Cseq-Simulator," Context: because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed  and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard  dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and  iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that  can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we  also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of  typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak  calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized gene regulation  studies and is now fundamental for the detection of protein-DNA and protein-RNA  binding, as well as for measuring RNA expression. With increasing variety and  sequencing depth of HTS datasets, the need for more flexible and  memory-efficient tools to analyse them is growing. RESULTS: We describe Pyicos, a powerful toolkit for the analysis of mapped reads  from diverse HTS experiments: ChIP-Seq, either punctuated or broad signals,  CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. We prove the effectiveness of Pyicos to select for  significant signals and show that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes superior to that of methods specifically designed for each particular type of  experiment. Pyicos facilitates the analysis of a variety of HTS datatypes  through its flexibility and memory efficiency, providing a useful framework for data integration into models of regulatory genomics. AVAILABILITY: Open-source software, with tutorials and protocol files, is  available at http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/pyicos or as a Galaxy server at  http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/galaxy  ,  Context: RESULTS: We present here an R package for the statistical analysis of ChIP-seq  experiments. Taking the average size of DNA fragments subjected to sequencing  into account, the software calculates single-nucleotide read-enrichment values.  After normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the  ratio test or the Poisson distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the  false discovery rate are obtained through random permutations. Computational  efficiency is achieved by implementing the most time-consuming functions in C++  and integrating these in the R package. An analysis of simulated and  experimental ChIP-seq data is presented to demonstrate the robustness of our method against PCR-artefacts and its adequate control of the error rate. CONCLUSIONS: The software ChIP-seq Analysis in R (CSAR) enables fast and  accurate detection of protein-bound genomic regions through the analysis of ChIP-seq experiments. Compared to existing methods, we found that our package  shows greater robustness against PCR-artefacts and better control of the error  rate.  ,  Context: GeneProf Data (http://www.geneprof.org) is an open web resource for analysed  functional genomics experiments. We have built up a large collection of  completely processed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies by carefully and transparently  reanalysing and annotating high-profile public data sets. GeneProf makes these  data instantly accessible in an easily interpretable, searchable and reusable  manner and thus opens up the path to the advantages and insights gained from  genome-scale experiments to a broader scientific audience. Moreover, GeneProf  supports programmatic access to these data via web services to further  facilitate the reuse of experimental data across tools and laboratories.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in down-regulating gene  expression. By coupling with Argonaute family proteins, miRNAs bind to target  sites on mRNAs and employ translational repression. A large amount of  miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) have been identified by the crosslinking and  immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and the photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP  (PAR-CLIP) along with the next-generation sequencing (NGS). PAR-CLIP shows high  efficiency of RNA co-immunoprecipitation, but it also lead to T to C conversion  in miRNA-RNA-protein crosslinking regions. This artificial error obviously  reduces the mappability of reads. However, a specific tool to analyze CLIP and PAR-CLIP data that takes T to C conversion into account is still in need. RESULTS: We herein propose the first CLIP and PAR-CLIP sequencing analysis  platform specifically for miRNA target analysis, namely miRTarCLIP. From scratch, it automatically removes adaptor sequences from raw reads, filters low  quality reads, reverts C to T, aligns reads to 3'UTRs, scans for read clusters,  identifies high confidence miRNA target sites, and provides annotations from  ,  Context: RESULTS: We developed CapSim, a software package for simulation of targeted  sequencing.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein is a transcriptional co-repressor protein that does not bind DNA directly but is recruited by a diverse profile of transcription factors. It has five identifiable regions, including the amino-terminal glutamine-rich"," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins)  and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of expression suggests a role for Grg4 in later stages of cell differentiation than  for the other mouse neurogenic gene homologues.  ,  Context: Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that  constitute the effector arm of the apoptotic machinery. Studies in  Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse point to  evolutionarily conserved caspase function in developmentally programmed cell  death in metazoans. Whereas in the nematode all developmental cell death is  mediated by a single caspase, in Drosophila and the mouse some caspases appear to regulate cell death in a spatio-temporally restricted manner. This article  reviews what we currently know about the roles of various caspases in the  execution of developmentally programmed cell death and what may be expected from future research in this field.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a  conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic  helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also  ,  Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context: Exploring the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration is one of the main  challenges in biology and biomedicine. Multiple examples of tissue regeneration  exist across the animal phyla, ranging from the recovery of the whole animal  (e.g. flatworms) to the limited capability of the human liver. Studies performed  in the 1960s showed that Drosophila imaginal discs are able to regenerate. This  property, together with multiple genetic tools available, make fly an excellent  model for the study of the regenerative process. Here we present an overview of  the use of Drosophila for the study of regeneration and describe major recent  advances in the understanding of this process. Current studies in Drosophila have unraveled some of the pathways and factors needed for a tissue to  regenerate. Many observations point to the reuse of developmental programs and  genetic reprogramming to drive regeneration. We discuss how this reprogramming could be orchestrated by the initial activity of the JNK pathway.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Diuretics, bisphosphonates, carboxymaltose iron, imatinib, vinca alkaloids, epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapam"," Context:  Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This  ,  Context: be classified according to whether or not they are mediated by an excess of  Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). We report two patients with the condition:  (i) A 49-year-old woman with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and gastric sleeve  surgery at 46 years of age. After receiving intravenous carboxymaltose iron in  one occasion due to refractory anemia, she developed symptomatic  hypophosphatemia. Urinary phosphate losses associated with high FGF23 levels  were confirmed. Plasma phosphate returned to normal values 90 days after the  iron administration. (ii) A 40-year-old man with a history of CML in whom  imatinib was started. He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: To provide an outline of the drugs and nutritional therapy that could  contribute to the development of hypophosphatemia in the critically ill patient. DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected. Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  ,  Context: hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal  antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia.  Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia. The administration of estrogens at high doses, streptozocin, azacitidine and  suramin may induce hypophosphatemia. Finally, the drug-related tumor lysis  syndrome is associated with hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. The prevention of electrolyte derangements may lead to reduction of adverse  events during the administration of anticancer drugs.  ,  Context: Phosphate is actively involved in many important biochemical pathways, such as  energy and nucleic acid metabolism, cellular signaling, and bone formation.  Hypophosphatemia, defined as serum phosphate levels below 2.5 mg/dL  (0.81 mmol/L), is frequently observed in the course of treatment with commonly  used drugs, such as diuretics, bisphosphonates, antibiotics, insulin, and  antacids. Furthermore, this undesired effect may complicate the use of several  novel medications, including teriparatide, denosumab, parenteral iron, and  antiviral and antineoplastic agents.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"Yes, H4K20 methylation is associated with DNA replication, as it plays a critical role in regulating chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication."," Context:  The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: not lethal and caused only minor decreases in methylation. Here, we report the  identification of a truncated DNMT1 protein, which was generated by the  disruption of DNMT1 in HCT116 cells. The truncated protein, which had parts of  the regulatory N-terminal domain deleted but preserved the catalytic C-terminal  domain, was present at different levels in all DNMT1 single-knockout and  DNMT1/DNMT3b double-knockout cell lines tested and retained hemimethylase  activity. DNMT1 RNAi resulted in decreased cell viability in WT and knockout  cells and further loss of DNA methylation in DNMT1 knockout cells. Furthermore,  we observed a delay in methylation after replication and an increase in hemimethylation of specific CpG sites in cells expressing the truncated protein.  Remethylation studies after drug-induced hypomethylation suggest a putative role  of DNMT1 in the de novo methylation of a subtelomeric repeat, D4Z4, which is lost in cells lacking full-length DNMT1. Our data suggest that DNMT1 might be  essential for maintenance of DNA methylation, proliferation, and survival of  cancer cells.  ,  Context: chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2  were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a  region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating  DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator  that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme  responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication  although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the  absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect  regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates  with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to  prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.  ,  Context: the maintenance DNA methylation. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we successfully  reproduce maintenance DNA methylation in vitro. Dnmt1 depletion results in a  marked accumulation of Uhrf1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H3 at lysine  23. Dnmt1 preferentially associates with ubiquitylated H3 in vitro though a  region previously identified as a replication foci targeting sequence. The RING  finger mutant of Uhrf1 fails to recruit Dnmt1 to DNA replication sites and  maintain DNA methylation in mammalian cultured cells. Our findings represent the  first evidence, to our knowledge, of the mechanistic link between DNA  methylation and DNA replication through histone H3 ubiquitylation.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context: remained uncertain until recently Gitelman's syndrome, the  hypokalemic-hypomagnesemic variant with hypocalciuria, was linked to the gene  encoding the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl-cotransporter (TSC) located on chromosome  16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome.

We review  the pathophysiology of these syndromes in relation to their clinical  presentation.  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, according to the context, recent reports suggest increased levels of RNA editing in squids, and it is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods."," Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural  selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This present study also suggests that linkage of editing should be considered in  elucidating the functional consequences of RNA editing.  ,  Context:  RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.  ,  Context: described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular  functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which  showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin,  the suckers and the nervous system. Finally, we found evidence for large-scale  genomic rearrangements that are closely associated with transposable element  expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of  gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive  content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological  innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Dosage  ,  Context: considered clinically relevant (GMR, 113.94%; 90% CI, 99.33-130.70). All  treatments were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse  events leading to discontinuation in any of the studies.  CONCLUSIONS: No dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required when coadministered  with ramipril or verapamil, and no dose adjustment of digoxin or ramipril is  required when coadministered with empagliflozin.

Andexanet alfa (r-Antidote,  PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) is a truncated form of enzymatically  inactive factor Xa, which binds and reverses the anticoagulant action of the  factor Xa inhibitors (e.g.: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban).

Erdafitinib was the first  orally effective FGFR antagonist approved by the FDA (2019) for the treatment of  advanced cancer, that of the urinary bladder. FGF23 suppresses phosphate  reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney; FGF23 blockade allows  phosphate reabsorption to occur and leads to elevated serum phosphate levels.  Erdafitinib and several other, but not all, FGFR antagonists produce  hyperphosphatemia. Erdafitinib binds to an inactive DGF-Din conformation of  FGFR1 and is classified as a type I½ inhibitor. Similarly, dovitinib, AZD4547, CH5183284, infigratinib, lenvatinib, LY2874455, and lucitanib are type I½  inhibitors.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by adapting its sequence to increase its complementarity to a mutated splice donor site (SDS) in a gene, thereby correcting aberrant splicing and partially restoring normal gene function. This approach has"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a disease that primarily affects the peripheral  retina and ultimately causes visual impairment. X-chromosomal forms of RP are  frequently caused by mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator  (RPGR) gene. We show that the novel splice donor site (SDS) mutation c.1245+3A>T  in intron 10 of RPGR cosegregates with RP in a five-generation Caucasian family.  The mutation causes in-frame skipping of exon 10 from RPGR transcripts in  patient-derived primary fibroblasts. To correct the splice defect, we developed  a gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 small nuclear RNA (U1). U1  is required for SDS recognition of pre-mRNAs and initiates the splice process. The mutation described herein interferes with the recognition of the SDS by U1.  To overcome the deleterious effects of the mutation, we generated four U1  isoforms with increasing complementarity to the SDS. Lentiviral particles were used to transduce patient-derived fibroblasts with these U1 variants. Full  complementarity of U1 corrects the splice defect partially and increases  recognition of the mutant SDS. The therapeutic effect is U1-concentration  ,  Context:  Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show  that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217,  including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed  ,  Context: in a large consanguineous family allowed us to identify the splice donor site  (SD) mutation c.479G>A in exon 5 of BBS1. Clinically affected family members  show symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) but lack other primary features that  would clearly support the diagnosis of BBS. In agreement with this exceptionally  mild BBS1-associated phenotype, we did not detect obvious ciliary defects in  patient-derived cells. SDs are bound by the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1), a process  that initiates exon recognition during splicing. The mutation described herein  interferes with U1 binding and induces aberrant splicing of BBS1. For a gene  therapeutic approach, we have adapted the sequence of U1 to increase its complementarity to the mutated SD. Lentiviral treatment of patient-derived  fibroblasts with the adapted U1 partially corrected aberrant splicing of  endogenously expressed BBS1 transcripts. This therapeutic effect was dose-dependent. Our results show that the adaptation of U1 can correct  pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations and suggest a high potential  for gene therapy.  ,  Context: scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly  progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well  into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria  is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed  Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal  posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations  found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%).  Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways. Potential  therapeutic strategies are developed along these lines and include RNA interference techniques and inhibition of the dominant-negative influence of  abnormally formed Lamin A on polymerization with normally formed Lamin A.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,May 2019," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class  treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This  also included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species  excreted in urine.

Volanesorsen is a  second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibiting apoC-III  transcription/translation that has been recently approved in Europe for Familial  Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the evidences on the efficacy and safety  of volanesorsen for the treatment of sHTG syndromes. EXPERT OPINION: Volanesorsen effectively reduces TG in sHTG through a mechanism  that is mainly LPL-independent, potentially decreasing the risk of AP. Some  safety concerns have been raised with the use of volanesorsen, mainly  represented by the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Due to the potential severity of side effects, some caution is needed before affirming the long-term utility  of this drug. Despite this, volanesorsen currently remains the only drug that  has been demonstrated effective in FCS, which otherwise remains an untreatable  disease.  ,  Context: postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its  high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET  scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq).  Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical  studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as  a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain. It was then  approved earlier this year by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  ,  Context: have resulted in vaccine programs for severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, some individuals remain at high risk for  the progression of COVID-19. In the US, the FDA has given Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA) for two neutralizing therapeutic monoclonal antibody  'cocktails,' casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV), bamlanivimab and etesevimab,  and one monotherapy, bamlanivimab, for prophylactic post-exposure therapy in  individuals at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Preclinical and  clinical studies showed consistent effectiveness of REGEN-COV against current  variants of SARS-CoV-2. On 21st November 2020, the FDA approved an initial EUA for REGEN-COV to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and in children 12  years or older with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at high risk for progression to  severe COVID-19. On 30th July 2021, the FDA updated its EUA for REGEN-COV for emergency use as post-exposure prophylactic to prevent COVID-19 progression in  adults and children aged 12 years or older.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, according to the context, members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including prostate, breast, colon, and lung."," Context: localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP  levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction  marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different  receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine  or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.  ,  Context:  Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists. PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-βAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to  ,  Context:  Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro  ,  Context: acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also  called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context:  Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides,  has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC),  and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides,  neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung  carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  ,  Context: The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide  receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However, a few years ago a synthetic high-affinity agonist  [dTyr(6),betaAla(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]Bn-(6-14) was described but was  nonselective for BRS-3 over other Bn receptors.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs.," Context:  When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  ,  Context: A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962  explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different  bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The  theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: During transcription, the nontranscribed DNA strand becomes  single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can form secondary structures. Unpaired bases  in the ssDNA are less protected from mutagens and hence experience more  mutations than do paired bases. These mutations are called  transcription-associated mutations. Transcription-associated mutagenesis is  increased under stress and depends on the DNA sequence. Therefore, selection might significantly influence protein-coding sequences in terms of the  transcription-associated mutability per transcription event under stress to  improve the survival of Escherichia coli. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The mutability index (MI) was developed by  Wright et al. to estimate the relative transcription-associated mutability of  bases per transcription event.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,Mitofusin 2 and GDAP1," Context: neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral  nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered  endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1)  mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth  (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal  dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). We aimed to investigate the frequency of  disease-causing heterozygous GDAP1 mutations in ADCMT and their associated  phenotype. METHODS: We performed mutation analysis in a large cohort of ADCMT patients by means of bidirectional sequencing of coding regions and exon-intron boundaries  of GDAP1. Intragenic GDAP1 deletions were excluded using an allele  quantification assay. We confirmed the pathogenic character of one sequence variant by in vitro experiments assaying mitochondrial morphology and function. RESULTS: In 8 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) families we identified 4  pathogenic heterozygous GDAP1 mutations, 3 of which are novel. Three of the  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal spinal muscular  atrophy (dSMA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized almost  exclusively by degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal  part of the limbs. One subtype, dHMN type V (dHMN-V), is transmitted by  autosomal dominant inheritance and predominantly involves the hands. It is  allelic with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2D (CMT2D), in which a similar phenotype is associated with sensory signs. Missense mutations in the  glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with  either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both. METHODS: The authors searched for GARS mutations in eight dHMN-V families. RESULTS: The authors found the G526R missense mutation in three families (16  patients) of Algerian Sephardic Jewish origin.

Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"The aim of iodine prophylaxis is to reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release by administering potassium iodide (KI) to protect against thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism, and benign thyroid nodules"," Context: emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures;  other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence.

In mouse models of thyroid  cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists  increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine.  Their effects in humans are not known. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness  to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation  with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg  twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of  iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or  ,  Context: propylthiouracil (PTU), with good effect in 3. One was resistant to thionamide  alone (CBZ then PTU) and responded to adjunctive steroids. No difference in  presentation or outcome was noted between those in whom amiodarone was continued  or stopped or between possible type 1 or type 2 AIT. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing amiodarone has no adverse influence on response to  treatment of AIT. First-line therapy with a thionamide alone is appropriate in  iodine-replete areas, thus avoiding potential complications of other drugs.  Differentiating between 2 possible types of AIT does not influence management or  outcome.  ,  Context: dosage of radioactive iodine for DTC patients with lateral neck metastasis. DTC  is an indolent tumor and may cause death even decades later. Thus, long-term  follow-up is mandatory. Recently, dynamic risk stratification (DRS) has begun to  use stimulated thyroglobulin level at 1 year after the initial treatment and  restratified the risk in accordance with the response to the initial treatment.  This DRS strategy accurately predicts disease free survival and can be widely  used in daily clinical settings. For the iodine refractory metastatic disease,  redifferentiation therapy and targeted therapy are two promising alternative  treatments. Sorafenib is the first approved agent for the treatment of progressive iodine refractory advanced thyroid cancer in Korea and may be very  helpful for radioactive-refractory locally advanced or metastatic DTC.  Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within  several years.

What are 5 key questions in human performance modeling?,1) Why we build models of human performance;  2) What the expectations of a good human performance model are;  3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are;  4) How we integrate a human," Context:  Via building computational (typically mathematical and computer simulation)  models, human performance modeling (HPM) quantifies, predicts, and maximizes  human performance, human-machine system productivity and safety. This paper describes and summarizes the five key questions of human performance modeling:  1) Why we build models of human performance; 2) What the expectations of a good  human performance model are; 3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are; 4) How we integrate a human  performance model with system design; and 5) What the possible future directions  of human performance modeling research are. Recent and classic HPM findings are  ,  Context: tools detect depression; 4) Does screening lead to diagnosis, treatment, and  improved outcomes; and 5) What are the most effective treatment methods? METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases for full-length articles published  in English between 1990 and 2010 that addressed at least 1 of our key questions. RESULTS: We identified 5 clinical practice guidelines pertinent to question 1,  and 12 systematic reviews or post-hoc analyses of pooled data that addressed  questions 3 through 5. No systematic reviews addressed question 2; however, we  identified 4 individual studies addressing this question. Current guidelines do  not recommend universal screening for depression in adults, unless staff supports are in place to diagnose, treat, and follow up patients. Reported  screening rates ranged from 33% to 84% among women. Several validated screening  tools for depression exist; however, their performance among this population is unknown. Screening in high-risk populations may improve the patient's receipt of  diagnosis and treatment. Effective treatments include exercise, psychotherapy,  and pharmacotherapy.  ,  Context: therapy (DMT) approved for the treatment of AD with a great potential for  clinical benefit over current symptomatic therapies. The scientific community  has been largely confounded by this historical decision since this has been  based on the reduction of a surrogate marker (amyloid beta) and not on data  showing clinical efficacy. Here we provide a regulatory perspective on the topic  and discuss potential similarities and differences between the FDA's and EMA's  evaluative processes.  ,  Context: Stomatodynia is a difficult disease for both patients and clinicians. When  facing true stomatodynia, i.e., idiopathic burning mouth, patients are offered  poorly effective treatment. This open study reports the results of local  application of clonazepam (0.5 or 1 mg) two or three times daily in 25 subjects  who suffered from idiopathic stomatodynia. At the first evaluation, 4 weeks  after the beginning of treatment, a visual analogue scale (VAS) that represented  the intensity of pain decreased significantly from 6.2 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.5.  At the second evaluation, 3 to 29 months after the first consultation, the VAS  scores dropped significantly further to 2.6 +/- 0.5. Analysis of the individual results showed that 10 patients were totally cured and needed no further  treatment, 6 patients had no benefit at all, and the remaining 9 patients had  some improvement but were not considered to be cured since they did not wish to stop the treatment. Blood level tests that were performed 1 and 3 hours after  the topical application revealed the presence of small amounts of the drug (3.3  ng/mL +/- 0.66 and 3.3 ng/mL +/- 0.52, respectively). The hypothesis that  ,  Context: Recently mutations in the gene ZFHX1B (SIP1) were shown in patients with  ""syndromic Hirschsprung disease"" with mental retardation (MR) and multiple  congenital anomalies (MCA), but it was unclear if Hirschsprung disease is an  obligate symptom of these mutations and if the distinct facial phenotype  delineated by Mowat et al. [1998: J Med Genet 35: 617-623] is specific for  ZFHX1B mutations. In order to address these open questions we analyzed the ZFHX1B gene in five patients, three of whom had ""syndromic Hirschsprung disease""  two with and one without the facial phenotype described by Mowat et al. [1998],  and two of whom had the distinct facial gestalt without Hirschsprung disease. Analyses of microsatellite markers and newly identified SNPs, and/or FISH with  BACs from the ZFHX1B region excluded large deletions in all five patients.  Direct sequencing demonstrated truncating ZFHX1B mutations in all four patients  ,  Context: damage. The specific endogenous factors considered attribute to 14.8% of the  total variability in the primary outcome measurements of the OTM and 6.9% of the  %tail-DNA. OTM turns out to be a sensitive parameter to detect variation, but is  also more susceptible to disturbance caused by endogenous factors than  %tail-DNA. To reduce the experimental variability in COMET assays, we recommend  a highly standardized operation protocol as well as inspecting and/or adjusting  the primary outcome measures according to endogenous factors before calculating  secondary outcome measures, e.g. DNA repair capacity (DRC) or testing  statistical inference. A human reference (HR) sample is also useful to inspect homogeneity in the temporal progression of long lasting investigations, but not  for calibrating primary outcome measurements.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I don't know the answer.," Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and  ,  Context:  Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: Extensive evidence suggests that the genetic etiologies of breast cancer (BC)  and ovarian cancer (OC) show a certain degree of similarity. This study aimed to  find out whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes SNAI1 and  TWIST1 may affect BC and OC susceptibility. A total of 7 tagging‑SNPs (tSNPs)  were directly genotyped in 1,161 BC cases, 286 OC cases and 1,273 cancer‑free  controls among Chinese Han women. Twenty‑eight variants in these 2 genes were genotyped by 'in silico' genotype imputation. Logistic regression (LR) revealed  that tSNPs SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721746 and TWIST1 rs4721745 were  protective genetic variants for BC/OC. Allelic association tests of gene‑wide SNPs demonstrated that the minor alleles of SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721745  and TWIST1 rs11973396 were strongly associated with BC/OC susceptibility.  Multivariate LR presented that SNAI1 rs6125849, TWIST1 rs4721745, rs4721746 and  ,  Context: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of  propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a dodecameric enzyme composed of two different  proteins alpha-PCC and beta-PCC, nuclear encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes,  respectively.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,Med220 and Med70 subunits.," Context:  The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Using EM and single-particle  reconstruction techniques, we recently completed a structural analysis of CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  ,  Context:  The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in  ,  Context: complex depends upon interactions between hCtf4 and multiple components of the  hCMG complex. The hCtf4-CMG complex, like the hCMG complex, contains DNA  helicase activity that is more salt-resistant than the helicase activity of the  hCMG complex. We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric  hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts  as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex. The role of the hCMG  complex as the core of the replisome is also discussed.  ,  Context:  Cristae junctions mark the boundaries of respiratory compartments in the inner  mitochondrial membrane. In this issue of Developmental Cell, von der Malsburg  et al. (2011) identify a complex, MINOS, that organizes cristae junctions. Mitofilin/Fcj1, the central component of the MINOS complex, also connects the  inner membrane to outer membrane protein import machinery.  ,  Context: C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin  family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute  inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker  of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that  CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a  native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury  it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells  and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric  subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both  classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q  and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte  recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T  cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density  ,  Context: (4)European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute,  Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, UK; Faculty of Medicine, Joint Research Center for  Computational Biomedicine, RWTH Aachen, 52074 Aachen, Germany.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs)."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context: Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here,  we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent  endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β, pro-IL-18, and gasdermin-D by activated caspase-1 resulted in the  cellular release of the mature cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and induction of  pyroptosis. Consistent with this result, a dose-dependent cytokine response was detected in the extracellular fluids of mice challenged intraperitoneally with  S. aureus EVs. Pore-forming toxins associated with S. aureus EVs were critical  for NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation of human macrophages, but not for TLR2  ,  Context: enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli strains and to examine its interaction  with host components that could be related to the infection mechanism.  Recombinant E. coli GAPDH was purified and polyclonal antibodies were obtained.  Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy showed that GAPDH is located on  the bacterial surface and released to the culture medium of EHEC and EPEC  strains. GAPDH export in these Gram-negative pathogens depends on the external  medium, is not mediated by vesicles and leads to an extracellular active enzyme.  Non-pathogenic E. coli strains do not secrete GAPDH. Two-dimensional  electrophoresis analysis showed that in E. coli GAPDH is present at least in two major forms with different isoelectric points. Of these forms, the more basic is  secreted. Purified GAPDH was found to bind human plasminogen and fibrinogen in  Far-Western blot and ELISA-based assays. In addition, GAPDH remained associated with colonic Caco-2 epithelial cells after adhesion of EHEC or EPEC. These  observations indicate that exported GAPDH may act as a virulence factor which  could contribute to EHEC and EPEC pathogenesis. This is the first description of  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive, obligate anaerobic rod, is an emerging  periodontal pathogen that is frequently isolated from patients with  periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and apical periodontitis. Recent studies have  shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal  pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector  molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and  characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their  immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density  gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission  electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270 nm in  ,  Context:  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and can be found in cell  culture supernatants and biofluids. EVs carry proteins, nucleic acids, and other  cellular components and can deliver these to nearby or distant cells, making EVs of interest as both disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. EVs in biofluids  are heterogeneous, coming from different cell types and from different sources  with the cell, which limits the usefulness of bulk EV analysis methods that report the average features of all EVs present.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: During the development and organogenesis of all multicellular organisms, cell  fate decisions determine whether cells undergo proliferation, differentiation,  or aging. Two independent stress kinase signaling pathways, p38-MAPK, and JNKs,  have evolved that relay developmental and environmental cues to determine cell  responses. Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: silencing the protein have shown antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and  to block tumor growth in animal models. Here, we review the different mechanisms  involved in ERK5 nuclear translocation and their consequences. Inactive ERK5  resides in the cytosol, forming a complex with Hsp90-Cdc37 superchaperone. In a  canonical mechanism, MEK5-dependent activation results in ERK5 C-terminal  autophosphorylation, Hsp90 dissociation, and nuclear translocation. This  mechanism integrates signals such as growth factors and stresses that activate  the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. Importantly, two other mechanisms, MEK5-independent, have  been recently described. These mechanisms allow nuclear shuttling of kinase-inactive forms of ERK5. Although lacking kinase activity, these forms  activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD  domain. Both mechanisms also require Hsp90 dissociation previous to nuclear translocation. One mechanism involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of  ERK5 by kinases that are activated during mitosis, such as Cyclin-dependent  kinase-1. The second mechanism involves overexpression of chaperone Cdc37, an  ","25840010, 18775331, 17762881, 22727621, 29129640, 27713878",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is involved in regulating gene expression through various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, mRNA decay, and translation initiation."," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages.  It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able  to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond  immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in  clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area  of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues  remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of  exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of  other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their  mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter  issue.  ,  Context: mRNA poly(A) tails affect translation, mRNA export and mRNA stability, with  translation initiation involving a direct interaction between eIF4G and the  poly(A)-binding protein Pab1. The latter factor contains four RNA recognition  motifs followed by a C-terminal region composed of a linker and a PABC domain.  We show here that yeast mutants lacking the C-terminal domains of Pab1 display  specific synthetic interactions with mutants in the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway.  Moreover, these mutations impair mRNA decay in vivo without significantly  affecting mRNA export or translation. Inhibition of mRNA decay occurs through  slowed deadenylation. In vitro analyses demonstrate that removal of the Pab1 linker domain directly interferes with the ability of the Pop2-Ccr4 complex to  deadenylate the Pab1-bound poly(A). Binding assays demonstrate that this results  from a modulation of poly(A) packaging by the Pab1 linker region. Overall, our results demonstrate a direct involvement of Pab1 in mRNA decay and reveal the  modular nature of this factor, with different domains affecting various cellular  processes. These data suggest new models involving the modulation of poly(A)  ,  Context: Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes.  Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the  mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where  holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is  altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1  exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context: for a major class of regulatory factors, the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs).  These highly conserved polypeptides are found only in eukaryotes; single-celled  eukaryotes each have a single PABP, whereas humans have five and Arabidopis has  eight. They typically bind poly(A) using one or more RNA-recognition motifs,  globular domains common to numerous other eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins.  Although they lack catalytic activity, PABPs have several roles in mediating  gene expression. Nuclear PABPs are necessary for the synthesis of the poly(A)  tail, regulating its ultimate length and stimulating maturation of the mRNA.  Association with PABP is also a requirement for some mRNAs to be exported from the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, PABPs facilitate the formation of the 'closed  loop' structure of the messenger ribonucleoprotein particle that is crucial for  additional PABP activities that promote translation initiation and termination, recycling of ribosomes, and stability of the mRNA. Collectively, these  sequential nuclear and cytoplasmic contributions comprise a cycle in which PABPs  and the poly(A) tail first create and then eliminate a network of cis- acting  ","20174964, 9790974, 21645191, 17766253, 21835917, 12844354","Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted post-translational regulation.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,I don't know the answer.," Context:  Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) belongs to a  secreted and membrane-tethered multidomain SCUBE protein family composed of  three members found in vertebrates and mammals. Recent reports suggested that zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle. However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In  ,  Context: 30-43 kDa* (p = 0.0001). In addition, marked immunostaining was detected  exclusively in the microvasculature in P. gingivalis-infected hippocampal tissue  sections, compared to sham-infected, wild-type, and TNF-α transgenic mice. This  study revealed that the hippocampal microvascular structure of P.  gingivalis-infected ApoE-/- mice possesses elevated oxidative stress levels,  resulting in the associated tight junction proteins being susceptible to  increased oxidative/proteolytic degradation, leading to a loss of functional  integrity.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: Protecting replication fork integrity during DNA replication is essential for  maintaining genome stability. Here, we report that SDE2, a PCNA-associated  protein, plays a key role in maintaining active replication and counteracting  replication stress by regulating the replication fork protection complex (FPC).  SDE2 directly interacts with the FPC component TIMELESS (TIM) and enhances its  stability, thereby aiding TIM localization to replication forks and the  coordination of replisome progression. Like TIM deficiency, knockdown of SDE2  leads to impaired fork progression and stalled fork recovery, along with a  failure to activate CHK1 phosphorylation. Moreover, loss of SDE2 or TIM results in an excessive MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks. Together, our  study uncovers an essential role for SDE2 in maintaining genomic integrity by  stabilizing the FPC and describes a new role for TIM in protecting stalled replication forks. We propose that TIM-mediated fork protection may represent a  way to cooperate with BRCA-dependent fork stabilization.  ,  Context: defective in HR-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, as well as gene  conversion at the immunoglobulin light-chain locus, an event also mediated by  HR. Gene conversions occurring in mutant cells were associated with decreased  nontemplated mutations. In contrast to these defects, we also found increased  spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and intact Rad51 foci formation  after DNA damage. Thus, we propose that FancD2 promotes a subpathway of HR that  normally mediates gene conversion by a mechanism that avoids crossing over and  hence SCEs.  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.

What is etarfolatide used for?,"Etarfolatide is used as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response in cancer treatment, specifically to identify FR-positive tumors and monitor their uptake throughout treatment."," Context: FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout  treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide  uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors,  indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion  diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized  medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FRα and FRβ in complex with folates  and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and  implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and  inflammatory disorders.  ,  Context: vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed  for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One  hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive  and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was observed in 56.4% of FR-positive lesions versus 20.7% of FR-negative lesions (P  < 0.001). Patient DCR was 57%, 36%, and 33% in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%)  patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 14.6, 9.6, and 3.0 months in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall response to FR-targeted therapy and DCR correlate with FR  positivity demonstrated by (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00507741.  ,  Context: difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with  GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome  of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those  with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI  patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone  could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug.  ,  Context: Selective heart rate (HR) reduction by I(f)-channel inhibition is a recently  developed pharmacological principle in cardiovascular therapy. Among these newly  identified HR-lowering drugs, only ivabradine has now become approved for  clinical use. I(f)-channel inhibition mainly reduces HR, thereby improving  myocardial oxygen supply, energy balance, and cardiac function. Ivabradine was  well tolerated and revealed a good safety profile in the investigated study  populations. The guiding experimental and clinical results of I(f)-channel  inhibition were compared to those of beta-blockade as a HR reducing principle as  well as cornerstone of heart failure standard therapy. Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits  beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well. Therefore,  hemodynamic effects of ivabradine and its limitations in heart failure together with the biological impact of HR reduction will be considered in this context.  Because no clinical data with specific heart-rate-reducing agents are available  in heart failure patients until now, the prospective significance of  ,  Context: patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those  analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering  orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive  effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is  granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan  drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient  for the treatment of a common indication.  ,  Context: assessed tumor cell lines, being glioblastoma the most sensitive one. This  compound was able to inhibit U-251 cells migration and tumorigenesis. Besides,  luteolin leads U-251 tumor cells to apoptosis death by depolarisation of the  mitochondrial membrane, ERK proteins phosphorylation, cleavage of PARP and  Caspase 9, further inducing DNA damage by H2AX phosphorylation, which had not  yet been described for glioblastomas.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,MethPed classifier," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: performed a pyrosequencing-based analysis for the identification of H3F3A codon  27 and codon 34 mutations in 338 pediatric brain tumors. The K27M mutation  occurred in 35 of 129 glioblastomas (27.1%) and in 5 of 28 (17.9%) anaplastic  astrocytomas. None of the other tumor entities showed H3F3A K27M mutation.  Because H3F3A K27M mutations occur exclusively in pediatric diffuse high-grade  astrocytomas, analysis of codon 27 mutational status could be useful in the  differential diagnosis of these neoplasms.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Pediatric central nervous system neoplasms include a spectrum of both glial and  nonglial tumors that differ significantly in location and biological behavior  from those of adults. Brain tumors in infants and children most often arise from central neuroepithelial tissue, whereas a significant number of adult tumors  arise from central nervous system coverings (e.g., meningioma), adjacent tissue  (e.g., pituitary adenoma), or metastases. Most adult brain tumors are supratentorial malignant gliomas, whereas the most common malignant pediatric  brain tumor is the cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor (medulloblastoma).  This article reviews neuropathological characteristics of the more common  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Advanced diagnostic imaging has provided tremendous benefits;  however, increased use of ionizing radiation modalities such as cranial computed  tomography (CT) may be associated with an increased risk of developing central  nervous system tumors. METHODS: A literature review identified studies published for more than the last  50 years from 1968 to 2018 that explored the association between head CT scans  and developing central nervous system tumors in pediatrics. We reviewed seven  studies that described and analyzed the risk of brain tumors. RESULTS: A positive correlation between exposure to CT scans and developing central nervous system tumors was evident in all cohorts. The strength of the  association varied across the studies. Exclusion of patients with predisposing  factors to central nervous system tumors was examined in four studies with a decreased risk to develop central nervous system tumors noted in three studies.  Two studies reported nonsignificant reduction in the excess relative risk per  milliGray of brain dose after adjusting for predisposing factors, whereas the  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Pediatric high-grade  glioma (HGG) accounts for ∼8-12 % of these brain tumors and is a devastating  disease as 70-90 % of patients die within 2 years of diagnosis. The failure to advance therapy for these children over the last 30 years is largely due to  limited knowledge of the molecular basis for these tumors and a lack of disease  models. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic  pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying  either K27M or G34R/V mutations.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease.," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an  enzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes  progressive dementia in children. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of  intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with  CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was  initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received  the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a 2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2  Clinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function  and 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was compared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We  also compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two  groups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more  ,  Context: was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: Management and therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionized by  the development and approval of the first biological disease-modifying  antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α at the end  of the last century. Today, numerous efficacious agents with different modes of  action are available and achievement of clinical remission or, at least, low  disease activity is the target of therapy. Early therapeutic interventions aiming at a defined goal of therapy (treat to target) are supposed to halt  inflammation, improving symptoms and signs, and preserving structural integrity  of the joints in RA. Up to now, bDMARDs approved for therapy in RA include agents with five different modes of action: TNF inhibition, T cell  co-stimulation blockade, IL-6 receptor inhibition, B cell depletion, and  interleukin 1 inhibition. Furthermore, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs)  ,  Context: The burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease remains high nowadays, despite the  tremendous development in the therapeutic strategies that has occurred during  the last 30 years. The growing focus on pharmacological strategies capable of  interacting with key pathophysiological mechanisms has resulted in a better  control of CV disease. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in many  pathophysiological processes underlying the development of major CV and renal  diseases and, thus, it represents an 'ideal' target for the pharmacological  treatment of these clinical conditions. Recently, in addition to the traditional  therapeutic approaches, mostly based on the use of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers  [ARBs]), the scientific and medical community have focused on a new therapeutic  possibility to interfere with RAS activity. Indeed, the first compound of the new drug class of direct renin inhibitors, aliskiren, has been made available  for clinical use.

Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could  serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities  of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures.

A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with  an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular  tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even  after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context:  3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer  design using patient-specific anatomical data.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22," Context: Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important  regulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans.  To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location  profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple  hemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a  gain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202  bound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose  promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol  biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, SAM2, SAH1, and others).

Ecm22 and Upc2 positively  control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12  becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in  increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of  ,  Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data  indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates. Using  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,I don't know the answer.," Context: examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: Author information: (1)Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Epidemiological reports have  suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and  increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals. Because this viremia  stays high for several weeks after treatment with antimalarials, this phenomenon  could have an impact on disease progression and transmission. The cellular  immunological mechanisms behind these observations have been studied only  scarcely. The few in vitro studies investigating the impact of malaria on HIV-1 have demonstrated that exposure to soluble malarial antigens can increase HIV-1  infection and reactivation in immune cells. However, these studies used whole  cell extracts of P. falciparum schizont stage parasites and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), making it hard to decipher which malarial component(s)  was responsible for the observed effects and what the target host cells were.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, according to the context, 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period after dental implant placement."," Context: BACKGROUND: To assess the survival rate of implants placed in the posterior  maxilla by intentionally perforating the Schneiderian membrane and protruding  the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor in cases of reduced crestal bone  height (CBH).  MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth,  accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small  percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases. Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body  tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and  bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration. Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying  dental implant failure. PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: After tooth loss, the posterior maxilla is usually characterized by  limited bone height secondary to pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and/or  collapse of the alveolar ridge that preclude in many instances the installation  of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ,  Context: comminution had not been recognised and bone grafting was not performed. The  patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation  and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel  release at 8 months. One patient had implant-related extensor digitorum communis  irritation. Another patient had non-specific chronic wrist pain, which was  resolved at one year. No patient had infection, tendon rupture, or complex  regional pain syndrome. Four patients underwent implant removal, including 2 who  had no implant-related problems.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,No," Context: Nine active neurohypophyseal principles have been isolated and identified among  the vertebrates. Arginine-vasotocin is the most ubiquitous, occurring in  pituitary glands from representatives of all the major vertebrate groups. There  is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is  ,  Context: acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female).  All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and  lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for further safety and efficacy evaluation is planned.  ,  Context:  The use of anticancer drugs is beneficial for patients with malignancies but is  frequently associated with the occurrence of electrolyte disorders, which can be  hazardous and in many cases fatal. The review presents the electrolyte abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  ,  Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic. In this paper,  ,  Context: The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed  by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. However, edema does not  improve in some patients despite adequate sodium restriction and maximal dose of  diuretics. In such patients, combination of albumin and a loop diuretic may  improve edema by diuresis and natriuresis. The response to this combination of  albumin and a diuretic has not been observed in all studies. The purpose of this  review is to discuss the physiology of diuresis and natriuresis of this  combination therapy, and provide a brief summary of various studies that have  used albumin and a loop diuretic to improve diuretic-resistant edema. Also, the review suggests various reasons for not observing similar results by various  investigators.  ,  Context: angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). In contrast to other antihypertensive  agents, aliskiren decreases plasma renin activity (PRA). In healthy human  subjects, doses of between 40 and 640 mg of aliskiren exert a dose-dependent  reduction in PRA and Ang I and Ang II levels. The bioavailability of aliskiren  is low (2%), peak plasma concentrations are reached within one to three hours  and the binding with plasma proteins achieves approximately 47-51%. Aliskiren is  slightly metabolized (20%) by CYP3A4. The most common adverse events include  diarrhea, headache, back pain and gastrointestinal disorders. Aliskiren is well  tolerated, and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren belongs to a new class of agents that effectively and  specifically inhibit the RAS. This drug functions through a novel mechanism of  action and has the potential to become a true alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the therapy of  hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal disorders.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Endometriosis, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids (leiomyomas)."," Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean  testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per  deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide  group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular  events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard  ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer,  relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was  superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

No formal statistical comparisons with degarelix were planned. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with  relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds,  respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During  treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three  months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action. PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas. Currently, several phase III clinical  trials are ongoing to evaluate this molecule in this setting in the U.S. and  Europe.  ,  Context: We here describe a case of the prolapse of pedunculated submucosal leiomyoma  through the cervix during the treatment of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH) antagonist relugolix. We also present the literature review of the cases  of leiomyoma prolapse during GnRH modulators. A 55-year-old woman with atypical  vaginal bleeding diagnosed submucosal uterine fibroid 6 cm in diameter, and  daily oral administration of relugolix was conducted. On the 35th day of the  administration, heavy vaginal bleeding suddenly occurred due to leiomyoma  prolapse. Finally, she underwent abdominal hysterectomy to treat heavy bleeding.  To date, six cases of leiomyoma prolapse during GnRH modulators have been reported, in which all the previous cases were treated with GnRH agonists. This  is the first case report of leiomyoma prolapse during GnRH antagonist treatment.  Notably, leiomyoma prolapse is a possible common adverse effect of GnRH modulators for the treatment of submucosal leiomyoma, which is caused by rapid  decrease in its volume.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the oral  gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, relugolix, in patients  experiencing uterine fibroid-associated pain.

Video demonstrating the  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context: reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its  measurable perceptual consequences.

There is no standard battery  of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions.  Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy  this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of  tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a  questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers.  Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We  introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests. By presenting standardized procedures for testing and comparing subjects,  this endeavor hopes to speed scientific progress in synesthesia research.  ,  Context:  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care  analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications. Breath analysis  with FT-IR was fast and easy, and no sample preparation was needed. The analyzer was adequately sensitive and accurate in detecting and quantitating clinically  relevant amounts of ethanol and methanol in the breath of seriously ill  patients. FT-IR spectrometry was also suitable for nearly on-line monitoring of the exhaled ethanol and methanol during hemodialysis. The breath analysis  results correlated well with blood samples. The FT-IR method used also has a  traceable calibration to physical properties of the analyte, and the measured  ,  Context: causative mutations and pharmacogenomic marker allele frequencies in various  populations around the globe.

We are currently experimenting in various visualization techniques  on the existing FINDbase causative mutation data collection aiming to provide a  dynamic research tool for the worldwide scientific community. We have developed  an interactive web-based application for population-based mutation data  retrieval. It supports sophisticated data exploration allowing users to apply advanced filtering criteria upon a set of multiple views of the underlying data  collection and enables browsing the relationships between individual datasets in  a novel and meaningful way.  ,  Context: the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate large-scale multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and hidden Markov model (HMM) database scanning for biological sequence families."," Context: Reconfigurable systolic arrays can be adapted to efficiently resolve a wide  spectrum of computational problems; parallelism is naturally explored in  systolic arrays and reconfigurability allows for redefinition of the  interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the  first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware.  RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when compared to a 2.4 GHz Core2 processor. CONCLUSIONS: Our parallel algorithm and architecture accelerates large-scale MSA  with reconfigurable computing and allows researchers to solve the larger problems that confront biologists today. Program source is available from  http://dna.cs.byu.edu/msa/.  ,  Context: Molecular biologists use hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a popular tool to  statistically describe biological sequence families. This statistical  description can then be used for sensitive and selective database scanning,  e.g., new protein sequences are compared with a set of HMMs to detect functional  similarities. Efficient dynamic-programming algorithms exist for solving this  problem; however, current solutions still require significant scan times. These  scan time requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid  growth in the size of these databases. This paper shows how reconfigurable  architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to  significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard  off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA).  ,  Context: studies is rather low suggest that aligning (parts of) those reads with a single  gap is in fact desirable. RESULTS: In this article, we present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise  short-read alignments. Apart from the standard CPU version, it includes  ultrafast SSE- and GPU-based implementations. libgapmis is based on an algorithm  computing a modified version of the traditional dynamic-programming matrix for  sequence alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the  functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the  computations by a factor of 20 compared to other programmes. The analogous SSE- and GPU-based implementations accelerate the computations by a factor of 6 and  11, respectively, compared to the CPU version. The library also provides the  user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a  variable, but bounded, number of gaps in the alignment. CONCLUSIONS: We present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise short-read  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: Due to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, genome sequencing is able to  process much more data at low cost. In NGS data analysis, the mapping of  sequences into a reference genome takes the largest amount of time to process.  Although the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used  open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that  it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment steps. In this paper, we propose a BWA-MT tool, evolved from BWA but supporting  multi-thread computation, designed to fully utilize the underlying multi-core  architecture of computing resources. By using multi-thread computation, BWA-MT can significantly shorten the time needed to generate an alignment for  single-end read sequences.

We describe two brothers from a  non-consanguineous family who have classical features of Goldberg-Shprintzen  syndrome. The novel findings in this instance are of foot anomalies including  camptodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd to 4th toes, which have not been previously described in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.  ,  Context: population approach was applied to describe the relationship between tocilizumab  and sIL-6R concentrations and subsequent changes in neutrophil and platelet  counts. Following tocilizumab administration, concentrations of total sIL-6R  increased, while neutrophil and platelet counts declined. These changes were  transient, with counts returning to their respective baseline levels soon after  tocilizumab is eliminated from the body. Tocilizumab concentrations were  described by a two compartment model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten  elimination. The quasi-steady-state target-mediated drug disposition model  described tocilizumab relationships to total sIL-6R, which allowed computation of unobserved unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The neutrophil counts were  described as a direct function of unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The platelet  counts were described by the transit-compartment life-span model with inhibition of production that depended on the unbound sIL-6R concentrations. Thus, the  observed changes in sIL-6R, neutrophil, and platelet data are consistent with  the tocilizumab mechanism of action and can be fully explained by tocilizumab  ,  Context: Purpose: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) is implicated in  several adult and pediatric malignancies, where activated signaling in tumor  cells and/or cells within the microenvironment drive tumorigenesis and disease  progression.

Olaratumab was investigated in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays using pediatric  osteosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines. In vivo activity of olaratumab was  assessed in preclinical mouse models of pediatric osteosarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor.Results:In vitro olaratumab treatment of osteosarcoma and  rhabdoid tumor cell lines reduced proliferation and inhibited invasion driven by  individual platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) or serum. Furthermore,  ,  Context: Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with  severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West  syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and  nonsyndromic epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal  seizures at age 2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The  electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated normal background frequency content but  with multifocal sharp waves and no evidence of the typical patterns associated  with Ohtahara or West syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine  effectively managed the seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we  identified a novel single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT  (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of the STXBP1 gene. This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with neonatal-onset focal seizures broadens the spectrum  of clinically relevant human disorders caused by STXBP1 mutations.  ,  Context: neutron-irradiated cells exhibited longer comet tails consisting of tiny pieces  of broken DNA in contrast to the streaking tails generated by (60)Co gamma. The  peak biological effectiveness occurred at 0.37 and 0.57 MeV; a further increase  or decrease in neutron energy led to a reduced RBE value. The RBE values, as  measured by the comet assay, were 6.3, 5.4, 4.7, 4.3, 2.6, and 1.7 for 0.37,  0.57, 0.79, 0.186, 1, and 2.3 MeV neutrons. The lower RBE value obtained by the  comet assay when compared to that for other biological end points is discussed.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6," Context: drugs include small-molecule drugs, depleting and nondepleting protein drugs  (polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies), fusion proteins, intravenous immune  globulin, and glucocorticoids. Small-molecule immunosuppressive agents include  calcineurin-inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), Target-of-Rapamycin  Inhibitors (Sirolimus, Everolimus), inhibitors of nucleotide synthesis and  azathioprine. The review covers the mode of action of these drugs with a special  focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important  ,  Context: volunteers and in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery show a  predictable pk/pd profile that allows for fixed-dose regimens. The anticoagulant  effect correlates adequately with the plasma concentrations of the drug,  demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding.  Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the  dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic  metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good  interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral  factor Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atemoya (Annona atemoya) is increasingly being  consumed worldwide because of its pleasant taste. However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the effect of pharmacogenetics on the  antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. BACKGROUND: Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by  polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP]  family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug  (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12).

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby promoting cell survival."," Context: cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic  fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context:  The ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) or ELAVL1 is  implicated in a variety of biological processes as well as being linked with a  number of diseases, including cancer. Despite a great deal of prior investigation into HuR, there is still much to learn about its function. We take  an important step in this direction by conducting cross-linking and  immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing experiments followed by an extensive computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site  and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly  uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong  ,  Context: The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of  adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an  invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA miR-29a was abundant in invasive breast cancer cells when compared to  non-tumourigenic cell types. When normal breast cells were treated with miR-29a,  HuR mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated. MiR-29a recognized a seed target in the TTP 3' UTR and a cell-permeable miR-29a inhibitor increased TTP  activity towards HuR 3' UTR. This led to HuR mRNA destabilization and  restoration of the aberrant TTP-HuR axis. Subsequently, the cancer invasion  ,  Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context: Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.  Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed  and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured  ,  Context: messages. The ARE is loosely defined as the five-nucleotide sequence AUUUA  embedded in a uracil-rich region. A transacting factor, presumably a protein,  binds the ARE and initiates recognition by the destabilization machinery.  Numerous candidate ARE-binding proteins have been proposed. We show that a 32  kDa protein in HeLa nuclear extracts characterized previously has RNA-binding  specificity that correlates with the activity of an ARE in directing mRNA decay.  Purification and subsequent analyses demonstrate that this 32 kDa protein is  identical to a recently identified member of the Elav-like gene family (ELG)  called HuR. The in vitro binding selectivity of HuR is indicative of an ARE sequence's ability to destabilize a mRNA in vivo, suggesting a critical role for  HuR in the regulation of mRNA degradation.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.," Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is  especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions  at both ends of genes. Sequence polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome  positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning. These results reveal  that sequence polymorphisms are under selective constraints to maintain  nucleosome positioning. CONTACT: zhimdai@gmail.com; issdxh@mail.sysu.edu.cn  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.  ,  Context: Most nucleosomes are well-organized at the 5' ends of S. cerevisiae genes where  ""-1"" and ""+1"" nucleosomes bracket a nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR). How  nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we  establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by  sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae  nucleosomes (displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that  the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of  statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of  the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at  farther distances from the barrier. We present evidence for a novel 3' NFR that  is present at >95% of all genes. 3' NFRs may be important for transcription termination and anti-sense initiation. We present a high-resolution genome-wide  map of TFIIB locations that implicates 3' NFRs in gene looping.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,No," Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological  processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle  atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding  partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context:  Transposable elements (TEs) are the main component of eukaryotic genomes.  Besides their impact on genome size, TEs are also functionally important as they  can alter gene expression and influence phenotypic variation. In plants, most top-down studies focus on extremely clear phenotypes such as the shape or the  color of individuals and do not explore fully the role of TEs in evolution.  Assessing the impact of TEs in a more systematic manner, however, requires identifying active TEs to further study their impact on phenotypes. In this  chapter, we describe an in planta approach that consists in activating TEs by  interfering with pathways involved in their silencing. It enables to directly  ,  Context: Mitochondria are essential and dynamic organelles in eukaryotes. Cardiolipin  (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles  in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals  and yeasts. However, CL's role in plants is just beginning to be elucidated. In  this study, we used Arabidopsis thaliana to examine the subcellular distribution  of CL and CARDIOLIPIN SYNTHASE (CLS) and analyzed loss-of-function cls mutants for defects in mitochondrial morphogenesis and stress response. We show that CL  localizes to mitochondria and is enriched at specific domains, and CLS targets  to the inner membrane of mitochondria with its C terminus in the intermembrane space. Furthermore, cls mutants exhibit significantly impaired growth as well as  altered structural integrity and morphogenesis of mitochondria. In contrast to  animals and yeasts, in which CL's effect on mitochondrial fusion is more  ,  Context:  A fraction of highly purified prolamellar bodies was isolated from etioplasts of  wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Starke II, Weibull), as previously described by  Ryberg and Sundqvist (1982, Physiol. Plant., 56, 125-132). Studies on the protein composition revealed that only one major polypeptide of an apparent  molecular weight of 36000 is present in the fraction of prolamellar bodies. This  polypeptide was identified as the NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. The highest specific activity of the enzyme in etiolated leaf tissue was confirmed  to be in the fraction of prolamellar bodies.  ,  Context: genomic DNA library. One clone (MTase-11), which gave the strongest signal at  the Northern blot, was entirely sequenced (11483 bp) and further characterised.  Under consideration of the likely open reading frames and our preliminary cDNA  experiments we propose that the clone 11 gene encodes for an approximately 90 kD  protein. As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved  sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2."," Context: alternative splicing. Herein we profiled the transcriptome of Sam68 wild type  and deficient 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. We identified 652 protein-coding genes  and 9 ncRNAs that were significantly altered with the loss of Sam68. As  expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks. Seven mRNAs (ANKRD34A, FMODA, GJA3, CNTN5, BMP10, BAI2  and HS3ST6) were involved in both networks of LNC_00035 and LNC_000466. Differentially expressed genes were involved in signaling pathways, such as  ""phosphorylation"", ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"", ""endocytosis"" and  ""MHC protein complex"".

The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD.  ,  Context: Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long  noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel,  increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and  functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To  enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have  developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in  eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry  contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization,  conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can  be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and  ,  Context: differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated  JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to  chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2  revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an  important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of  MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin  distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by  which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment.  ,  Context:  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of endogenous RNA molecules which  exceed 200 nt in length, lack complete specific open reading frame, and  completely lack or possessvery limited protein-coding capacity. Recent studies have revealed that lncRNAs participate in critical processes such as genomic  imprinting, cell differentiation, and immune reaction, etc. lncRNAs regulate  gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by modulating chromatin remodeling and histone modifications, interfering  the transcription, regulating patterns of alternative splicing, generating small  RNAs, and modulating protein activation and localization.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger  data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making  use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets  when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less  than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

It  has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the  existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An  ,  Context: open-source code of our implementation is freely available at  http://github.com/solonas13/maw . CONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being  replaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences  in terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent  words. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm  for the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.  ,  Context: An absent word (also called a forbidden word or an unword in other contexts) in  a sequence is a segment that does not appear in the given sequence. It is a  minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in the given sequence. In  this article, we review the concept of minimal absent words, which includes the  notion of shortest absent words but is much stronger. We present an efficient  method for computing the minimal absent words of bounded length for DNA sequence using a Trie of bounded depth, representing bounded length factors. This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions. We also present an approach to distinguish sequences of different organisms  using their minimal absent words.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,SpectralTAD," Context: topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to  biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors  for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their  ,  Context: mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest.

The algorithm can  data-adaptively choose between working in a given constrained model or in the  completely unconstrained model, guarding against the risk of supplying  mis-specified constraints. Simulation studies suggest that this approach can  offer 3 to 3.5 times greater sensitivity than MEME.

An R package is available  through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org).  ,  Context: Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are conserved during evolution and play  roles in guiding and constraining long-range regulation of gene expression.  Disruption of TAD boundaries results in aberrant gene expression by exposing  genes to inappropriate regulatory elements. Recent studies have shown that TAD  disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through  two mechanisms. One mechanism locally disrupts domains by deleting or mutating a  TAD boundary leading to fusion of the two adjacent TADs. The other mechanism  involves genomic rearrangements that break up TADs and creates new ones without  directly affecting TAD boundaries. Understanding the mechanisms by which TADs form and control long-range chromatin interactions will therefore not only  provide insights into the mechanism of gene regulation in general, but will also  reveal how genomic rearrangements and mutations in cancer genomes can lead to misregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,Oral suspension vaccine.," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context:  Treprostinil is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue with antiplatelet and  vasodilatory properties. It is the only prostacyclin analogue with different  options of delivery, i.e. subcutaneous, intravenous, inhaled or oral.

Pain at the infusion site has been a major drawback of subcutaneous treprostinil, hampering dose  titration, and ultimately leading to increased discontinuation rates.

Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and  liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are  available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few  interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short  half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote  in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase  their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an  approval has been granted by health authorities.  ,  Context: N.

This thorough QT study enrolled 52 healthy male and female  subjects who were randomized at a single site in a four-way crossover study.  Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 treatment sequences and crossed over  into four treatment periods over the course of which each subject was to receive  a single therapeutic dose of volanesorsen as a 300 mg subcutaneous (SC)  injection, a single supratherapeutic dose of volanesorsen as 300 mg intravenous  (IV) infusion, a single oral (PO) dose of moxifloxacin (positive control), and  placebo dose. The study demonstrated that volanesorsen 300 mg SC and 300 mg IV did not have a clinically relevant effect on ΔΔQTcF exceeding 10 ms. The largest  mean effect at any postdose time point was 3.0 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]:  0.8-5.2) after SC dosing and 1.8 ms (90% CI -0.4 to 4.0) after IV dosing. Volanesorsen, at the studied therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, does not  have a clinically meaningful effect on the QTc.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context:  The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular  ,  Context: normal karyotype and FISH results. Oligo-SNP array analysis revealed a  hemizygous deletion of 896 kb at chromosome 5q31.2, representing the smallest 5q  deletion reported to date. The deletion involved multiple genes, including two  tumor suppressor candidate genes (CTNNA1 and HSPA9) that are associated with  MDS/AML. The SNP-array study also detected 3 segments of somatic cnLOH: one  involved the entire long arm of chromosome 4; the second involved the distal  half of the long arm of chromosome 7, and the third encompassed the entire  chromosome 22 (UPD 22). Sequence analysis revealed mutations in TET2 (4q), EZH2  (7q), ASXL1 (20q11.21), and RUNX1 (21q22.3). Coincidently, TET2 and EZH2 were located at segments of cnLOH resulting in their homozygosity. Loss of  heterozygosity affecting these two chromosomes and mutations in TET2 and EZH2  are indicative of a myelodysplastic syndrome with a poor prognosis. Deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CTNNA1 and HSPA9 is also likely to contribute to a  poor prognosis. Furthermore, the original cnLOHs in multiple chromosomes and  additional cnLOH 14q in the follow-up study suggest genetic evolution of the  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7  ","18606711, 18088248, 30276444, 16777955, 25177364, 29374079",The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).,"27347137, 16777955, 18521959, 25339659, 21396113, 25541140, 16709748, 25650422, 18606711, 18682521, 30276444, 29374079"
Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,Slit proteins," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent  structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis. Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies  ,  Context: The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo  receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have  investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have individually deleted each of Drosophila Robo1's three Fn repeats, and then  tested these Robo1 variants in vitro to determine their ability to bind Slit in  cultured Drosophila cells and in vivo to investigate the requirement for each domain in regulating Robo1's embryonic expression pattern, axonal localization,  midline repulsive function, and sensitivity to Commissureless (Comm)  downregulation. We demonstrate that the Fn repeats are not required for Robo1 to  ,  Context: while limiting their peripheral toxicity. Such molecular vectors can pave the  way for the development of new classes of therapeutics, fighting against  protagonists of neoplastic development. In line with this concept, peptide  ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a  strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been  developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3)  receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic  pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med.  Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040). This compound has entered phase II clinical trials as an anti-angiogenic agent. Further studies have been directed to develop  molecular conjugates of the parent c[-RGDfK-] with conventional  chemotherapeutics or with labels for non-invasive imaging technologies. More recently, multimeric RGD containing compounds have been exploited to improve the  targeting potential as well as cell-membrane breaching, through  receptor-mediated endocytosis. The latter have been constructed on various  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine  in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine  currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the  range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2.  ,  Context: atherosclerotic lesion formation. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) analog, used in  pulmonary hypertension, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory functions.  However, little is known about its role in the MIP-1α production in human  monocytes.  METHODS: We investigated the effects of 3 conventional (iloprost, beraprost, and  treprostinil) and 1 new (ONO-1301) PGI2 analogs, on the expression of MIP-1α  expression in human monocytes. Human primary monocytes from control subjects and  THP-1 cell line were treated with PGI2 analogs, with or without  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Supernatants were harvested to measure  MIP-1α levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To explore which receptors involved the effects of PGI2 analogs on the expression of MIP-1α expression, I  prostanoid (IP) and E prostanoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-α, and PPAR-r receptor antagonists were used to pretreat THP-1 cells.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, according to the context, saracatinib is evaluated as a therapeutic target for cancer treatments, specifically targeting Src in gastric cancer, and it induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth."," Context: types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been  identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and  targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We  evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib  (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell  lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines,  saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted  ,  Context: photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of  paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as  metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so  accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment. Median time to progression was 5.7 months  for thymoma patients and 3.6 months for thymic carcinoma patients. Saracatinib  was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Src inhibition by saracatinib did not produce any radiographic  responses, though some patients did experience stable disease. Though negative, this study shows the feasibility of completing a trial in this rare disease, and  of accruing reasonably significant numbers of thymic carcinoma patients. More  clinical trials are required for this population (NCT00718809).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Src has a critical role in tumor cell migration and invasion.  Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase  inhibitor.

Saracatinib was administered at 175 mg by mouth daily for 28 day cycles until  dose-limiting toxicity or progression as determined by staging every 2 cycles.  The primary endpoint was improvement in 4 month progression-free survival. Design of Thall, Simon, and Estey was used to monitor proportion of patients  that were progression free at 4 months.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acts by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxylase (CYP17), which is involved in androgen production. Additionally, it also acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and"," Context: therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis  inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain in the optimization and further understanding of the therapy.  ,  Context: production of intratumoral androgens are necessary. The introduction of  abiraterone, a potent suppressor of cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase-mediated androgen production, has heralded a new era in the  hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context:  Prostate cancer affects one in every nine men in the USA and is the second  leading cause of cancer-related death. The treatment landscape of advanced  prostate cancer is changing rapidly. Multiple agents including abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and  sipuleucel-T have been approved for advanced prostate cancer. Appropriate drug  selection remains crucial in this evolving landscape to derive maximum benefit for the patients. We summarize clinical trials leading to recent drug approvals  and discuss optimal treatment selection. We also review recent advances in  genomics including its evolving role in prognosis, in elucidating mechanisms of  ,  Context:  It has been established that the urothelial mucin layer functions as a bacterial  anti-adherence factor. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat  patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an  immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to  determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to  demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder  urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours,  ,  Context: cancer (CRPC)--in those who are chemotherapy-naive and those previously treated  with docetaxel. Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent  disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile. Besides CYP17  inhibition, abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and  inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase--two effects that potentially  contribute to its antitumour effects. However, the inhibition of the 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11B1 and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes  leads to adverse effects and toxicities that include secondary mineralocorticoid  excess. Abiraterone is also associated with increased incidence of cardiac disorders. Under such circumstances, development of new CYP17 inhibitors as an  additional line of defence is urgently needed.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and Horner's syndrome are associated with heterochromia iridum.," Context: inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of  the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the  deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered.  Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: An 18-year-old Indian girl with upper lip deformity presented with on and off  painless swelling of her both upper eyelids for 3 years. Clinical evaluation  revealed bilateral blepharochalasis, narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure,  decreased outer intercanthal distance, iris coloboma, cleft soft palate, bifid  uvula, sensorineural deafness and double upper lip. Clinical examination of the  thyroid, thyroid hormone assay and ultrasonography revealed normal thyroid gland structure and function. Ascher's syndrome was diagnosed. To our knowledge, this  is the first reported case of Ascher's syndrome associated with iris coloboma,  heterochromia iridum, and narrowing of horizontal palpebral fissure and decreased outer intercanthal distance secondary to lengthening of lateral  canthal ligament.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: characteristic facies and deafness. The second case is an example of  Waardenburg's type I (with dystopia canthorum) with complete iris heterochromia  and characteristic facies. Bilateral glaucoma was also present in the second  case. Previously unrecognized details of iris architecture in Waardenburg's  syndrome are described. Pigmentation anomalies of the skin are also discussed.  It is hypothesized that the ocular pigmentary disturbance in Waardenburg's  syndrome is widespread and involves the hyperchromic as well as the hypochromic  areas of the eyes. A possible association with glaucoma might be explained by  such a hypothesis.  ,  Context:  Reporting one case of this condition type-2 with heterochromia iridis and  cochlear deafness.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Yes, they decrease norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue."," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context:  Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates  ,  Context: Requirements of thyroxine increase in all conditions characterized by impaired  gastric acid secretion. Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids and a long list of  drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption. In addition, a series of diseases  including celiac disease and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases, as well  as nutritional habits may be important in patient control. Finally, we mention  the effects of a growing list of drugs and thyroid disruptors that may also  affect thyroid hormone metabolism at many levels.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate  and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid  ,  Context: between groups; D3 activity in SM was higher in NTIS than controls. SM  expression of THRB1, RXRG and D2 was lower and RXRA higher in NTIS than  controls. SAT from NTIS patients had lower MCT8, THRB1, THRA1, RXRG and SMRT,  and higher UCP3 expression than controls. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with septic shock NTIS tissue responses are orientated  to decrease production and increase degradation (muscle) or decrease uptake  (adipose tissue) of T3, as well as to decrease thyroid hormone actions.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300  and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1 acetylation by nicotinamide suggests the additional involvement of sirtuin  deacetylases in S6K deacetylation. Both expression of p300 and HDAC inhibition  cause increases in S6K protein levels, and we have shown that S6K2 is stabilized  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.  ,  Context: inhibited the expression of arginase-1, fizz1, and mrc1, other genes, such as  ym,1 mgl1, and mgl2, were not affected. The inhibition of arginase-1 occurred at  the transcriptional level with the inhibition of polymerase II binding to the  promoter. IL-4 induced STAT6 phosphorylation and binding to DNA. These  activities were not affected by TSA treatment. However, TSA inhibited C/EBPβ DNA  binding. This inhibitor induced acetylation on lysine residues 215-216, which  are critical for DNA binding. Finally, using macrophages from STAT6 KO mice we  showed that STAT6 is required for the DNA binding of C/EBPβ. These results  demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. These  findings also provide a molecular mechanism to explain the control of gene  expression through deacetylase activity.  ,  Context: anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase. The first step  induces partial Ume6p degradation when vegetative cells shift from glucose- to  acetate-based medium. Complete proteolysis happens only upon meiotic entry. Here  we demonstrate that the first step in Ume6p destruction is controlled by its  acetylation and deacetylation by the Gcn5p acetyltransferase and Rpd3p,  respectively. Ume6p acetylation occurs in medium lacking dextrose and results in  a partial destruction of the repressor. Preventing acetylation delays Ume6p  meiotic destruction and retards both the transient transcription program and  execution of the meiotic nuclear divisions. Conversely, mimicking acetylation induces partial destruction of Ume6p in dextrose medium and accelerates meiotic  degradation by the APC/C. These studies reveal a new mechanism by which  acetyltransferase activity induces gene expression through targeted destruction of a transcriptional repressor. These findings also demonstrate an important  role for nonhistone acetylation in the transition between mitotic and meiotic  cell division.  ,  Context: The modification of H3 in asynchronous HeLa cells was profiled using Top Down  Mass Spectrometry. A broad distribution of species differing by 14 Da and  containing less than 3% unmodified protein was observed for all three variants.  Species of up to +168 Da were observed for H3.1, and fragmentation of all  species by Electron Capture Dissociation (ECD) revealed approximately 5%  methylation of K4 and approximately 50% dimethylation of K9. K14 and K23 were  major sites of acetylation. H3.3 was slightly hypermodified with the apex of the  distribution shifted by approximately +14 Da compared to H3.1. H3.1 (50% and  15%) from colchicine-treated cells was monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated, respectively, with equivalent modification of S10 and S28.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, Protor-1, and Protor-2."," Context: LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in  HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the  LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be reduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-ΔCT)  not binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly  enhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. Using Raptor-ΔCT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8  between mTORC1 and mTORC2. Over-expression of Raptor-ΔCT abolished formation of  the Raptor, S6 kinase, mTOR and LST8 complex, while the amount of LST8 in the  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed  that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are often activated in human diseases, such as cancer, mTOR signaling pathways are  deactivated in ischemic diseases. From Drosophila to humans, mTOR is necessary  for Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, and the regulation of Akt-mTOR signaling  ,  Context: mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are  components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.  ,  Context:  Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.  However, the mechanism by which they are recognized and targeted to the exosome  is not fully understood. Here we report that the MTREC complex, which has recently been shown to promote degradation of meiotic mRNAs and regulatory  ncRNAs, is also the major nuclear exosome targeting complex for CUTs and  unspliced pre-mRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets  these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has  only a minor role in this process. The MTREC complex physically interacts with  ,  Context: The mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that  regulates key cellular functions linked to the promotion of cell growth and  metabolism. This kinase, which is part of two protein complexes termed mTOR  complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), has a fundamental role in coordinating  anabolic and catabolic processes in response to growth factors and nutrients. Of  the two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 is by far the best characterized. When active, mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  ,  Context: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1. Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function  and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR  complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor complex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the  formation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on  mTORC2 remained elusive.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"In the UK, national systematic prostate cancer screening programmes have not been implemented due to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or quality of life in men with screen-detected disease. The National Screening Council does not recommend prostate cancer screening of"," Context: not been satisfied, and the evidence available for prostate cancer screening is  currently insufficient to warrant its introduction as a public health policy.  The natural history of screen-detected prostate cancer remains poorly  understood, and recent evidence suggests that a screening programme may detect a  large number of men with indolent disease who may be subsequently overtreated.  Several randomised clinical trials are currently in progress and it is hoped  that they will provide robust evidence to inform future practice. CONCLUSIONS: National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside  randomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or  quality of life in men with screen-detected disease. Forthcoming results of  clinical trials and the application of appropriate risk stratification to prevent overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer are likely to change practice  in coming years.  ,  Context:  Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National  Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. A number of  randomised controlled trials are under way to establish the place of routine screening of asymptomatic men. We report the possible practice of prostate  cancer screening with reference to the appropriate age range for screening, how  to screen for prostate cancer and how often, and what constitutes an abnormal result that would merit referral to a urologist for a prostate biopsy.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up.

In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, according to the context, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of  thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent  glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.  AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a blinded placebo-controlled prospective study done in 60 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (as defined by an  anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) level more than 150 IU/ml) irrespective  of the baseline thyroid status. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism who are on antithyroid drugs, patients on any other medication, which may alter the  immunity status of the patients, and pregnant patients were excluded from the  study. Patients were randomized into two age and TPOAb-matched groups; 30  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in TPOAb concentrations. Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free  thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality  of life estimation. Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody  ,  Context: in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter  modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children.

Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes.," Context: However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes  are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the  genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate  several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance,  distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that  birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative  abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and  generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that  likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about  eukaryote operon evolution.  ,  Context: activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals.  Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively  regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns  using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that  these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that  MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different  subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different  functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and  localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires  VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also  function as positive regulators of biological processes.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: The lysosomal-autophagic pathway is activated by starvation and plays an  important role in both cellular clearance and lipid catabolism. However, the  transcriptional regulation of this pathway in response to metabolic cues is  uncharacterized. Here we show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master  regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is induced by starvation  through an autoregulatory feedback loop and exerts a global transcriptional  control on lipid catabolism via Ppargc1α and Ppar1α. Thus, during starvation a  transcriptional mechanism links the autophagic pathway to cellular energy  metabolism. The conservation of this mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a fundamental role for TFEB in the evolution of the adaptive response  to food deprivation. Viral delivery of TFEB to the liver prevented weight gain  and metabolic syndrome in both diet-induced and genetic mouse models of obesity, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for disorders of lipid metabolism.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: mg/kg) by gavage in the last 4 weeks. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic changes,  cardiac calcium handling proteins, serum biochemistry, ET system and redox were  measured. The compromised cardiac function in diabetic rats was accompanied by a  significant down-regulation of the expression of RyR2, FKBP12.6 as well as  SERCA2a and PLB. These were closely linked with oxidative stress, an increased  ET-1 and up-regulation of ECE, PropreET-1 and iNOS mRNA in diabetic  cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context:  It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may  result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with  depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction. Accordingly, the effects of verapamil, a Ca2+  antagonist, on cardiac function, ultrastructure, and high-energy phosphate  stores in the myocardium were evaluated in rats made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Four weeks after the induction of  diabetes, the animals were treated with three doses (2, 4, or 8 mg.kg-1.day-1)  of verapamil for 4 wk until they were used for the measurement of different  ,  Context: SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated  ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR  ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased  in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR  Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with  insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view  that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac  complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondria are susceptible  to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and  oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause  cardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced  calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting. METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated  glucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular  calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and caspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and  Western blot analysis. RESULTS: High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium  ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: trajectory from bench research to the approval of the first anti-CGRP receptor  monoclonal antibody for clinical use in migraine prevention, erenumab, is  discussed, as well as potential clinical uses of the anti-CGRP treatments.  Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an  anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018.  At the time of this writing (May 2018), 2 other anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies  have been submitted to the FDA for the indication of prevention of migraine,  galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Galcanezumab has reportedly shown effectiveness  in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication. Eptinezumab will likely be submitted  to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants, ubrogepant and  rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication.  Conclusions - The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the  acute and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: 100 mg golimumab) and 4 developed active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab (50 mg or 100 mg) maintained clinical response through  week 54 in patients who responded to induction therapy with golimumab and had  moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis; patients who received 100 mg  golimumab had clinical remission and mucosal healing at weeks 30 and 54. Safety  was consistent with that reported for other TNFα antagonists and golimumab in  other approved indications. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00488631.  ,  Context: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) resulting from the deficiency of the C1 inhibitor  protein is a rare disease, characterized by paroxysms of edema formation in the  subcutis and in the submucosa. Edema can cause obstruction of the upper airway,  which may lead to suffocation. Prompt elimination of edema is necessary to save  patients from this life-threatening condition. Essentially, these edematous  attacks are related to the activation of the kinin-kallikrein system and the  consequent release of bradykinin. Ecallantide (known as DX-88 previously), a  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein is an innovative medicinal  product. This is the only agent approved recently by the FDA for all localizations of edematous HAE attacks. Its advantages include no risk of viral  contamination, high selectivity, very rapid onset of action, good tolerability,  and straightforward subcutaneous administration. Owing to the risk of anaphylaxis, ecallantide should be administered by a health care professional. A  postmarketing survey to improve risk-assessment and risk-minimization has been  launched. The results of these studies may lead to the approval of ecallantide  ,  Context: anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for the prevention of migraine on May  17, 2018. On September 14, 2018, the FDA approved fremanezumab-vfrm and on  September 26, 2018, the FDA approved galcanezumab-gnlm, both anti-CGRP ligand  monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of migraine. Galcanezumab showed  effectiveness in preventing episodic cluster headache as well, although has not  yet been submitted to the FDA for this indication. Both galcanezumab and  fremanezumab failed to prevent chronic cluster headache. Eptinezumab will likely  be submitted to the FDA for prevention of migraine later in 2018. Two gepants,  ubrogepant and rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal trials for the acute treatment of migraine, but have not yet been submitted to the FDA for this  indication. A press release with data on the effectiveness of daily atogepant in  migraine prevention provides some details. An announcement at the meeting suggests daily rimegepant will be tested for prevention as well. CONCLUSIONS: The development of anti-CGRP therapies opens a new era in the acute  and preventive treatment of primary headache disorders.  ,  Context: scavenging free radicals induced by radiation and chemocytotoxic agents.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity."," Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.  ,  Context: polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to  transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach  ,  Context: is lacking. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits  in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape  is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that  although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context:  Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided  structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently  associating kinase module. Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription  factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene  expression. Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation  complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing. Individual  Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that  allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional  experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction partners were repressing regulatory elements. These results indicate that  interaction chromatin loops regulate the expression of the relevant genes.

Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol  toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken  when prescribing this agent.  ,  Context:  Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of emergency and office visits. This  article reviews causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The  incidence of antibiotic-associated colitis is increasing worldwide as a consequence of widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for various  illnesses. The pathogenic organism, Clostridium difficile, produces two  enterotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal inflammation.
