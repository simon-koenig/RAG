Luciferase assays and functional  experiments showed that the circular multi-miR sponge was more stable than its  linear counterpart. Moreover, endogenous miR-21 and miR-93 were inhibited by the  ,  Context: It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost  always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to  produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding  genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of  which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs.  How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or  a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements,  including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this  decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This  brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and  facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can  be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another.

Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were:  42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.

Chronic administration of either  metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance.

The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt.

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation throughout the human genome.," Context: Despite the fact that 45% of all human gene promoters do not contain CpG  islands, the role of DNA methylation in control of non-CpG island promoters is  controversial and its relevance in normal and pathological processes is poorly  understood. Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA  methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority  do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription  silencing of these genes.

However, the  debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high  nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels  of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA,  while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of  methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these  conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines  MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ gene in mammalian genomes encodes for DNA polymerase theta (pol θ).," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C) are introduced due to directional mutation pressure.," Context: different levels of AlkA produced an increased spontaneous mutation frequency  correlated with the expression levels, indicating that excision of normal bases  occurs at biologically significant rates. We propose that the broad specificity  3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases represent a general type of repair enzyme  'pulling' bases in DNA largely at random, without much preference for a specific  structure. The specificity for release of damaged bases occurs because base  structure alterations cause instability of the base-sugar bonds. Damaged bases  are therefore released more readily than normal bases once the bond activation  energy is reduced further by the enzyme. Qualitatively, the model correlates quite well with the relative rate of excision observed for most, if not all, of  the substrates described for AlkA and analogues.  ,  Context: different levels of AlkA produced an increased spontaneous mutation frequency  correlated with the expression levels, indicating that excision of normal bases  occurs at biologically significant rates.

Recently, dynamic risk stratification (DRS) has begun to  use stimulated thyroglobulin level at 1 year after the initial treatment and  restratified the risk in accordance with the response to the initial treatment.  This DRS strategy accurately predicts disease free survival and can be widely  used in daily clinical settings. For the iodine refractory metastatic disease,  redifferentiation therapy and targeted therapy are two promising alternative  treatments. Sorafenib is the first approved agent for the treatment of progressive iodine refractory advanced thyroid cancer in Korea and may be very  helpful for radioactive-refractory locally advanced or metastatic DTC.  Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within  several years.

However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental  relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In  addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.

Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Epistaxis is a minor complication associated with dental implant placement, specifically when an intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane is made using a 2mm twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm"," Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material.

Sequence lengths are constrained only by  available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation  can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz. The  boards are completely functional, and yield a 15-fold performance improvement  over an unassisted host.  ,  Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically).

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.

Using  high-throughput sequencing to map ORC binding and nucleosome positioning, we  show that yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned nucleosomes flanking the ACS. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a  nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of  nucleosomes flanking the origin.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no mention of desmin being present in plants.

Symptoms typically appear in the second to third decades of life, but in the  most severe cases can manifest themselves earlier. How desmin mutations lead to  aberrant muscle function, however, remains poorly defined. We created a series  of four mutations in rat desmin and tested their in vitro filament assembly  properties. RDM-G, a chimera between desmin and green fluorescent protein,  formed protofilament-like structures in vitro. RDM-1 and RDM-2 blocked in vitro  assembly at the unit-length filament stage, while RDM-3 had more subtle effects  on assembly. When expressed in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes via adenovirus infection, these mutant proteins disrupted the endogenous desmin  filament to an extent that correlated with their defects in in vitro assembly  properties. Disruption of the desmin network by RDM-1 was also associated with disruption of plectin, myosin, and alpha-actinin organization in a significant  percentage of infected cells.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.," Context: In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs,  ,  Context: In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.

TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs,  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons. We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.  ,  Context: Spliced leader trans-splicing is an mRNA maturation process used by a small set  of eukaryotes, including the nematode C. elegans, to cap the downstream genes of  operons.
