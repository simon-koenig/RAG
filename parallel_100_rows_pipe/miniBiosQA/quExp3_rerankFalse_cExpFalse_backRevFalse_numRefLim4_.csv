Thereby, the tool provides a straightforward solution for evaluating any list of expected mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest. In addition to an ordinary textual report, BBCAnalyzer reports highly customizable plots. Information on the counted number of bases, the reference bases, known mutations or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single plot. By uniting this information in a graphical way, the user may easily decide on a variant being present or not - completely independent of any internal filters or frequency thresholds.",28241736

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.
