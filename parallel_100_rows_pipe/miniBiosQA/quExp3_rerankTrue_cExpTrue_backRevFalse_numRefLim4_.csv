What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that cohesin subunits, which include STAG1 and STAG2, mediate genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"There is no mention of glioblastoma in the provided text. However, it does mention glioma, which has an odds ratio (OR) of 1.15 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.65-2."," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen.

The aim of this document  by the European Headache Federation (EHF) is to provide an evidence-based and  expert-based guideline on the use of the monoclonal antibodies acting on the  calcitonin gene-related peptide for migraine prevention. METHODS: The guideline was developed following the Grading of Recommendation,  Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group  identified relevant questions, performed systematic review and analysis of the  literature, assessed the quality of available evidence, and wrote recommendations. Where the GRADE approach was not applicable, expert opinion was  provided. RESULTS: We found low to high quality of evidence to recommend eptinezumab,  erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine and medium to high quality of evidence to recommend erenumab, fremanezumab, and  galcanezumab in patients with chronic migraine. For several clinical questions,  there was not enough evidence to provide recommendations using the GRADE  ,  Context: due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58)  and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at  baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group  after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05).

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue."," Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: from the familiar slide-based assays of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in  situ hybridization to the nonmorphology-driven molecular platforms of  quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and genomic  microarray profiling. In this review, 14 multigene assays are evaluated as to  their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval  status, and estimated cost-benefit ratio. Emphasis is placed on two tests:  oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Current evidence indicates that the oncotype DX test  has the advantages of earlier commercial launch, wide acceptance for payment by  third-party payors in the U.S., ease of use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, recent listing by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast  Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee as recommended for use, continuous scoring  system algorithm, ability to serve as both a prognostic test and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated  cost-effectiveness in one published study, and a high accrual rate for the  prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options  ,  Context: nucleotide changes within the mutation cluster at codons 12 and 13, with a  sequence output in the sense direction to facilitate results interpretation.

All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS)  ,  Context:  Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).

This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed.

It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma.

The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context: is the speed of death in a majority of cases rapid but also the images of the  cause of death such as bleeding from various orifices gruesome and frightening.

Finally,  there is a clear perceived notion that such an agent can be utilized as a  bioterrorism agent that adds to the apprehension. Thus, in efforts to gain an  objective view of the growing threat Ebolavirus poses to the general public, it  is important to provide some basic understanding for the lethality of Ebolavirus infection that is highlighted in Fig. 1. This virus infection first appears to  disable the immune system (the very system needed to fight the infection) and  subsequently disables the vascular system that leads to blood leakage (hemorrhage), hypotension, drop in blood pressure, followed by shock and death.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages) can be both tumor-promoting and antitumor effector functions.

Therefore, targeting TAMs"," Context:  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising therapeutic target for cancer  immunotherapy, while TAMs targeting therapy using nano-sized drug delivery  system (NDDS) is a great challenge. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel erythrocyte-cancer cell hybrid membrane camouflaged pH-responsive copolymer  micelle (dextran-grafted-poly (histidine) copolymer) was prepared to target  deliver a selective CSF-1R inhibitor: BLZ-945 (shorten as DH@ECm) to TAMs for TAMs depletion.

In tumor acidic  ,  Context: that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor  progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic approach could be envisioned in cancer therapy.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer.

Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: enhancing antitumor responses.

Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA  methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority  do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription  silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by  5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation  occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly  lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in  vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a  single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a  nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start  site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin  configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is  methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically  ,  Context: closed chromatin regions prevent the activity of transcriptional machinery.

Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Diuretics, bisphosphonates, carboxymaltose iron, antacids, catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are associated with drug-induced hypoph"," Context: Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia  frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypophosphatemia are  usually mild but might also be severe and potentially life-threatening. This review aims at a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological  mechanisms and risk factors of drug therapy-related hypophosphatemia thus  allowing prevention and effective intervention strategies.  ,  Context:  Hypophosphatemia is a relatively frequent and a potentially serious adverse drug  effect. Clinically it is characterized by bone pain and muscle weakness. There  are several mechanisms by which a drug can induce hypophosphatemia and they can be classified according to whether or not they are mediated by an excess of  Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). We report two patients with the condition:  (i) A 49-year-old woman with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and gastric sleeve surgery at 46 years of age. After receiving intravenous carboxymaltose iron in  one occasion due to refractory anemia, she developed symptomatic  hypophosphatemia.

CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected.  Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism.

Functional expression of PfNT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes  significantly increases their ability to take up naturally occurring D-adenosine  (K(m) = 13.2 microM) and D-inosine (K(m) = 253 microM). Significantly, PfNT1,  unlike the mammalian nucleoside transporters, also has the capacity to transport  the stereoisomer L-adenosine (K(m) > 500 microM). Inhibition studies with a  battery of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as well as their analogs  indicate that PfNT1 exhibits a broad substrate specificity for purine and  pyrimidine nucleosides. These data provide compelling evidence that PfNT1 encodes a functional purine/pyrimidine nucleoside transporter whose expression  is strongly developmentally regulated in the asexual stages of the P. falciparum  life cycle. Moreover, the unusual ability to transport L-adenosine and the vital contribution of purine transport to parasite survival makes PfNT1 an attractive  target for therapeutic evaluation.  ,  Context:  Prokaryotic, eukaryotic and mitochondrial DNA sequences of total Length 300 000  nucleotides have been analyzed to find out whether stretches of alternating  purines and pyrimidines are unusual in terms of occurrence, composition and base sequence.

Octanucleotides are the most deficient, occurring at only 60% of the frequency expected in random sequences. An unexpectedly high proportion of these octamers  consists of alternating tetramers with the repeat structure (PuPyPuPy)2 or  (PyPuPyPu)2.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after a nuclear reactor accident.," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer.," Context: Upon exposure to various environmental stresses such as arsenite, hypoxia, and  heat shock, cells inhibit their translation and apoptosis and then repair  stress-induced alterations, such as DNA damage and the accumulation of misfolded  proteins. These types of stresses induce the formation of cytoplasmic RNA  granules called stress granules (SGs). SGs are storage sites for the many mRNAs  released from disassembled polysomes under these stress conditions and are essential for the selective translation of stress-inducible genes.  Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a  component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. In this study, we examined the role of G3BP2, a close relative of G3BP1, in SG  formation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells  partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the  ,  Context: Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the  cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of  non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal  transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate  an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of  stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid  multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can  be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by  TPEN. In addition, Zn2+ is released in cells treated with arsenite, before  stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological  ,  Context: primary culture, and in wounded human or animal tissue. Evidence from these  models indicates that migration is a highly complex process, which is likely to  involve the tightly controlled spatial and temporal interaction of multiple  factors: (i) extracellular molecules such as soluble factors (e.g. growth  factors, trefoil peptides, cytokines) and matrix components (e.g. collagen,  laminin, fibronectin); (ii) signalling molecules activated by the interaction of  these factors with cell surface receptors (e.g. protein kinases, phospholipases,  low-molecular-weight GTPases); (iii) factors which regulate adhesion to other  cells (e.g. E-cadherin) and to matrix components (e.g. integrins, hyaluronic acid receptors); (iv) factors which regulate detachment from the extracellular  matrix (e.g. urokinase-type plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteinases);  and (v) molecules which regulate cytoskeletal function (e.g. Rac), which allows the formation of specialized cellular processes termed lamellipodia. 3. The  identification of physiologically relevant factors that stimulate epithelial  cell migration, and a better understanding of their mechanism of action, may be  ,  Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes.

Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as  observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In  addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in  PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected  cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated  p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78.  CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that although function of PABPN1 may be  compensated by nuclear translocation of PABP4 and perhaps by increase in the  cytoplasmic abundance of PABP5, these were not sufficient to prevent apoptosis of cells. Thus PABPN1 may have a novel anti apoptotic role in mammalian cells.

However, it does mention that the ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for clinical implant"," Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: engineering.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is a related transcription factor and a paralog of UPC2 in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered.

Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication.

Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation.

One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration.

Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration.

This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The Heyde syndrome describes the coincidence of aortic valve  stenosis and intestinal bleeding. The pathophysiologic link between both  entities has remained unclear so far. In several studies the intestinal  bleedings have been attributed to angiodysplasia. Cessations of the intestinal  bleedings following replacement of the aortic valve have been described by  numerous reports. CASE REPORT: We describe the history of a 70-year-old man with a calcified  aortic valve stenosis. In addition, he suffered from recurrent severe epistaxis  over several years. Replacement of the aortic valve by bioprosthesis resulted in  complete cessation of the nasal bleedings over a follow-up period of 6 years. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that aortic valve stenoses may be  associated with extraintestinal bleedings as well.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR promotes the stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. In ZFP36-knockout mouse fibroblasts, increased stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were observed, leading"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context: Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.  Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed  and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: determine whether these trans-acting factors are likely to play a role in  embryogenesis, we have analysed their expression during mouse development both  at the mRNA and protein levels. We show that AUF1 and HuR are expressed at all  the developmental stages analysed from day 8.5 of embryonic development to  adulthood. Expression levels are dynamic, varying between tissues and  developmental stages. However, a strong positive correlation between AUF1 and  HuR protein levels was observed in all examined tissues. Finally, we compared  AUF1 and HuR expression with accumulation of one common target mRNA, c-myc. The  similar spatio-temporal distribution of these proteins and of c-myc mRNA is in agreement with a potential concerted role in ARE-mediated control of mRNA  stability.  ","23223443, 11280780, 23401122, 11103939","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"

Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments.

This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions. We also present an approach to distinguish sequences of different organisms  using their minimal absent words. Our solution applies a length-weighted index  to discriminate sequences and the results show that we can build phylogenetic tree based on the patent collected information.  ,  Context: on a fixed-sized alphabet based on the construction of suffix automata  (Crochemore et al., 1998).

Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously.

Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473).

Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins.

Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. Selenium-dependent enzymes have modifying effects on the immune system, and even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."," Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains.
