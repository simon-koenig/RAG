What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ","19270706, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that they retain partially overlapping functions and are involved in cell proliferation, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes, but their specific involvement in differentiation"," Context: alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions.  We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: Lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that support nuclear membranes.  They are divided into A-type lamins, which include lamin A and C, and B-type  lamins, which include lamin B1 and B2. In the rat brain, lamin A and C are  expressed in relatively equal amounts, while the expressions of lamin B1 and B2  vary depending on the cell type. Lamins play important roles in normal  morphogenesis and function. In the nervous system, their abnormal expression causes several neurodegenerative diseases such as peripheral neuropathy,  leukodystrophy and lissencephaly. The retina belongs to the central nervous  system (CNS) and has widely been used as a source of CNS neurons. We investigated the expression patterns of lamin subtypes in the adult rat retina  by immunohistochemistry and found that the staining patterns differed when  compared with the brain.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in any genome. It has been tested as a case study on the fly genome.," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based approaches that rely on tissue  protoplasting to isolate distinct cell populations. Additionally, no tissue  fixation is necessary as in laser capture microdissection-based techniques,  which allows high-quality RNA to be obtained. However, sampling from  subpopulations of cells and only isolating polysome-associated RNA severely  limits RNA yields. It is, therefore, necessary to apply sufficiently sensitive  library preparation methods for successful data acquisition by RNA-seq. TRAP  offers an ideal tool for plant research as many developmental processes involve  cell wall-related and mechanical signaling pathways. The use of promoters to target specific cell populations is bridging the gap between organ and  single-cell level that in turn suffer from little resolution or very high costs.  Here, we apply TRAP to study cell-cell communication in lateral root formation.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area.," Context: Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and  are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually  every brain area. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS).  Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are  strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS is a small  soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as  phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy  bodies contain abundant phosphorylated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS. However, alternative splicing of the AS gene is also known to modify AS  aggregation propensities. Splicing gives rise to four related forms of the  protein, the main transcript and those that lack exon 4, exon 6, or both. Since  ,  Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease.

They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies.

RESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 ± 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent  polysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without  current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"Dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria, and diatoms may produce tetrodotoxin."," Context: Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to produce a  diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood in terms of  their main targets and biological function. Toxins such as saxitoxins,  tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced  in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and  accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator organisms, including human populations, leading in some  cases to death. Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of  aquatic organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep does not increase genetic variation. In fact, it leads to a reduction in linked variation due to genetic hitchhiking, creating regions of reduced variation around the adaptive site."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region.

List markers for autophagy.,"ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1) and SQSTM1 are markers for autophagy."," Context: Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily  conserved catabolic process necessary for normal recycling of cellular  constituents and for appropriate response to cellular stress. Although several  genes belonging to the core molecular machinery involved in autophagosome  formation have been discovered, relatively little is known about the nature of  signaling networks controlling autophagy upon intracellular or extracellular stimuli. We discovered ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP and GABARAPL1) as  novel interactors of MAPK15/ERK8, a MAP kinase involved in cell proliferation  and transformation. Based on the role of these proteins in the autophagic process, we demonstrated that MAPK15 is indeed localized to autophagic  compartments and increased, in a kinase-dependent fashion, ATG8-like proteins  lipidation, autophagosome formation and SQSTM1 degradation, while decreasing  ,  Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus of immediate-early genes (IEGs) frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes and even activation in surrounding"," Context: Immediate-early (IE) genes are the first class of viral genes expressed after  primary infection or reactivation. As transcription of IE genes does not require  prior viral protein synthesis, this class of genes is experimentally defined by  their transcription following primary infection or reactivation in the presence  of inhibitors of protein synthesis. This chapter describes an approach to  identify IE genes in a novel herpesvirus genome. Transcription of IE genes is selectively induced with sodium butyrate in the presence of the protein  synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The transcripts of the induced genes are  identified by using a cDNA subtraction-based method of gene expression  screening.  ,  Context: Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently  controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome  analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the  most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes.

Since clotting factors became available,  uncontrolled perioperative bleeding is a less significant problem for surgeons in developed countries. However, they are more difficult to come by in China.  Additionally, patients often have to undergo surgery for giant masses and suffer  complications.

This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had  photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol)  with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription."," Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) do not encode proteins and are involved in many physiological processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases.

Using an improved computational approach for circular RNA identification, we  found widespread circular RNA expression in Drosophila melanogaster and estimate  that in humans, circular RNA may account for 1% as many molecules as poly(A)  RNA. Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for  each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each  gene were cell-type specific. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression  program.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,X-ray free electron laser is used at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).," Context: Matter with a high energy density (>10(5) joules per cm(3)) is prevalent  throughout the Universe, being present in all types of stars and towards the  centre of the giant planets; it is also relevant for inertial confinement  fusion. Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure,  requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous  temperatures and densities. With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source  (LCLS) X-ray laser, high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2),  previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths.  The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been investigated. An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray  interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for  applications. Here we report the experimental creation of a solid-density plasma at temperatures in excess of 10(6) kelvin on inertial-confinement timescales  using an X-ray free-electron laser.

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum.," Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse  small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition  is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that  share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established at the Public Health Agency of Canada with COVID-19 literature was searched for  articles referencing MIS-C, PIMS or Kawasaki Disease in relation to COVID-19.

AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura.  EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine  medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated in large placebo-controlled studies and ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg was  superior, even if the therapeutic gain seems to be low. Nevertheless, the  favorable safety profile compared to other abortive drugs makes ubrogepant a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)  receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,I am uncertain about which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept as there is no mention of rilonacept in the provided context.," Context: pathway have recently been completed. In patients with severe, uncontrolled  asthma, targeting IL-13 alone with biologics including lebrikizumab and  tralokinumab has not shown consistent reduction in asthma exacerbations.  Simultaneous targeting of both IL-4 and IL-13 by blocking IL-4 receptor α using  dupilumab has yielded more consistent results in reducing asthma exacerbations  and improving lung function, especially in patients with increased blood  eosinophils. Other biomarkers of T2 inflammation such as exhaled nitric oxide  and serum periostin may also predict response to biologics targeting the  IL-4/IL-13 pathway. SUMMARY: No biologic targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is currently available for treatment of asthma, but emerging data suggest that biologics targeting IL-4 and  IL-13 together may benefit patients with T2 high asthma. Additional data are  needed about long-term efficacy and safety prior to incorporating these drugs into routine clinical practice.  ,  Context: Impaired healing of the skin is a notable cause of patient morbidity and  mortality.

The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by  using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only  pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule  stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in  MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules.  Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in  the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that  the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to  ","12024216, 23798680","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214"

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs can be either proinflammatory/antitumor or anti-inflammatory/protumor, depending on the tumor microenvironment stimuli. Therefore, it is uncertain whether TAMs are good anticancer therapeutic targets as their role in cancer progression is complex"," Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment.

In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC),  myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC,  megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in  definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive  ,  Context: Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic  progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors  through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The  transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main  downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification  of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT.  GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation  of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change  characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues.

The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls.

They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis. Aims Autosomal-dominant as well as X-linked inheritance for  NCCM has been described and several loci have been associated with the disease.  Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.  Methods and Results We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin  heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,"POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) in mammalian cells, including humans."," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol θ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered).

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S. cerevisiae genome by controlling their activity during S-phase, which is thought to involve chromatin structure and organization into timing domains with differential ability to recruit limiting replication factors"," Context: Chromosomal DNA replication involves the coordinated activity of hundreds to  thousands of replication origins. Individual replication origins are subject to  epigenetic regulation of their activity during S-phase, resulting in  differential efficiencies and timings of replication initiation during S-phase.  This regulation is thought to involve chromatin structure and organization into  timing domains with differential ability to recruit limiting replication  factors. Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of  replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells. However, previous  studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1's role in controlling replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  ,  Context:  Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten  during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length  equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level. The prevailing protein-counting  model for regulating telomerase access to elongate the telomere does not explain  accumulating evidence of a role of DNA replication in telomere length regulation. Here I present an alternative model: the replication fork model that  can explain how passage of a replication fork and regulation of origin firing  affect telomere length.  ","24879017, 27401551","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","19948482, 24462468, 22279046, 23809990, 24634216, 24879017, 24532715, 22850673, 22850674, 24685139, 24656819, 15342490"

We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism.

However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context:  RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers  ","29048557, 28388405","Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone are the two drugs combined in a single pill of Avandamet.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics through a mechanism called U1 Adaptors, where bifunctional oligonucleotides are designed to bind to a target gene's terminal exon and also to the U1 snRNP sp"," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements.

These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context: lung cancer type while c-myc and L-myc can be expressed in both small cell and  non-small cell lung cancers. Many lung cancers of all histologic types also  express large amounts of p53, which are not correlated with the amount or type  of myc gene product expressed. In small cell lung cancer, high levels of myc  gene expression are usually associated with gene amplification, and not  uncommonly there is rearrangement of some of the amplified copies. In non-small  cell lung cancer, expression without amplification or rearrangement of myc genes  is seen. In contrast, high level expression of p53 is not associated with gene  amplification in any lung cancer type. In addition, to these proto-oncogenes acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and few or no other growth factors added.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria.

According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.

Additionally, there is a stable endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both Med220 and Med70 subunits, indicating that"," Context: The human CRSP-Med coactivator complex is targeted by a diverse array of  sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Using EM and single-particle  reconstruction techniques, we recently completed a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med. Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is demonstrated by the fact that EVs were purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain."," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically through its α2 isoform which associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP (Poly(A) Polymerase) is involved in controlling the expression of select mRNAs by regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Specifically, it works together with PIPKIalpha to regulate the"," Context: set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha.  Here we show that PIPKIalpha co-localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with  a newly identified non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which we have termed  Star-PAP (nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIalpha regulated-poly(A) polymerase) and  that the activity of Star-PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P2.  Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha function together in a complex to control the expression  of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme  haem oxygenase-1 (refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by  regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data demonstrate a model by which phosphoinositide signalling works in tandem with  complement pathways to regulate the activity of Star-PAP and the subsequent  biosynthesis of its target mRNA. The results reveal a mechanism for the integration of nuclear phosphoinositide signals and a method for regulating gene  expression.  ,  Context: Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a  crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  Recently, new roles for succinate outside metabolism have emerged. Succinate  stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in  specific tumors and in activated macrophages, and stimulates dendritic cells via  its receptor succinate receptor 1. Furthermore, succinate has been shown to post-translationally modify proteins. This expanding repertoire of functions for  succinate suggests a broader role in cellular activation.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express FRα (folate receptor alpha). It is taken up," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,"The MethPed classifier, implemented in an R package, can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups."," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies. Diffuse  high-grade gliomas represent approximately 10% of pediatric brain tumors. Exon  sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A  K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be  seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse  high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. We  performed a pyrosequencing-based analysis for the identification of H3F3A codon  27 and codon 34 mutations in 338 pediatric brain tumors. The K27M mutation  occurred in 35 of 129 glioblastomas (27.1%) and in 5 of 28 (17.9%) anaplastic astrocytomas. None of the other tumor entities showed H3F3A K27M mutation.  Because H3F3A K27M mutations occur exclusively in pediatric diffuse high-grade  astrocytomas, analysis of codon 27 mutational status could be useful in the differential diagnosis of these neoplasms.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,I am uncertain about the specific organs for which 3D printing has been tested.," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are of human laryngeal cancer origin.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context:  Luteolin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, possesses anti-cancer activities  against several human cancers, but the exact molecular and biochemical  mechanisms of above findings are not very clear, and its activity against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. In a study of 56 patients with reduced CBH who received 63 implants in the posterior maxilla, 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period."," Context: MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to  ,  Context: of dental implants.

A decline of arterial pressure in the systemic  circulation is counter-regulated by vasoconstriction in the arteriolar vascular  bed; the compensatory vasoconstriction, however, results in an increased  afterload that in turn aggravates myocardial pump deficiency. As part of the  counterregulatory systems the sympathetic nervous system is activated (increase  of neuronal activity, increased plasma norepinephrine) and the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated as well (increased plasma  renin activity, elevated angiotensin II serum levels, hyperaldosteronism). In parallel, serum levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is despite a serum  hypoosmolarity increased and only poorly compensated by release of the atrial  natriuretic peptide. On the cellular level, congestive heart failure leads to a shift of the expression of contractile proteins towards to fetal forms (for  instance myosin-isoenzymes).

List R packages for lipidomics,lipidr is an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. Another R package mentioned is Rodin.," Context: The rapid evolution of mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics has enabled the  simultaneous measurement of numerous lipid classes. With lipidomics datasets  becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required  to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating  lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and  unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets.  lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for  targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically  inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through  integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and  ,  Context: options (e.g. lipid subclass and individual fatty acid chains).

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6 is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market.," Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences.

In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and  maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are  differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR stabilizes mRNA subsets in fibroblasts and regulates the induction of HO-1 by NO. Additionally, HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby promoting cell survival"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: mRNAs showed at least one hit of a signature motif for the stabilizing  RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR; accordingly, ribonucleoprotein  immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that all seven mRNAs associated with HuR.  In keeping with a functional role of HuR in the response to NO, a measurable  fraction of HuR increased in the cytoplasm following NO treatment. However,  among the seven transcripts, only HO-1 mRNA showed a robust increase in the  level of its association with HuR following NO treatment. In turn, HO-1 mRNA and  protein levels were significantly reduced when HuR levels were silenced in  IMR-90 cells, and they were elevated when HuR was overexpressed. In sum, our results indicate that NO stabilizes mRNA subsets in fibroblasts, identify HuR as  an RBP implicated in the NO response, reveal that HuR alone is insufficient for  stabilizing several mRNAs by NO, and show that HO-1 induction by NO is regulated  by HuR.  ","19884656, 19289500","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization in budding yeast, suggesting that it plays a significant role in nucleosome positioning."," Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is  especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions  at both ends of genes. Sequence polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome  positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning. These results reveal  that sequence polymorphisms are under selective constraints to maintain  nucleosome positioning.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no mention of desmins being present in plants. The text only mentions keratins and their assembly into filaments in plants."," Context: and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin  vitro. In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in  diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm  filaments and protofilarnents. The periodic repeat is one of the fundamental  characteristic of all intermediate filaments, and demonstrates the half  staggered arrangement of keratin molecules within the filaments.  ,  Context: A 24-year old man presented himself to the emergency ward with complaints of  fever, nausea, headache, muscle ache and chest pain.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68. These lncRNAs contain consensus Sam68 binding sites."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW is the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of this algorithm is also available.," Context: MOTIVATION: The biological significance of minimal absent words has been  investigated in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. For instance,  three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus  genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all  minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based  on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets.

We present an efficient  method for computing the minimal absent words of bounded length for DNA sequence using a Trie of bounded depth, representing bounded length factors. This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 gene is encoded by an X chromosome locus.," Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and  we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit protein family and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic  binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and Horner's syndrome (specifically congenital HS) are associated with heterochromia iridum.," Context: Waardenburg's syndrome consists of lateral displacement of the inner canthi of  the eyes (dystopia canthorum), a broad nasal root and confluent eyebrows,  heterochromia iridum, a white forelock and congenital deafness. The syndrome is  inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of  the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the  deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered.  Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have no direct effect on fat tissue mentioned in the given information. However, it is mentioned that mice with a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) gene had increased body fat and serum leptin levels, but this"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are  components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.  ,  Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,The rate at which epimutations arise in C. elegans is unknown.," Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a  fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be  transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans.

We analyzed the frequency of duplication of operonic genes in C.  elegans and confirmed that they are duplicated less often in the genome than  monocistronic genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the  plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of  duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of  gene duplication.

The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes.

FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells.
