What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in human diseases. Unlike genetic  mutations, however, they do not change the underlying DNA sequences. Epigenetic  phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with  many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the  methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput  screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a  miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for  methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it  ,  Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in  medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore  indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are  tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic  transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following  treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  ","19270706, 23557020, 23179372, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"There is no explicit mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation in cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: The MTM (myotubularin)/MTMR (myotubularin-related) protein family is comprised  of 15 lipid phosphatases, of which nine members are catalytically active. MTMs  are known to play a fundamental role in human physiology as gene mutations can  give rise to X-linked myotubular myopathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which  manifest in skeletal muscle or in peripheral neurons respectively.  Interestingly, studies have shown MTMR2 and MTMR5, two MTM family members, to be  highly expressed in the testis, particularly in Sertoli and germ cells, and  knockout of either gene resulted in spermatogenic defects. Other studies have  shown that MTMR2 functions in endocytosis and membrane trafficking. In the testis, MTMR2 interacts and co-localizes with c-Src/phospho-Src-(Tyr⁴¹⁶), a  non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that regulates the phosphorylation state of  proteins at the apical ES (ectoplasmic specialization), a unique type of cell junction found between Sertoli cells and elongating/elongated spermatids. In the  present review, we highlight recent findings that have made a significant impact  on our understanding of this protein family in normal cell function and in  ,  Context: arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is  required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg,  and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25,  a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that  zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns  which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions.  Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing  and location of these embryonic cell divisions.  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"For glioblastoma (astrocytoma grade IV), a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7) was found with >10-year latency, indicating an increased risk"," Context: BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they  were first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely  low frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency  technology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has  generated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate the relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of  the head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. This publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study. METHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and  central nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves.  ,  Context: OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.81-2.23, respectively. Regarding acoustic neuroma ipsilateral  mobile phone use in the latency group ≥10 years gave OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.73-4.45.  For ipsilateral cumulative use ≥1640h OR=2.55, 95% CI=1.50-4.40 was obtained.  Also use of cordless phones increased the risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma  in the Hardell group studies. Survival of patients with glioma was analysed in  the Hardell group studies yielding in the >10 years latency period hazard ratio  (HR)=1.2, 95% CI=1.002-1.5 for use of wireless phones. This increased HR was  based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme).  Decreased HR was found for low-grade astrocytoma, WHO grades I-II, which might be caused by RF-EMF exposure leading to tumour-associated symptoms and earlier  detection and surgery with better prognosis. Some studies show increasing  incidence of brain tumours whereas other studies do not. It is concluded that one should be careful using incidence data to dismiss results in analytical  epidemiology.

RESULTS: For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobile and cordless phones)  gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for  astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was  observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to  earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.  ,  Context: The use of cellular telephones has increased dramatically during the 1990's in  the world. In the 1980's the analogue NMT system was used whereas the digital  GSM system was introduced in early 1990's and is now the preferred system. Case  reports of brain tumours in users initiated this case-control study on brain  tumours and use of cellular telephones. Also other exposures were assessed. All  cases, both males and females, with histopathologically verified brain tumour living in Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-96) and Stockholm region (1995-96) aged  20-80 at the time of diagnosis and alive at start of the study were included,  233 in total. Two controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register matched for sex, age and study region. Exposure was assessed  by questionnaires supplemented over the phone.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is organism-independent and can be applied to identify novel architectures in any genome. It has been tested on the fly genome as a case study, but its web-server and standalone versions are available for"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements.

In this method, transcriptional repression by the  'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target  protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not  only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to  isolate tight conditional mutants.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity and clinical utility of functional  assessments (1-minute walk test, 10-meter walk test, Timed Up & Go [TUG] test,  Timed Up and Down Stairs [TUDS] test, sit-to-stand [STS] test, and lateral  step-up [LSU] test).

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression.

Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and  tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of  single-gene tests per sample.  RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical  testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations).  With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1  biomarker for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and  tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers.  Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on  core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2  biomarkers on surgical resection specimens.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies.," Context: multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The  synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies,  (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The  pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system  atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown  cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with  striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of  medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron  ,  Context: It is well known that autonomic failure is severer in patients with dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).  According to the Braak's hypothesis, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory  bulb or peripheral autonomic nervous system. Lewy bodies in the peripheral  autonomic nervous system ascend to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerve, while  those in the olfactory bulb expand to the limbic system. Lewy bodies later  attain the substantia nigra. However, it seems that Braak staging can not  explain difference in severity of autonomic failure between DLB and PD. As a  possibility, in DLB patients with significant autonomic failure, Lewy bodies may have been localized to the peripheral autonomic nervous system in a long time  before onset of dementia or parkinsonism, and propagation of Lewy bodies into  the central nervous system may be initiated by apparition of certain promotion factor, such as ageing and amyloid-β.  ,  Context: Rare, transmissible, and rapidly progressive, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is  an ultimately fatal central nervous system infection caused by accumulation of  abnormally shaped prion proteins in neurons (see Understanding prion proteins).  Although categorized as an infection, CJD doesn't lead to the immune system or  inflammatory response typical of most infectious diseases. This article  discusses the pathophysiology and diagnosis of this terminal illness and nursing  care for patients with suspected or confirmed CJD.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas  as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how  these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by  which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).," Context: characteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different  AHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening. RESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were  diagnosed with SDB. When predicting overall (AHI ≥ 5), moderate-to-severe  (AHI ≥ 15), and severe (AHI ≥ 30) SDB, the sensitivity and specificity of the  NoSAS score were 71.2, 80.4, and 83.1% and 62.4, 49.3, and 40.7%, respectively.  At all AHI cutoffs, the AUC ranged from 0.688 to 0.715 for the NoSAS score and  from 0.663 to 0.693 for the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score had the  largest AUC (0.715, 95% CI: 0.655-0.775) of diagnosing SDB at AHI cutoff of ≥5 events/h. NoSAS performed better in discriminating moderate-to-severe SDB than  STOP-Bang with a marginally significantly higher AUC (0.697 vs. 0.663, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had good performance on the discrimination of SDB patients in sleep clinic and can be utilized as an effective screening tool in  clinical practice.  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: from the existing data of the patients. The NoSAS score was subsequently  calculated based on available data. Predictive parameters for each screening  questionnaires were calculated to compare the discriminative power of those for  high-risk SDB.  RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB.

This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly.

Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of  ,  Context: A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that  h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance  0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until fixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of √(N/s) generations, if N  is the population size. Simulations as well as our results show that genetic  diversity patterns in the recessive case h=0 greatly differ from all other  cases.  ,  Context:  Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has  recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix  quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. The fixation of the beneficial allele  not only affects sequence diversity at single neutral loci but also the joint  allele distribution of several partially linked neutral loci. This distribution can be studied using the ancestral recombination graph for samples of partially  linked neutral loci during the selective sweep. To approximate this graph, we  extend recent work by Etheridge et al. (Ann Appl Probab 16:685-729, 2006) and  ,  Context: pattern that is not compatible with neutrality for this part of the gene. Tests  of neutrality based on comparative genomics suggest that: (1) episodes of  natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human  lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced  diversity downstream of intron 6 and, (2) the target of natural selection may  not be in the SLC2A4 coding sequence.  CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the contrast in the pattern of genetic variation  between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are signatures of the action of  natural selection and thus follow-up studies should investigate the functional importance of different regions of the SLC2A4 gene.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include LC3 and Atg12. Additionally, PI(3)-binding proteins and PI3-phosphatases are also involved in the autophagy process."," Context: Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a dynamic process for degradation of cytosolic  components. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions,  and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system  responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence  factors for blocking autophagy, whereas others utilize some autophagy components  for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase, Atg9-WIPI-1 and  Vps34-beclin1 class III PI3-kinase complexes, and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation  systems. In addition, PI(3)-binding proteins, PI3-phosphatases, and Rab proteins contribute to autophagy. The autophagy process consists of continuous dynamic  membrane formation and fusion. In this review, the relationships between these  Atg complexes and each process are described. Finally, the critical points for  ,  Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is a cell survival  mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays  ,  Context:  Glucocorticoids are fundamental drugs used in the treatment of lymphoid  malignancies with apoptotic cell death as the hitherto proposed mechanism of  action. Recent studies, however, showed that an alternative mode of cell death, autophagy, is involved in the response to anticancer drugs. The specific role of  autophagy and its relationship to apoptosis remains, nevertheless,  controversial: it can either lead to cell survival or can function in cell death. We show that dexamethasone induced autophagy upstream of apoptosis in  acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

However, natural IGs manage to maintain  satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the  problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.  ,  Context: at upstream sites approximately 100 nucleotides from the upstream activating  sequence shared by the two genes. However, TCR initiation sites do not correlate  with either transcription start sites or TATA boxes. Rad16-mediated GGR tightly  correlates with nucleosome positioning when the genes are repressed and are slow  in the nucleosome core and fast in linker DNA. Induction of transcription  enhanced GGR in nucleosome core DNA, especially in the nucleosomes around and  upstream of the transcription start sites. Furthermore, when the genes were  induced, GGR was slower in the transcribed regions than in the upstream regions.  Finally, simultaneous deletion of RAD16, RAD26, and RPB9 resulted in no detectable repair in all sites along the region analyzed. Our results suggest  that (a). TCR may be initiated by a transcription activator, presumably through  the loading of RNA polymerase II, rather than by transcription initiation or elongation per se; (b). TCR and nucleosome disruption-enhanced GGR are the major  causes of rapid repair in regions around and upstream of transcription start  sites; (c). transcription machinery may hinder access of NER factors to a DNA  ","19160492, 20170405, 22732409, 14734564",Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor results from repeated episodes of bleeding into bone, subperiosteum, and soft tissue. It can mimic true tumors such as chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, and synovial sarcoma,"," Context:  Prevention is essential for avoiding the complications of muscle hematomas  (pseudotumors, compartment syndromes and peripheral nerve lesions) in hemophilic  patients. This is achieved through early diagnosis of muscle hematomas and proper long-term hematological treatment until they have resolved (confirmed by  image studies). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage could be beneficial in  terms of achieving better and faster symptom relief. When suspecting a hemophilic pseudotumor, biopsy will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out  true tumors (chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) that sometimes mimic  hemophilic pseudotumor. Surgical removal of hemophilic pseudotumor is the best  ,  Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ,  Context: AIM: Hemophilic pseudotumors result from repeated episodes of bleeding into  bone, subperiosteum, and soft tissue. Since clotting factors became available,  uncontrolled perioperative bleeding is a less significant problem for surgeons  in developed countries. However, they are more difficult to come by in China.  Additionally, patients often have to undergo surgery for giant masses and suffer  complications. We wanted to present our experience in the surgical management of hemophilic pseudotumors over a 40-year period. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 429 hemorrhagic coagulopathy patients  between 1983 and 2015. Diagnosis of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed following clinical, radiological, and pathological criteria. The data were  recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor,  etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical  ,  Context: INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum.  CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature.

Which eye condition is managed by the athens protocol?,Cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring.," Context: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial  topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling,  combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for  the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both  corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45  years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity  (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the  right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the  recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We  decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February  2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was  designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform.  ,  Context: thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm).  It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm  (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C. The mean topographic thickness variability in  Group A at 1 year was 4.64 ± 1.63 μm (range 1.6 to 8.1 μm) (P<.05). It was 5.77  ± 3.39 μm (range 1.3 to 17.8 μm) in Group B and 1.59 ± 0.79 μm (range 0.6 to 5.6  μm) in Group C. CONCLUSION: Anterior segment OCT indicated a thinner and more homogeneous  remodeled epithelium in the keratoconic eyes treated using the Athens protocol.

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one keratoconic cases subjected to the Athens  Protocol procedure were studied for visual acuity, keratometry, pachymetry, and anterior surface irregularity indices up to 3 years postoperatively by  Scheimpflug imaging (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). RESULTS: Mean visual acuity changes at 3 years postoperatively were +0.38 ± 0.31 (range: -0.34 to +1.10) for uncorrected distance visual acuity and +0.20 ± 0.21  (range: -0.32 to +0.90) for corrected distance visual acuity. Mean K1 (flat  meridian) keratometric values were 46.56 ± 3.83 diopters (D) (range: 39.75 to  ,  Context: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults.  UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous  melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence  in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors  include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular  melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases.  Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy,  phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination. Ocular outcomes are best with small tumours not extending close to the optic  disc and/or fovea.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. Additionally, mTORC1 mediates IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells"," Context: signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either  metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling  pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance. We conclude that the  upregulation of Notch1 expression by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is an  essential event in the development of hepatic insulin resistance in the presence  of excess amino acids. Activation of AMPK prevents amino acid-induced insulin  resistance through the suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling pathway.  ,  Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling  critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A  ","24302004, 26026060, 23641065, 24931163","mTORC1 was found to regulate STAT3 activity in, at least, three ways: 1) after induction by IL6, 2) by direct phosphorylation during hypoxia, to promote HIF-1α mRNA transcription, and 3) after activation by excess amino acids, which then positively regulate Notch1 expression through STAT3 activation.","22055460, 23641065, 26026060, 24302004, 24931163"
List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads showed that mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), with more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3'"," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: to the identification of putative clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of this  gene family. By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.  ,  Context: Methylation of histone tails plays a pivotal role in the regulation of a wide  range of biological processes. SET and MYND domain-containing protein (SMYD) is  a methyltransferase, five family members of which have been identified in  humans. SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, and SMYD4 have been found to play critical roles in  carcinogenesis and/or the development of heart and skeletal muscle. However, the  physiological functions of SMYD5 remain unknown. To investigate the function of Smyd5 in vivo, zebrafish were utilised as a model system. We first examined  smyd5 expression patterns in developing zebrafish embryos. Smyd5 transcripts  were abundantly expressed at early developmental stages and then gradually decreased. Smyd5 was expressed in all adult tissues examined. Loss-of-function  analysis of Smyd5 was then performed in zebrafish embryos using smyd5 morpholino  oligonucleotide (MO). Embryos injected with smyd5-MO showed normal gross  ","22722342, 10929203, 18231586, 27377701",Yes. There is extensive alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development.,22722342

Specifically, mutations such as T118M and c.68C>G leading to a T23R missense mutation have been detected."," Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Most cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease are caused by  mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), including  heterozygous duplications (CMT1A), deletions (HNPP), and point mutations  (CMT1E).  METHODS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to study PMP22  mutations based on the results of multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length  polymorphism methods in 77 Chinese Han families with CMT1. PMP22 sequencing was  performed in MLPA-negative probands. Clinical characteristics were collected for  all CMT1A/HNPP probands and their family members. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 77 CMT1 probands (27.3%) carried duplication/deletion  (dup/del) copynumber variants. No point mutations were detected. SNP array and  MLPA seem to have similar sensitivity. Fifty-seven patients from 19 CMT1A families had the classical CMT phenotype, except for 1 with concomitant CIDP.  Two HNPP probands presented with acute ulnar nerve palsy or recurrent sural  nerve palsy, respectively.  ,  Context: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with deafness is a clinically distinct entity and is  associated with mutations or deletions in several genes including PMP22 gene.  Here, we report a large family showing characteristic phenotypes of  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A along with deafness in an autosomal dominant  fashion. We detected a sequence variation (c.68C>G) co-segregating with the  disease phenotype and leading to a T23R missense mutation in PMP22.  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6.

The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: usually has only a weak effect.

Quantitative reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels  of circRNAs in the prostate cancer tissue, nonmalignant tissue, LNCaP-miR-145  cells, and LNCaP-NC cells. The interaction of miRNA and circRNA was further  confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. A total of 267 and 149 circRNAs  were significantly up- and downregulated in LNCaP-miR-145 cells, respectively.  hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_101996 and hsa_circRNA_09142 were the 3 circRNAs  that interacted with hsa-miR-145-5p; hsa_circRNA_008068 and hsa_circRNA_406557 were the 2 circRNAs that interacted with hsa-miR-145-3p.

Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs  in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular  RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being  associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with  individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We  carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding  genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by  their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are  known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes.  Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the  understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which  confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA  (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of single-stranded RNA molecules that  normally do not encode proteins. circRNAs are involved in many physiological  processes as well as the pathogenesis of diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a pathological force in advanced heart diseases. A  growing number of studies have reported that the occurrence and development of  cardiac fibrosis is closely associated with the regulation of circRNAs. This review summarizes the current understanding of circRNA biogenesis and function  and will highlight the recent updates regarding the involvement of circRNAs in  cardiac fibrosis, and their potential as emerging biomarkers and therapeutic  targets.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is used at Hamburg, Germany, and Stanford, CA, USA, specifically at facilities such as Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and XFEL."," Context: industrial property milestone-documents and their overall numeral trends are  presented. In 1971, J. Madey invented and developed the Free Electron LASER  (FEL), a vacuum-tube that uses a beam of relativistic electrons passing through  a periodic, transverse magnetic field (wiggler) to produce coherent radiation,  contained in an optical cavity defined by mirrors. A resonance condition that  involves the energy of the electron beam, the strength of the magnetic field,  and the periodicity of the magnet determines the wavelength of the radiation.  The FEL Coherent Light Sources like the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at  Stanford, CA, USA or the Xray Free Electron LASER (XFEL) at Hamburg, Germany, will work much like a high-speed (< 100 femtoseconds) camera, enabling  scientists to take stop-motion pictures, on the nanoscale, of atoms and  molecules in motion. The curve of FEL-related patents of the last 20 years is much smoother than the corresponding one for in vitro Diagnostics conventional  LASERS. If the diodes brought a LASER into almost everyone's pocket, the  above-mentioned super-imaging systems are huge facilities of enormous cost--the  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context: the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms. The present method offers a potential for ab initio structural  determination in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography.  ,  Context: We determined the pulse duration of x-ray free electron laser light at 10 keV  using highly resolved single-shot spectra, combined with an x-ray free electron  laser simulation. Spectral profiles, which were measured with a spectrometer  composed of an ultraprecisely figured elliptical mirror and an analyzer flat  crystal of silicon (555), changed markedly when we varied the compression  strength of the electron bunch. The analysis showed that the pulse durations were reduced from 31 to 4.5 fs for the strongest compression condition. The  method, which is readily applicable to evaluate shorter pulse durations,  provides a firm basis for the development of femtosecond to attosecond sciences  in the x-ray region.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain, involving forebrain and facial malformations that can range from mild to severe."," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: Parallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to  TRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting  proliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is  overexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by  PE. This response seems to be an ERK kinase dependent process. Over-expression  of TRalpha1 may lead to fetal cardiac phenotype in the absence of thyroid  hormone availability. Furthermore, TRalpha1 seems to be critical in cardiac  myoblast differentiation.  ","11731613, 23926648, 15831522, 18622044","ARB1, ARB2, TAK1, p38, TRalpha1","18031713, 15831522, 11731613"

It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune  features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly  understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized  SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with  MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell  activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had  SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C  patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that  correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained  immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time,  concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures  that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation  and trajectory of MIS-C.  ,  Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19,  initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There  is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a  rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease  ,  Context: Several studies demonstrated that COVID-19 in children is a relatively mild  disease. However, recently a more serious condition characterized by systemic  inflammation with clinical or microbiological evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2  has been described. This syndrome is now known as either ""Pediatric Inflammatory  Multisystem Syndrome temporally related with COVID-19"" (PIMS-TS) (1), or  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) (2) and is currently considered a rare post-COVID-19 complication which, in a minority of cases, can  lead to death.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context: Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an  anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug  functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus,  rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of  favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of  ,  Context: Filoviruses are zoonotic and among the deadliest viruses known to mankind, with  mortality rates in outbreaks reaching up to 90%. Despite numerous efforts to  identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between  the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an  increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology. The high mortality  rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat. This  article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic  potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment of future outbreaks, which would help prevent the evolution of filovirus into  more virulent and more transmissible viruses.  ,  Context: The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set  of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show  the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and facilitate G-quadruplex multimerization. Thus, the ICD signatures can be used to  determine whether specific unknown sequences can form G-quadruplex motifs. The  viral sequences were analyzed using standard spectral and electrophoretic methods. In addition, the ability to target G-quadruplexes located in  filoviruses offers researchers attractive therapeutic targets which would be of  particular use in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This article is  ,  Context:  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.  In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza appeared nearly simultaneously around the globe  and caused extraordinary mortality (an estimated 50-100 million deaths) associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The  descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they  cause significant mortality each year.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets IL-1α and IL-1β cytokine receptors.," Context:  BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 has been implicated as a mediator of recurrent  pericarditis. The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and  interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, event-driven,  randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with acute symptoms of recurrent pericarditis (as assessed on a patient-reported scale) and systemic  inflammation (as shown by an elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level). Patients  presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were  ,  Context: of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta,  initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/  Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in  CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of  these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by  cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer  half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not  tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The initial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS  suggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet  to be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other chronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and  systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  ,  Context: developed, most of them indicated in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but  also psoriatic arthritis. Most currently available molecules target TNF-alfa  with different strategies (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab,  and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 (tocilizumab), CTLA-4 (abatacept), and B cells  (rituximab, belimumab) as they are key mediators in the cascade of inflammation.  Further, small molecules have been recently developed to target intracellular  signaling, such as Janus Kinases for tofacitinib, the first FDA-approved small  molecule for rheumatoid arthritis. Most novel treatments are being developed for  arthritis with specific differences between rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, as well as for systemic lupus erythematosus, following the approval of  belimumab. Finally, biologic therapies are effective also in gout, mainly  targeting interleukin-1 to block the inflammasome. This review article describes the new and upcoming treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic  arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and gout to dissect what we should be  aware of when discussing these new and promising molecules.  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).," Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex  ,  Context: Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in  MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules.  Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of  HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in  the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that  the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to  microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased  binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule  stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule  dynamics under certain conditions.  ,  Context: Angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cell migration, which was  blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. It has been reported  that angiotensin II is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by  mechanical stretch in endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that endothelial  cells subjected to a 10% uniaxial stretch showed vertical alignment to the  direction of tension and tubulin deacetylation in the peripheral side of cells,  in comparison with control static cells. The mechanical stretch-induced changes  of microtubules were blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion.  Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that acetylated tubulin was decreased in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in the intima of  the aortic walls in mice loaded with angiotensin II, in comparison with mice  loaded with control vehicle. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in  endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced  vascular remodeling.  ,  Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  ","12024216, 23798680, 21677656, 26227334","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation.","22972992, 17868033, 20520769, 22700584, 23126280, 17574768, 23798680, 22046262, 21677656, 18697214"

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have potential for antitumor activity, but they also have tumor-promoting activities. Targeting TAMs has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, suggesting that they can be a valuable target for anticancer therapy. However, their role"," Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting  strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context:  Macrophages are one of the principal host cell populations in solid tumors. They  are capable, due to their plasticity, of acquiring phenotypes that either combat  (M1 type) or promote (M2 type) neoplastic growth. These cells, known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play complex but pivotal roles in the  outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignant lesions. Among the various  parenchymal and stromal cell populations found in tumors, TAMs have been shown to have the greatest capacity for the uptake of systemically administered  photosensitizers. Both the tumor-localizing property of photosensitizers and  their tumor-localized fluorescence could be partly attributed to the activity of  ","29594035, 32445205, 34276698, 25620672",Therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional therapies has yielded promising results.,29594035
Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi-1B is important for hematopoiesis as its expression is highly restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human"," Context: In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1  and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an erythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote  erythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts.  Erythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context:  To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B),  a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and  differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the naturally Gfi-1B overexpressing cell line K562 was cultured in the presence of Gfi-1B  target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). SiRNA treatment significantly  knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not  cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down  Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon  ,  Context:  Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic  progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors  through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main  downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification  of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility is measured through the NOMe-seq methodology.," Context: chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can  precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development and  progression of periodontal disease. Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies. We have developed a system for efficient  transposon mutagenesis of P. gingivalis using a modified mariner transposon.  Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome  junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using  Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the  library was produced. Identification of fitness of individual mutants under  specific conditions can be performed by exposing the library to selective  pressures.  ,  Context: The study of epigenetic properties of the human genome, including structural  modifications of DNA and chromatin, has increased tremendously as mounting  evidence has demonstrated how much epigenetics affects human gene expression.  Buenrostro et al. have developed a rapid method, requiring low numbers of living  cells as input, for examining chromatin accessibility across the epigenome,  known as the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing  (ATAC-seq). The overall goal of this unit is to provide a thorough ATAC-seq data  analysis plan, as well as describe how primary human blood samples can be  processed for use in ATAC-seq. In addition, a number of quality control parameters are discussed to ensure the integrity and confidence in the ATAC-seq  data. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  ,  Context: Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) technology has also been developed to study  cell type-specific chromatin accessibility in tissue samples containing a  heterogeneous cellular population. However, due to the intrinsic nature of  scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of  biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult.  To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and  software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there  is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this  review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from preprocessing to downstream analysis, along with an up-to-date list of published  studies that involved the application of this method. We expect this review will  provide a guideline for successful data generation and analysis methods using appropriate software tools and databases for the study of chromatin  accessibility at single-cell resolution.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"The Digit Ratio (2D:4D) has been found to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D ratios than controls, and there was a negative correlation between 2"," Context:  BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels. METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21).  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) was approved on August 1, 2017, and Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) was approved on July 20, 2018."," Context: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH  mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal  accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.  Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by  Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory  (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively.

The phenotypic expression can vary  considerably within the same family. The LV noncompaction can rarely occur as a  transient phenomenon during myocarditis. We present the case of a 23-year-old  patient, admitted to our Department for cardiac evaluation because of ECG  changes and cardiac enlargement revealed at thoracic radiography. She had a  history of chronic toxoplasmosis. An echocardiography was performed revealing  left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,  diffuse hypokinesia and signs of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Under  these circumstances, we have considered the presence of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. A cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed  and it sustained the diagnosis. The alternative cause of isolated left  ventricular noncompaction (prominent trabeculation due to myocardial toxoplasmosis) was considered improbable.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder caused by the  arrest of myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, leading to a non compacted  endocardial layer with marked hypertrabeculation and deep recesses.  AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of  15 adult patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 ± 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and  July 2010. RESULTS: The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope  in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 ± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 ±  10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved  in all the cases.

METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is a recently described  form of cardiomyopathy that is associated with a significant risk of  life-threatening arrhythmia and thromboembolic complications.

CONCLUSION: Advances in diagnostic imaging have undoubtedly led to an increase  in the detection of isolated left ventricular non-compaction. Diagnosing and  differentiating this uncommon condition from other forms of cardiomyopathy are important as treatment and prognosis may differ significantly.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ," Context: immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are  presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize work on the expression and purification of the full-length protein, and then  focus on the design, expression, and purification of an active C-terminal  polymerase fragment. The generation of this active construct was nontrivial and time consuming. Almost all published biochemical work to date has been performed  with this domain fragment. Strategies to obtain and improve crystals of a  ternary pol θ complex (enzyme:DNA:nucleotide) are also presented, along with key  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing DDK function. This is achieved through PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires phosphorylation of the MCM  complex by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), composed of Cdc7 kinase and its  activator, Dbf4. We report here that budding yeast Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor  1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context:  Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization.

DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism.

The DEAH  helicase DHX37 (Dhr1 in yeast) is activated by the ribosome biogenesis factor  UTP14A to facilitate maturation of the small ribosomal subunit. We report the  crystal structure of DHX37 in complex with single-stranded RNA, revealing a  canonical DEAH ATPase/helicase architecture complemented by a structurally unique carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Structural comparisons of the  nucleotide-free DHX37-RNA complex with DEAH helicases bound to RNA and ATP  analogs reveal conformational changes resulting in a register shift in the bound RNA, suggesting a mechanism for ATP-dependent 3'-5' RNA translocation. We  further show that a conserved sequence motif in UTP14A interacts with and  activates DHX37 by stimulating its ATPase activity and enhancing RNA binding.

Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures.

To address this lack of a gold-standard  dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and  iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that  can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we  also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak  calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and  also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are  measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the  handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is  particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies  in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which  transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the  design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and  whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs  abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can  also simulate RNA-Seq data.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It participates in the Notch signalling pathway as one of the neurogenic genes."," Context: Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences  results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling  pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho family members is correlated with several neoplastic conditions. Here we focus  on the functions of Groucho proteins during body patterning and their  implication in tumorigenesis.  ,  Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for  studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms.  This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,  allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant  developing context. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with  the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC  partnership as an illustrative test case. This protocol applies to any  transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general.  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression.

Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic  hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors induce hyponatremia (due to aldosterone  resistance), hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Other drugs such as  immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia.  ,  Context: Fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF23)is a phosphaturic hormone, and its excess  causes several kinds of congenital and acquired hypophosphatemic diseases. A  combination of oral active vitamin D3 and phosphate salt is the current standard  therapy for patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets and  osteomalacia. However, these medications may cause long-term complications, such  as secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, an  anti-FGF23 neutralizing antibody that blocks FGF23 activity has been produced.  X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets(XLHR)is the most prevalent form of hereditary  FGF23-related hypophosphatemia. The safety and efficacy of a human anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23 or burosumab, has been confirmed in adults and children with  XLHR.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is critical for maintaining genomic integrity of late replicating domains, but it does not impact origin activation throughout the genome."," Context: approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: for lysines 5 and 12) and at H3 lysine 18. The last was not observed in other  plants. Strong methylation at H3 lysine 4 was restricted to euchromatin, while  strong methylation at H3 lysine 9 occurred preferentially in heterochromatic  chromocenters of Arabidopsis nuclei. Chromocenter appearance, DNA methylation  and histone modification patterns were similar in nuclei of wild-type and  kryptonite mutant (which lacks H3 lysine 9-specific histone methyltransferase),  except that methylation at H3 lysine 9 in heterochromatic chromocenters was  reduced to the same low level as in euchromatin. Thus, a high level of  H3methylK9 is apparently not necessary to maintain chromocenter structure and does not prevent methylation of H3 lysine 4 within Arabidopsis chromocenters.  ,  Context: environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: The delivery of site-specific post-translational modifications to histones  generates an epigenetic regulatory network that directs fundamental DNA-mediated  processes and governs key stages in development. Methylation of histone H4  lysine-20 has been implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional silencing, genomic  stability and regulation of replication. We present the structure of the histone  H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide  substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals  that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain  configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and  Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously  mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product. We therefore predict that other enzymes are responsible for the  tri-methylation of histone H4K20 that marks silenced heterochromatin.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,"CLCNKB gene, specifically an identical missense mutation substituting a threonine for an alanine at codon 204 (A204T)."," Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds. The parents and siblings of each patient, as well as a population of 300 healthy control adult subjects, were also analyzed. All ten patients were  found to be homozygous for an identical missense mutation in the CLCNKB gene,  substituting a threonine for an alanine at codon 204 (A204T) in the putative  ,  Context: evaluated 14 Barth syndrome pedigrees for mutations in G4.5 and have identified  unique mutations in all, including four splice-site mutations, three deletions,  one insertion, five missense mutations, and one nonsense mutation. Nine of the  14 mutations are predicted to significantly disrupt the protein products of  G4.5. The occurrence of missense mutations in exons 3 and 8 suggests that these  exons encode essential portions of the G4. 5 proteins, whose functions remain  unknown. We found no correlation between the location or type of mutation and  any of the clinical or laboratory abnormalities of Barth syndrome, which  suggests that additional factors modify the expression of the Barth phenotype. The characterization of mutations of the G4.5 gene will be useful for carrier  detection, genetic counseling, and the identification of patients with Barth  syndrome who do not manifest all of the cardinal features of this disorder.  ,  Context: of alpha gene expression has been observed, which is not accompanied by  structural alterations of the coding or controlling regions of the alpha gene  complex. Most probably the acquired alpha-thalassaemia is due to the lack of  soluble activators (or presence of repressors) which act in trans and affect the  expression of the homologous clusters and are coded by genes not (closely)  linked to the alpha genes. The ATR-X syndrome results from mutations of the XH2  gene, located on the X chromosome (Xq13.3) and coding for a transacting factor  which regulates gene expression. The interaction of the different  alpha-thalassaemia determinants results in three phenotypes: the alpha-thalassaemic trait, clinically silent and presenting only limited  alterations of haematological parameters, HbH disease, characterized by the  development of a haemolytic anaemia of variable degree, and the (lethal) Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome. The diagnosis of alpha-thalassaemia due to  deletions is implemented by the electrophoretic analysis of genomic DNA digested  with restriction enzymes and hybridized with specific molecular probes.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play"," Context: RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded  by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many  eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral  protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: target of the Drosophila adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (dADAR). This is the  first case for any organism where a nAChR gene is the target of mRNA editing.  Seven adenosines could be modified in the extracellular ligand-binding region of  Dalpha6, four of which are also edited in the Dalpha6 ortholog in the tobacco  budworm Heliothis virescens. The conservation of an editing site between the  insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera makes nAChR editing the most  evolutionarily conserved invertebrate RNA editing site so far described. These  findings add to our understanding of nAChR subunit diversity, which is increased  and regulated by mechanisms acting at the genomic and mRNA levels.  ,  Context:  The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Avandamet is a single-tablet combination of metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: At present, China has listed the compound tablet containing a fixed  dose of rosiglitazone and metformin, Avandamet, which may improve patient  compliance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  Avandamet or uptitrated metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes  inadequately controlled with metformin alone. METHODS: This study was a 48-week, multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, active-controlled trial. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated  hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5%) receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg)  were recruited from 21 centers in China (from 19 November, 2009 to 15 March, 2011). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients who  reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% between Avandamet and metformin treatment. RESULTS: At week 48, 83.33% of patients reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% in  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.

References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by employing a mechanism of action distinct from antisense and RNA interference. Bifunctional oligonucleotides called U1 Adaptors can be designed with a 'target domain' complementary to," Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition,  causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. In the present study we show  that deletion of mouse U6 gene sequences upstream of nucleotide position -217,  including the octanucleotide motif, reduces U6 transcription by 90% when assayed  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen was approved in the EU in May 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).," Context: Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial  chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the  multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult  patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in  whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  ,  Context: risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased  risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available  therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG  lowering. EXPERT OPINION: Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower  plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both  apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important  regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents  targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3  inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up  to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the  treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.  ,  Context: Volanesorsen (previously known as ISIS 304801) is a 20-nucleotide partially  2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2'-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmer,  which was recently approved in the European Union as a novel, first-in-class  treatment in the reduction of triglyceride levels in patients with familial  chylomicronemia syndrome. We characterized the absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion characteristics of volanesorsen in mice, rats,  monkeys, and humans, in either radiolabeled or nonradiolabeled studies. This  also included the characterization of all of the observed ASO metabolite species  excreted in urine. Volanesorsen is highly bound to plasma proteins that are similar in mice, monkeys, and humans. In all species, plasma concentrations  declined in a multiphasic fashion, characterized by a relatively fast initial  distribution phase and then a much slower terminal elimination phase following subcutaneous bolus administration.

GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently  undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory  prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides. However,  ","10545285, 18975117, 21060250, 20438784","The human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are two of the most frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers","20438784, 10545285, 25554218, 18975117, 21060250, 22828605"
Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context:  We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  ,  Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in  species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: signs include severe constipation and distended bowel due to a non-motile colon.  If left untreated, aganglionic megacolon is lethal. This severe congenital  condition is caused by the absence of colonic neural ganglia and thus lack of  intrinsic innervation of the colon due in turn to improper colonization of the  developing intestines by ENS progenitor cells. These progenitor cells are  derived from a transient stem cell population called neural crest cells (NCC).  The genetics of HSCR is complex and can involve mutations in multiple genes.  However, it is estimated that mutations in known genes account for less than  half of the cases of HSCR observed clinically. The male sex bias is currently unexplained. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the  pathophysiology and genetics of HSCR, within the context of our current  knowledge of NCC development, sex chromosome genetics and laboratory models.

The net effect, v/(u + v), has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure.

We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as  a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and  clathrin-mediated endocytosis function.

Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6.

In addition, some mutations in GJB1, MPZ  and GDAP1 also present with clinical and electrophysiologic findings of CMT2.  Mutation of NEFL or KIF1B cause dominantly inherited axonal neuropathies,  whereas mutation of GJB1 or MPZ can present as genocopies of dominant axonal  neuropathies. In addition to the above diseases, we have reported a new type of NMSNP(MIM # *604484) characterized by proximal dominant neurogenic atrophy,  obvious sensory nerve involvement and the gene locus on 3q13.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: The ambiguous terminology 'Iodine Prophylaxis' used for decades to provide  iodine to the population for very different purposes as well as its replacement  with 'Iodine Thyroid Blocking' is discussed and argued. Recommendations of  international organisations regarding the action level for Iodine Thyroid  Blocking and their implementation in national regulations in a few Member States  of the European Union, and particularly in Hungary, is presented and discussed.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides. Iodine prophylaxis can be a relevant countermeasure  in Norway and will be implemented according to recommendations from the Crisis  Committee for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid.

How to proceed in case of repeated  release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again  recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine  thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed  systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can  be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is  negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be  considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the  replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake  is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine  release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up  ,  Context:  Current recommendations for calcium intake call for 1,000 mg per day for women  ages 19-50 and 1,200 mg per day for women over age 50 to ensure bone health.  Given recent concerns that calcium supplements may raise risk for cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, women should aim to meet this recommendation  primarily by eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calcium supplements only if  needed to reach the RDA goal (often only approximately 500 mg per day in  supplements is required).

These intriguing results raise important questions about  the nature of recombination, and highlight practical issues of marker collection, the influence of statistical modelling on apparent block structure,  and the levels of genotyping necessary for studies of common diseases. Knowledge  of local disequilibrium patterns may help identify common polymorphisms involved  ,  Context: Inadvertent handling of the diagnostic procedures in laboratories lacking in  knowledge, experience and technical competence is repeatedly the reason for  harmful underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Gene diagnosis of the carrier  condition, principally within reach in all types of acute porphyria, is of  incomparable versatility and accuracy. However, despite recent great  achievements in the molecular biology of porphyric disease, genomic procedures  cannot replace biochemical methods in monitoring the activity and progress of  the disease, or the effects of therapy. The classical methods are also useful  when it comes to screening for the associated disease states. In these tasks, professional handling of the methods and skillful interpretation of the results  are of paramount importance. Knowledge of the limitations and pitfalls of the  procedures is a guard against maldiagnosis, which may be fatal.

Cells  harboring the MAC1(up1) allele fail to attenuate FRE1 and CTR1 expression in a  Cu-dependent manner. Additional MAC1(up) alleles exist within the first of two  cysteine-rich sequence motifs adjacent to the His --> Gln MAC1(up1) encoded  substitution. Thus, Cu-regulation of Mac1p function arises from a novel  Cu-specific repression of the transactivation domain function.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1.

We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations  ,  Context: In this work we analyze splicing mutations identified in propionic acidemia  patients to clarify their functional effects and their involvement in the  disease phenotype. Two mutations in the PCCA gene detected in homozygous  patients and involving consensus splice sequences (IVS21+3del4 and IVS22-2A>G)  were shown to produce some normal splicing in patients' cells, at very low  levels, which were quantitated by real-time PCR methods, and which presumably  are sufficient to moderate the phenotype. We have also analysed the effect of  mutations c.653A>G and IVS10-11del6 in the PCCB gene present in heterozygous  patients with mild phenotype. The c.653A>G mutation is located in the last codon of exon 6 and interferes with the correct spliceosomal assembly activating a  cryptic splice site within exon 6, which leads to an in-frame six-nucleotide  deletion (delV217-K218). Minigene analysis and sequence-specific hybridization probes using real-time PCR methods showed that no normally spliced transcript is  detectable in the patients' fibroblasts.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"Med220 and Med70 are two subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. Additionally, the complex contains multiple other subunits, but their specific names are not mentioned in the provided context information."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context:  Cristae junctions mark the boundaries of respiratory compartments in the inner  mitochondrial membrane.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is mentioned in the text where it is stated that ""Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes, archae"," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1.

In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: conserved motifs/domains, functional prediction, and protein-protein  interactions to enhance the confidence of prediction. As a result, we were able  to confidently predict 98 putative OMPs from the avian strain genome and 107  OMPs from the porcine strain genome with 83% overlap between the two genomes. CONCLUSIONS: The bioinformatic framework developed in this study has increased  the number of putative OMPs identified in P. multocida and allowed these OMPs to  be identified with a higher degree of confidence.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for the cellular stress response and regulates stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK activity is linked to SG formation, as pharmacological kinase inhibition interferes with SG formation."," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: Previously, we found that treatment of cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor  geldanamycin (GA) leads to a substantial reduction in the number of processing  bodies (P-bodies), and also alters the size and subcellular localization of  stress granules. These findings imply that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is  involved in the formation of P-bodies and stress granules. To verify these  observations, we examined whether another Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (RA) affected P-bodies and stress granules. Treatment with RA reduced the level of  the Hsp90 client protein Argonaute 2 and the number of P-bodies. Although stress  granules still assembled in RA-treated cells upon heat shock, they were smaller and more dispersed in the cytoplasm than those in untreated cells. Furthermore  eIF4E and eIF4E-transporter were dissociated selectively from stress granules in  RA-treated cells.

Unexpectedly, deletion of several stress  granule and processing body genes, including pbp1Δ, were found to be synthetic  lethal with pfy1Δ. Mutations in ATXN2, the human ortholog of PBP1, are a known  ALS genetic risk factor and ataxin 2 is a stress granule component in mammalian  cells. Given this genetic interaction and recent evidence linking stress granule  dynamics to ALS pathogenesis, we hypothesized that profilin 1 might also  associate with stress granules. Here we report that profilin 1 and related  protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary  cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the  potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis.  ,  Context: The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of  ","25840010, 21439943, 24920614, 25437551",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is a poly(A) polymerase involved in the regulation of mRNA expression, specifically in controlling the 3'-end formation of select mRNAs, including those encoding cytoprotective enzymes like haem oxygenase-1"," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: function. We identified air1-C178R and air2-C167R alleles encoding air1/2 mutant  proteins with a substitution in the second cysteine of ZnK5. Mutagenesis of the  second cysteine in AIR1/2 ZnK1-5 reveals that Air1/2 ZnK4 and -5 are critical  for Air protein function in vivo. In addition, we find that the level of CUT,  NEL025c, in air1 ZnK1-5 mutants is stabilized, particularly in air1 ZnK4,  suggesting a role for Air1 ZnK4 in the degradation of CUTs. We also find that  Air1/2 ZnK4 and -5 are critical for Trf4 interaction and that the Air1-Trf4  interaction and Air1 level are critical for TRAMP complex integrity. We identify  a conserved IWRXY motif in the Air1 ZnK4-5 linker that is important for Trf4 interaction. We also find that hZCCHC7, a putative human orthologue of Air1 that  contains the IWRXY motif, localizes to the nucleolus in human cells and  interacts with both mammalian Trf4 orthologues, PAPD5 and PAPD7 (PAP-associated domain containing 5 and 7), suggesting that hZCCHC7 is the Air component of a  human TRAMP complex.  ,  Context: PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and  temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P2 required for the regulation of specific  signalling pathways. Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P2 we  set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha.  Here we show that PIPKIalpha co-localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with  a newly identified non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which we have termed  Star-PAP (nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIalpha regulated-poly(A) polymerase) and  that the activity of Star-PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P2.  Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha function together in a complex to control the expression of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme  haem oxygenase-1 (refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by  regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data demonstrate a model by which phosphoinositide signalling works in tandem with  complement pathways to regulate the activity of Star-PAP and the subsequent  biosynthesis of its target mRNA. The results reveal a mechanism for the  ,  Context: mechanism of control of these interactions are not defined. We identified a  phosphorylated residue (serine 6, S6) on Star-PAP in the zinc finger region, the  domain required for PIPKIα interaction. We show that S6 is phosphorylated by  CKIα within the nucleus which is required for Star-PAP nuclear retention and  interaction with PIPKIα. Unlike the CKIα mediated phosphorylation at the  catalytic domain, Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation is insensitive to oxidative stress  suggesting a signal mediated regulation of CKIα activity. S6 phosphorylation  together with coactivator PIPKIα controlled select subset of Star-PAP target  messages by regulating Star-PAP-mRNA association. Our results establish a novel role for phosphorylation in determining Star-PAP target mRNA specificity and  regulation of 3'-end processing.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function causes defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.," Context: addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  and the prominent roles of Ihh in coordinating skeletogenesis, genetic ablation  of Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired  Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast  differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures. Our data  demonstrate that Scube2 plays a key regulatory role in Ihh-dependent  endochondral bone formation.  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is  characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by  progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with  degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and  neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including  involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer,  which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the  disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ","25639508, 34565721, 32346735, 19625506",Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.,25639508
What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express FRα. It targets diseased tissue by attaching a radioactive," Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis. There are still  concerns about the long term safety of TNF antagonists in the pediatric age  group and unanswered questions about increased risks of malignancy and  ,  Context: RESULTS: Our index patient had a neurologic illness defined initially by ataxia  and dysarthria, which fluctuated in relation to each subsequent infliximab  infusion and, after 6 months, culminated in areflexic flaccid quadriplegia. In  addition, 15 patients in whom Guillain-Barré syndrome developed following  TNFalpha antagonist therapy were identified from the FDA database.  Guillain-Barré syndrome developed following infliximab therapy in 9 patients,  following etanercept therapy in 5 patients, and following adalimumab therapy in  1 patient. Among the 13 patients for whom followup data were available, 1  patient experienced no resolution, 9 patients had partial resolution, and 3 patients had complete resolution of Guillain-Barré syndrome following therapy. CONCLUSION: An association of Guillain-Barré syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist  therapy is supported by the worsening of neurologic symptoms that occurred in our index patient following each infusion of infliximab, and by the temporal  association of this syndrome with TNFalpha antagonist therapy in 15 other  patients.

We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of  childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single  universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard  cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of  selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA.  Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater  than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for  inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology,  tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the  ,  Context:  Brain tumors are one of the most common childhood malignancies. Diffuse  high-grade gliomas represent approximately 10% of pediatric brain tumors. Exon  sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be  seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse  high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. We performed a pyrosequencing-based analysis for the identification of H3F3A codon  27 and codon 34 mutations in 338 pediatric brain tumors.

CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in paediatric patients ≥3 years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an  enzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes progressive dementia in children. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of  intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was  initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received  the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a  ,  Context: was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4 weeks (range 0.1-129 weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: Italian urologists with the use of PDE5 inhibitors in the clinical practice.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been tested for the construction of the SSC (submandibular gland) in rats. Additionally, the feasibility of 3D printing technology has also been demonstrated for complex 3D organs, but no specific organ is mentioned."," Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically  ,  Context: few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for  printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the  feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the  rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is  useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals  avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the  surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and  can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth,  excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of  interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the  visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia. An immediate  application of this technique is represented by educational classes.  ,  Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context:  The capability to print three-dimensional (3D) cellular tubes is not only a  logical first step towards successful organ printing but also a critical  indicator of the feasibility of the envisioned organ printing technology.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,ECM22 is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the  C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group P3(2) with unit-cell parameters a = 67.2, b = 67.2, c = 257.5 Å. The Matthews  coefficient was determined to be 3.41 Å(3) Da(-1) with two molecules in the  asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to solve the structure by the single-anomalous  ,  Context: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and  degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons. Gene  expression profiling experiments have shown that inactivation of the NMD pathway  leads to the accumulation of both aberrant, nonsense-containing mRNAs, and many  apparently wild-type transcripts. Such increases in transcript steady-state  levels could arise from direct changes in the respective mRNA half-lives, or  indirectly, as a consequence of the stabilization of transcripts encoding  specific regulatory proteins. Here, we distinguished direct from indirect  substrates by virtue of their association with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1 protein. Analyses of this dataset, and its comparison to the sets of transcripts  that respectively increase or decrease in abundance when NMD is either  inactivated or reactivated, indicate that the number of direct NMD substrates is larger than previously thought and that low abundance, alternatively transcribed  mRNAs, i.e., mRNAs whose 5' ends are derived from previously unannotated 5'  flanking sequences, comprise a significant class of direct substrates.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells originate from laryngeal cancer.," Context:  Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation. However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we  investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs  via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal  cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and  matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were  ,  Context: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of  cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients  with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have  refractory disease. This study aims at investigating the antitumor,  antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic activities of dovitinib in preclinical  models of HCC. METHODS: 21-0208 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the antitumor effect of dovitinib. Changes of biomarkers  relevant to FGFR/VEGFR/PDGFR pathways were determined by Western blotting.  Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by  immunohistochemistry.

Increasing SERCA2a expression in HF models improves cardiac  function. We used direct cardiac delivery of adeno-associated virus encoding  human SERCA2a (AAV6-hSERCA2a) in HF and normal canine models to study safety,  efficacy, and the effects of immunosuppression. Tachycardic-paced dogs received  left ventricle (LV) wall injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a or solvent. Pacing continued  postinjection for 2 or 6 weeks, until euthanasia. Tissue/serum samples were  analyzed for hSERCA2a expression (Western blot) and immune responses (histology and AAV6-neutralizing antibodies). Nonpaced dogs received AAV6-hSERCA2a and were  analyzed at 12 weeks; a parallel cohort received AAV-hSERCA2a and  immunosuppression. AAV-mediated cardiac expression of hSERCA2a peaked at 2 weeks and then declined (to ~50%; p<0.03, 6 vs. 2 weeks). LV end diastolic and end  systolic diameters decreased in 6-week dogs treated with AAV6-hSERCA2a (p<0.05)  whereas LV diameters increased in control dogs.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. In one study, 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period after intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm twist drill at the time of"," Context: MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to  ,  Context: RESULTS: Eight studies provided information on the survival rate, with a global  sample of 493 implants, being the weighted mean survival rate 95.6% (IC 95%),  after 52.7 months of follow-up. The level of implant penetration (≤ 4 mm or  > 4 mm) did not report statistically significant differences in survival rate  (p = 0.403). Seven studies provided information on the rate of clinical  complications, being the mean complication rate 3.4% (IC 95%). The most frequent  clinical complication was epistaxis, without finding significant differences  according to the level of penetration. Five studies provide information on the  radiographic complication; the most common complication was thickening of the Schneiderian membrane. The weighted complication rate was 14.8% (IC 95%), and  penetration level affects the rate of radiological complications, being these of  5.29% in implant penetrating ≤4 mm and 29.3% in implant penetrating > 4 mm, without reaching statistical significant difference (p = 0.301). CONCLUSION: The overall survival rate of the implants into the sinus cavity was  95.6%, without statistical differences according to the level of penetration.  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The Heyde syndrome describes the coincidence of aortic valve  stenosis and intestinal bleeding. The pathophysiologic link between both  entities has remained unclear so far. In several studies the intestinal  bleedings have been attributed to angiodysplasia. Cessations of the intestinal  bleedings following replacement of the aortic valve have been described by  numerous reports. CASE REPORT: We describe the history of a 70-year-old man with a calcified  aortic valve stenosis. In addition, he suffered from recurrent severe epistaxis  over several years. Replacement of the aortic valve by bioprosthesis resulted in  complete cessation of the nasal bleedings over a follow-up period of 6 years.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, AGY cannot be used as an antidiuretic replacement therapy. According to the study, AGY was taken by patients with biopsy-proven CD on a GFD and it lowered lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LM"," Context:  The prevalence and incidence of congestive heart failure continues to increase.  The two hallmarks of this syndrome, sodium and water retention, are frequently a  therapeutic challenge. Most conventional diuretics act primarily as saluretics by inhibiting renal tubular electrolyte reabsorption, which, due to osmotic  pressure, promotes excretion of isotonic fluid. The peptide hormone arginine  vasopressin vasoconstricts at the V(1A) receptor and promotes water reabsorption via the V(2) receptor in the renal collecting duct by inserting aquaporin-2  water channels into the luminal membrane. Tolvaptan, the first orally available  non-peptide V(2) receptor antagonist, acts as a potent aquaretic. In this paper,  ,  Context: METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily  Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and  acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were  identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness,  headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved  CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for  ,  Context: is much more variation in structure among the principles that resemble oxytocin.  The manner in which these evolved remains unclear. Arginine-vasotocin stimulates  smooth muscles from a wide variety of vertebrate species. It can stimulate  contraction of oviducts from many jawed fishes and tetrapods. The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals. Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.  ,  Context: endocrine dysfunction. We report 5 children with SOD, originally referred to be  evaluated due to short stature, who also presented bilateral optic nerve  hypoplasia, nystagmus and development delay. In 4 of the patients, we identified  neuroimaging abnormalities of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis such as anterior  pituitary hypoplasia (3/5), ectopic posterior pituitary (4/5), thin or absent  stalk (3/5) and empty sella (1/5). We also encountered diverse pituitary  deficiencies: growth hormone (3/5), adrenocorticotropic hormone (3/5),  thyroid-stimulating hormone (2/5) and antidiuretic hormone (1/5). Only one child  presented intact pituitary function and anatomy. Although rare, SOD is an important cause of congenital hypopituitarism and it should be considered in  children with optic nerve hypoplasia or midline brain abnormalities for early  diagnosis and treatment.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat endometriosis-associated pain, uterine leiomyomas (benign gynecological tumors), and prostate cancer."," Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin.

INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either  daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between  4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound  castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms  scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas.

Agnud1Delta and  Agcnm67Delta lack OPs; short and long cMTs emerged from the spindle pole body  bridge/half-bridge structures, explaining nuclear oscillation and bypassing in  these mutants. In Agstu2Delta only very short cMTs emanated from structurally  intact OPs; all nuclei moved with the cytoplasmic stream. Therefore, long tangential cMTs promote nuclear bypassing and short cMTs are important for  nuclear oscillation.

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"Yes, FPGA technology has been used to accelerate sequence alignment problems. A VHDL version of a reconfigurable systolic architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA to efficiently treat dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems such as global and local sequence"," Context: interconnections and operations even during run time (dynamically). We present a  reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient  treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known  problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string  matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability  was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of  sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of  this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate  array). It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman algorithm  is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences. When  searching sequence databases that may contain billions of sequences, this  algorithm becomes computationally expensive. Consequently, in this paper, we  focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the  computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. These simple modifications accelerated the algorithm runtime by an  average of 287% compared to the pure software implementation. Therefore, further  design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a promising direction to seeking runtime improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: New sequencing technologies generate larger amount of short reads  data at decreasing cost. De novo sequence assembly is the problem of combining  these reads back to the original genome sequence, without relying on a reference  genome. This presents algorithmic and computational challenges, especially for  long and repetitive genome sequences. Most existing approaches to the assembly  problem operate in the framework of de Bruijn graphs. Yet, a number of recent works use the paradigm of string graph, using a variety of methods for storing  and processing suffixes and prefixes, like suffix arrays, the Burrows-Wheeler  transform or the FM index.

We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques  with as low as 30-nm resolution, each focus may be further resolved, thus  increasing the number of foci per radiation dose compared to standard  microscopy. Furthermore, the DNA repair proteins 53BP1 (after low-LET irradiations) and Ku70/Ku80 (from laser microbeam irradiation) do not always  yield a significantly increased number of foci when imaged by the  super-resolution techniques, suggesting that γ-H2AX, 53PB1 and Ku70/80 repair proteins do not fully co-localize on the units of higher order chromatin  structure.  ,  Context: Cytokine storm defines a dysregulation of and an excessively exaggerated immune  response most often accompanying selected viral infections and several  autoimmune diseases.

The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Idasanutlin is a selective small-molecule MDM2 antagonist. It activates  the tumor suppressor TP53 and is in phase 3 clinical trial for acute myeloid  leukemia. Nonclinical studies have shown that glucuronidation is the major  metabolizing mechanism for idasanutlin and UGT1A3 is the major metabolizing  enzyme. There are reported examples of UGT polymorphisms associated with drug  metabolism or response. Thus, the aim of this analysis is to investigate if UGT polymorphism is associated with idasanutlin pharmacokinetics. METHOD: Idasanutlin clearance was derived and normalized from two phase I  studies. Its clearance level was compared between patients with different genotypes at 44 non-monomorphic UGT SNPs. Several single-locus and multi-locus  association analysis, including haplotype association analysis and pairwise SNP  interaction (epistasis) analyses were performed to investigate if there is any  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ","22139982, 30511219, 27031942, 23675939","CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant since they metabolize about 50% and 30% of the drugs on the market, respectively.",32786546
Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53. This regulation of cell stress response by HuR promotes cell survival. Additionally, HuR is involved in a positive feedback mechanism for its own regulation"," Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the  cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased  the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback mechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the  regulation of HuR during replicative senescence.  ,  Context: messages. The ARE is loosely defined as the five-nucleotide sequence AUUUA  embedded in a uracil-rich region. A transacting factor, presumably a protein,  binds the ARE and initiates recognition by the destabilization machinery.  Numerous candidate ARE-binding proteins have been proposed. We show that a 32  kDa protein in HeLa nuclear extracts characterized previously has RNA-binding  specificity that correlates with the activity of an ARE in directing mRNA decay.  Purification and subsequent analyses demonstrate that this 32 kDa protein is  identical to a recently identified member of the Elav-like gene family (ELG)  called HuR. The in vitro binding selectivity of HuR is indicative of an ARE sequence's ability to destabilize a mRNA in vivo, suggesting a critical role for  HuR in the regulation of mRNA degradation.  ,  Context: increase in the level of HuA. Upregulation of HuA corresponds to previously  documented increases in cytokine expression which are due to increased mRNA  stability following T cell activation. Consistent with these findings, HuA was  down regulated in quiescent cells and upregulated in 3T3 cells following serum  stimulation. The increase of murine HuA during the cell cycle closely resembles  that of cyclin B1 which peaks in G2/M. Together with our earlier studies, these  data indicate that mammalian ELAV proteins function during cell growth and  differentiation due in part to their effects on posttranscriptional stability  and translation of multiple growth regulatory mRNAs. This supports the hypothesis that ELAV proteins can function as transacting factors which affect a  default pathway of mRNA degradation involved in the expression of growth  regulatory proteins.  ","19884656, 20007147, 9155038, 9763509","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation, while others can inhibit nucleosome formation."," Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: are bound, suggesting other chromosomal features influence ORC binding. Using  high-throughput sequencing to map ORC binding and nucleosome positioning, we  show that yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned  nucleosomes flanking the ACS. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a  nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of  nucleosomes flanking the origin. These findings identify local nucleosomes as an  important determinant for origin selection and function.  ,  Context: there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture  of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem  cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of  nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data  with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a  determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions  characterized by a ""ground state"" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying  DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous  chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct  effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional  rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in  comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is a muscle-specific protein found in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, but it is not mentioned to be present in plants. However, plant keratin intermediate filaments are discussed separately, indicating that they are distinct from desmin"," Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.  ,  Context: and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin  vitro. In higher mcation images, it can be seen that fully assembled plant  keratin intermediate filaments consist of several thinner filaments of 3 nm in  diameter, which indicates the formation of protofilaments in the assembly  processes. One of the explicit features of plant keratin intermediate filaments  is a 24-25 nm periodic structural repeat alone the axis of both the 10 nm  filaments and protofilarnents. The periodic repeat is one of the fundamental  characteristic of all intermediate filaments, and demonstrates the half  staggered arrangement of keratin molecules within the filaments.  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context:  Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the  intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an  early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The  full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino  acids.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear.  We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated  JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to  chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2  revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an  important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of  MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin  distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by  which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment.  ,  Context: analysis revealed that ABCG1 may be involved in the regulation between lncRNA  AL355711 and MMP3 in atherosclerotic CAD. The knockdown of lncRNA AL355711  inhibited ABCG1 transcription and smooth muscle cell migration. In addition,  lncRNA AL355711 was found to regulate MMP3 expression through the ABCG1 pathway.  The expression of ABCG1 and MMP3 was found to be high in an animal model of  atherosclerosis. The results indicated that lncRNA AL355711 promoted VSMC  migration and atherosclerosis partly via the ABCG1/MMP3 pathway. On the whole,  the present study demonstrates that the inhibition of lncRNA AL355711 may serve  as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. lncRNA AL355711 in circulating leukocytes may be a novel biomarker for atherosclerotic CAD.  ,  Context: SAM and MTA doses, or 1/8 of the above MTA dose.

Exogenous MTA only induced the reconstitution  of MTA pool, without affecting SAM level and DNA methylation. Recovery of SAM and MTA pool and DNA methylation was found in the rats subjected to SAM plus  MTA, indicating the absence of inhibition of DNA methyltransferases in vivo by  MTA. MTA also inhibited liver reparative growth in partially hepatectomized rats, without modifying SAM content and DNA methylation of regenerating liver  (RL).

Chromatin conformation capture technologies  (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of  topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  ,  Context: packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome  organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin  packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized  segments that have much higher intrachromosome interaction rates than  neighboring regions, representing a dominant local structural feature of genome  conformation in A. thaliana. These regions, which appear as positive strips on  two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction, are enriched in  epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1, and H3.3. We also identify more than 400  insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not an obvious feature of A.  thaliana genome packing, we found more than 1000 regions that have properties of  TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions analogous to the interior of TADs. The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are  each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with  different gene expression levels.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,"Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose, lyophilized vaccine."," Context:  OBJECTIVE: To review trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Vaxchora, a  reformulated, single-dose, oral, lyophilized Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine  for the prevention of travel-related cholera caused by V cholerae serogroup O1. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946 to January  week 3, 2017) and EMBASE (1996 to 2017 week 3). Keywords included oral cholera  vaccine, single-dose, Vaxchora, and CVD 103-HgR. Limits included human, clinical trials published in English since 2010. ClinicalTrials.gov was used as a source  for unpublished data. Additional data sources were obtained through  bibliographic review of selected articles.  ,  Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera.

With  alglucerase infusions typical disease manifestations are ameliorated or  normalised: hepatosplenomegaly is reduced, haematological parameters improve,  and patients experience an increased quality of life usually within 4 to 6  months of treatment. Parameters of bone disease also respond, but generally over  a longer period of treatment. Alglucerase is well tolerated by children and  adults, with few adverse effects reported.

Several dosage regimens have been used to deliver alglucerase, and the comparative benefits of these remain controversial.  High-dose regimens of 60 IU/kg bodyweight administered every 2 weeks are clearly  effective; however, smaller dosages given more frequently are also effective and incur a greatly reduced acquisition cost.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The TLR7 locus is located on the X chromosome in the human genome.," Context: and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis,  which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover,  we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of  monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are  cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate  that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular  traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest  additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X  chromosome.  ,  Context: in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs,  monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B  cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven  functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent  autoimmune syndromes.  ,  Context: transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold  increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class  switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B  lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation  endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This  finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune  disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"The ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors are Slit proteins and NELL1/2. Specifically, Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2, which bind to the first fib"," Context: The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets. Roundabouts  comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors facilitating this  process upon interaction with the soluble extracellular ligand Slit protein  family emanating from the midline. Due to the complexity and flexible nature of  Robo receptors , their overall structure has remained elusive until now. Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  ,  Context: The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal  growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic  binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the  fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can  influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These  results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly  under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not  ,  Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways and induces apoptosis in cancer cells, such as SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Src has a critical role in tumor cell migration and invasion.  Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition.

Herein, the androgen and  AR-mediated mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression and establish  cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a critical therapeutic  target are briefly reviewed. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of  abiraterone are reviewed and its recently described activity against AR and  3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is discussed. The Phase I and II data initially  demonstrating the efficacy of abiraterone and Phase III data supporting its  approval for patients with metastatic CRPC are reviewed. The safety and  tolerability of abiraterone, including the incidence and management of side effects and potential drug interactions, are discussed. The current place of  abiraterone in CRPC therapy is reviewed and early evidence regarding  cross-resistance of abiraterone with taxane therapy, mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone, and observations of an abiraterone withdrawal response are  presented. Future directions in the use of abiraterone, including optimal dosing  strategies, the role of abiraterone in earlier disease settings, including  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men  in the United States. The disease is driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling,  and the majority of patients initially respond to androgen deprivation  therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain  ,  Context: Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and  abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss  of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH), providing a rationale for development of CYP17 inhibitors with increased  specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and VT-464) that can  potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids. In this article,  we review the development of abiraterone and other CYP17 inhibitors; recent  studies with abiraterone that inform our understanding of clinical parameters  such as drug effects on quality-of-life, potential early predictors of response,  and optimal sequencing of abiraterone with respect to other agents; and results of translational studies providing insights into resistance mechanisms to CYP17  inhibitors leading to clinical trials with drug combinations designed to prolong  abiraterone benefit or restore abiraterone activity.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context:  Waardenburg Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by  sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary abnormalities of the eyes, hair, and  skin. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene mutations account for about 15% of WS type II (WS2) cases. To date, fewer than 40  different MITF gene mutations have been identified in human WS2 patients, and  few of these were of Chinese descent. In this study, we report clinical findings and mutation identification in the MITF gene of 20 Chinese WS2 patients from 14  families. A high level of clinical variability was identified.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines do not have a direct effect on fat tissue. However, they can affect mitochondrial O2 consumption and H2O2 production in rat liver mitochondria, which could indirectly influence metabolic processes, including lipogenesis and lipolysis,"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We  propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent  ,  Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1  ,  Context: The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport  reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the  mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT  is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that  CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by  anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD+. After treatment of the  mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in  proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V max was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not  able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts,  indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix.  ,  Context: initiate synaptic transmission. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, we  identified de novo CACNA1E variants in 30 individuals with DEE, characterized by  refractory infantile-onset seizures, severe hypotonia, and profound  developmental impairment, often with congenital contractures, macrocephaly,  hyperkinetic movement disorders, and early death. Most of the 14, partially  recurring, variants cluster within the cytoplasmic ends of all 4 S6 segments,  which form the presumed CaV2.3 channel activation gate. Functional analysis of  several S6 variants revealed consistent gain-of-function effects comprising  facilitated voltage-dependent activation and slowed inactivation. Another variant located in the domain II S4-S5 linker results in facilitated activation  and increased current density. Five participants achieved seizure freedom on the  antiepileptic drug topiramate, which blocks R-type calcium channels.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  ,  Context:  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1. Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR  complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in  cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1),  consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8  (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of  mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated  protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both  complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members:  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKCα (protein kinase Cα) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced  protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated  single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of  Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2  components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex.

Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up.

However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain.

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, and even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases."," Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease.

The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter  modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is  likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: The nematode C. elegans is a useful model organism for studying neuronal  development and function due to its extremely simple, well-defined nervous  system, translucence, short life cycle, and abundance of genetic tools  (WormBase. http://wormbase.org , 2018; WormBook.

Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac  ,  Context: Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  oxide (NO), elevated cell adhesion molecules, and decreased angiogenic growth  factors.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context: FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation. Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed through S1P receptors expressed on the surface of various cells including  neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessel endothelial cells. These  functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems,  ,  Context: groups assigned to receive intravenous evinacumab at a dose of 15 mg per  kilogram and 5 mg per kilogram and the placebo group were -50.5 percentage  points (P<0.001) and -24.2 percentage points, respectively. The incidence of  serious adverse events during the treatment period ranged from 3 to 16% across  trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia, the use of  evinacumab significantly reduced the LDL cholesterol level, by more than 50% at  the maximum dose. (Funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov  number, NCT03175367.).  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose  of this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2  inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms ""SGLT2"" and ""SGLT2  inhibitor"" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes.

Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks  of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice.

High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  ,  Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: comparative analysis, the evolution of RNA structure in this family of molecules  derived from 7SL RNA. RNA sequences of different simian (mostly human) and  prosimian Alu subfamilies as well as rodent B1 repeats were derived from their  genomic consensus sequences taken from the literature and our unpublished  results (prosimian and New World Monkey). RNA secondary structures were  determined by enzymatic studies (new data on 4.5S RNA are presented) and/or  energy minimization analyses followed by phylogenetic comparison. Although, with  the exception of 4.5S RNA, all 7SL-derived RNA species maintain the cruciform  structure of their progenitor, the details of 7SL RNA folding domains are modified to a different extent in various RNA groups. Novel motifs found in  retropositionally active RNAs are conserved among Alu and B1 subfamilies in  different genomes. In RNAs that do not proliferate by retroposition these motifs are modified further.

CONCLUSIONS: Combining lacticin 3147 with low levels of a polymyxin could  provide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also  reducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of  synergy.  ,  Context: inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against  UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin  antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: and 25 comparators by reference broth microdilution methods. The most frequent  carbapenemase was KPC-2 or -3 (73 strains), followed by VIM-1 (14), IMP-1 (11),  SME-2 (5), and NMC-A (1). All serine carbapenemases were detected in the United  States, while MbetaL-producing strains were isolated in Europe.  Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of resistance to  most antimicrobial agents tested. The rank order of in vitro activity against  these strains was as follows: tigecycline (100.0% susceptible) > polymyxin B  (88.1%) > amikacin (73.0%) > imipenem (37.5%). Tigecycline was very active  (MIC(90), 1 microg/ml) against this significant, contemporary collection of well-characterized strains and appears to be an excellent option compared to the  polymyxins for treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae.
