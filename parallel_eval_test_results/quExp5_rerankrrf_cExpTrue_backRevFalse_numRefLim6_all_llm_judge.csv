What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9), plays a critical role in medulloblastoma. The identification of recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes"," Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.  ,  Context: The transcriptional output at a genomic locus in eukaryotes is determined, in  part, by the pattern of histone modifications that are read and interpreted by  key effector proteins. The histone deacetylase activity of the evolutionarily  conserved Rpd3S/Sin3S complex is crucial for suppressing aberrant transcription  from cryptic start sites within intragenic regions of actively transcribed  genes. Precise targeting of the complex relies on the chromatin binding  activities of the MRG15 (MRG stands for mortality factor on chromosome 4 related  gene) and Pf1 subunits. Whereas the molecular target of the MRG15 chromodomain  (CD) has been suggested to be H3K36me(2/3), the precise molecular target of the Pf1 plant homeodomain 1 (PHD1) has remained elusive. Here, we show that Pf1 PHD1  binds preferentially to the unmodified extreme N-terminus of histone H3  (H3K4me(0)) but not to H3K4me(2/3), which are enriched in the promoter and 5' regions of genes. Unlike previously characterized CD and PHD domains that bind  to their targets with micromolar affinity, both MRG15 CD and Pf1 PHD1 bind to  their targets with >100 Î¼M affinity, offering an explanation for why both MRG15  ,  Context: A host of cancer types exhibit aberrant histone modifications. Recently,  distinct and recurrent mutations in a specific histone variant, histone H3.3,  have been implicated in a high proportion of malignant pediatric brain cancers.  The presence of mutant H3.3 histone disrupts epigenetic posttranslational  modifications near genes involved in cancer processes and in brain function.  Here, we review possible mechanisms by which mutant H3.3 histones may act to  promote tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we discuss how perturbations in normal H3.3  chromatin-related and epigenetic functions may more broadly contribute to the  formation of human cancers.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma is a cerebellar tumor affecting children and young adults, and  accounts for approximately one fifth of all pediatric brain tumors. Despite  multimodal therapy that includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy,  recurrence is frequent and overall mortality rate remains relatively high.  Moreover, radiation therapy results in severe effects on intellect, and younger  age of treatment correlates with larger deficits. Improvements in therapy of this childhood tumor will focus increasingly on the clarification of the exact  cellular origin and the genetic mechanisms contributing to tumor formation, and  on new targeted therapeutic options. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but  deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor  (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed  classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier,  making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The MethPed R package efficiently classifies pediatric brain tumors  using the developed MethPed classifier. MethPed is available via Bioconductor:  http://bioconductor.org/packages/MethPed/.  ,  Context: Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain  tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To  assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify  critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status  of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),  CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG  methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the  cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus  0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a  subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent  ","19270706, 22728643, 24229707, 19747111, 27370569, 14688019","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418",1.0,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.],1.0
What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"There is no explicit mention of the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation. However, it is mentioned that simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation, suggesting a potential role in cell growth or survival"," Context: We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell  proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout. We  provide strong evidence that STAG1 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers  with inactivating alterations of STAG2.  ,  Context: implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of  differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with  significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined  categorization of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) according to the normalization  of cDNA libraries allows searching for putative low-abundant transcripts. The  results are tightly linked to our visualization tools, GeneNest (expression  patterns of genes) and SpliceNest (gene structure and alternative splicing). The  user-friendly interface of T-STAG offers a platform for comprehensive analysis  of tissue and/or tumor-specific expression patterns revealed by the EST data. T-STAG is freely accessible at http://tstag.molgen.mpg.de.  ,  Context: Sister chromatid cohesion mediated by the cohesin complex is essential for  chromosome segregation during cell division. Using functional genomic screening,  we identify a set of 26 pre-mRNA splicing factors that are required for sister  chromatid cohesion in human cells. Loss of spliceosome subunits increases the  dissociation rate of cohesin from chromatin and abrogates cohesion after DNA  replication, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe. Depletion of splicing  factors causes defective processing of the pre-mRNA encoding sororin, a factor  required for the stable association of cohesin with chromatin, and an associated  reduction of sororin protein level. Expression of an intronless version of sororin and depletion of the cohesin release protein WAPL suppress the cohesion  defect in cells lacking splicing factors. We propose that spliceosome components  contribute to sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic chromosome segregation through splicing of sororin pre-mRNA. Our results highlight the loss of cohesion  as an early cellular consequence of compromised splicing. This may have clinical  implications because SF3B1, a splicing factor that we identify to be essential  ,  Context: In the developing nervous system, differentiating neurons express Delta and  activate Notch signaling in their neighboring cells. As a result of Notch  activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they  remain neural progenitor cells. Thus, differentiation of neurons and maintenance  of neural progenitor cells are well balanced owing to Notch signaling. Recent  studies revealed that Notch signaling is under the control of more complex and  dynamic regulation than previously thought, such as cell cycle dependent  activation and oscillating gene expression. We discuss here recent advances in  understanding how Notch signaling is regulated in the developing nervous system and what outcome each type of regulation of Notch signaling leads to. We  highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of  neural progenitor cells.  ,  Context: RESULTS: In our in vitro model, T3 inhibited cell proliferation and stimulated  neurite outgrowth of differentiating ENS progenitor cells. Microarray analysis  revealed a group of 338 genes that were regulated by T3 in differentiating  enterospheres. 67 of these genes are involved in function and development of the  nervous system. 14 of them belong to genes that are involved in axonal guidance  or neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, T3 regulated the expression of netrin G1  and endothelin 3, two guidance molecules that are involved in human enteric  dysganglionoses. CONCLUSION: The results of our study give first insights how T3 may affect the  enteric nervous system. T3 is involved in proliferation and differentiation processes in enterospheres. Microarray analysis revealed several interesting  gene candidates that might be involved in the observed effects on enterosphere  differentiation. Future studies need to be conducted to better understand the gene to gene interactions.  ,  Context: level in the milk and its changes during lactation suggest a possible effect of  PACAP on the differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Mammary cell  differentiation is regulated by hormones, growth factors, cytokines/chemokines,  and angiogenic proteins. In this study, differentiation was hormonally induced  by lactogenic hormones in confluent cultures of HC11 mouse mammary epithelial  cells. We investigated the effect of PACAP on mammary cell differentiation as  well as release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Differentiation  was assessed by expression analysis of the milk protein Î²-casein.  Differentiation significantly decreased the secretion of interferon gammainduced protein (IP)-10, ""regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and  presumably secreted"" (RANTES), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  (IGFBP)-3 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin (AREG). The changes in the levels  of IP-10 and RANTES may be relevant for the alterations in homing of T cells and  B cells at different stages of mammary gland development, while the changes of  ","28430577, 15980556, 25257310, 19783418, 24013065, 24323361",STAG1/STAG2 proteins are tumour suppressor proteins that suppress cell proliferation and are essential for differentiation.,"26997282, 21589869, 19822671, 29867216, 15361841, 28430577, 27298259, 12034751, 18276799",0.0,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],1.0
What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"In the highest tertile (>426 hours) of cumulative use, a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma, indicating an increased risk"," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for  astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The  results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was  observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to  earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.  ,  Context: Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of  a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young  adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor  cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and  (11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish studies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10). The data from the Swedish studies are  consistent with what would be expected if cellphone use were a risk for brain  tumors, while the Interphone studies data are incredulous. If a risk does exist,  ,  Context: useful and predictive. Previous studies explain why multifocal recurrence is  inevitable and show how various treatment scenarios have been incorporated in  the model. In most tumours, it is not known when the cancer started. Based on  patient in vivo parameters, obtained from two brain scans, it is shown how to  estimate the time, after initial detection, when the tumour started. This is an  input of potential importance in any future controlled clinical study of any  connection between cell phone radiation and brain tumour incidence. It is also  used to estimate more accurately survival times from detection. Finally, based  on patient parameters, the solution of the model equation of the tumour growth helps to explain why certain patients live longer than others after similar  treatment protocols specifically surgical resection (removal) and irradiation.  ,  Context:  There is considerable controversy surrounding the biological effects of  radiofrequency (RF) fields, as emitted by mobile phones. Previous work from our  laboratory has shown no effect related to the exposure of 1.9 GHz pulse-modulated RF fields on the expression of 22,000 genes in a human  glioblastoma-derived cell-line (U87MG) at 6 h following a 4 h RF field exposure  period. As a follow-up to this study, we have now examined the effect of RF field exposure on the possible expression of late onset genes in U87MG cells  after a 24 h RF exposure period. In addition, a human monocyte-derived cell-line  (Mono-Mac-6, MM6) was exposed to intermittent (5 min ON, 10 min OFF) RF fields  ,  Context: radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer.  RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however.

What is the applicability of the No Promoter Left Behind method?,"The No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) method is applicable for characterizing diverse promoter architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide transcription start sites (TSSs), without relying on known promoter elements. It can be used to identify novel architectures"," Context: Promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes  differently. For example, some have a TATA-box, many others do not. Even the  ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription start site  (TSS). No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent  method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from  experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements. As a test case, we show its application in identifying novel  architectures in the fly genome.

CONTACT: l.narlikar@ncl.res.in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: have used Softberry gene finding software to predict genes, pseudogenes and  promoters in 44 selected ENCODE sequences representing approximately 1% (30 Mb)  of the human genome. Predictions of gene finding programs were evaluated in  terms of their ability to reproduce the ENCODE-HAVANA annotation. RESULTS: The Fgenesh++ gene prediction pipeline can identify 91% of coding  nucleotides with a specificity of 90%. Our automatic pseudogene finder (PSF  program) found 90% of the manually annotated pseudogenes and some new ones. The  Fprom promoter prediction program identifies 80% of TATA promoters sequences  with one false positive prediction per 2,000 base-pairs (bp) and 50% of TATA-less promoters with one false positive prediction per 650 bp. It can be  used to identify transcription start sites upstream of annotated coding parts of  genes found by gene prediction software. CONCLUSION: We review our software and underlying methods for identifying these  three important structural and functional genome components and discuss the  accuracy of predictions, recent advances and open problems in annotating genomic  ,  Context: receptor gamma 2 subunit, GABRG2. The phenotypic heterogeneity that is  characteristic of GEFS+ families is likely to be due to modifier genes.  Interpretation of the significance of a SCN1A missense mutation requires a  thorough understanding of the phenotypes in the GEFS+ spectrum whereas a de novo  truncation mutation is likely to be associated with a severe phenotype.

As only unsatisfactory prediction values for other  prodromal symptom definitions were reported, e.g. the commonly used DSM-III-R  definition, empirical evidence for the possibility of diagnosing schizophrenia  as early as in the initial prodromal stage, has been found for the first time.  In the following, this article considers essential initiatives for the  development, performance and evaluation of a promising early intervention  programme based on the results found. In Germany, within the project unit ""Early Recognition and Intervention"" of the competence network ""Schizophrenia"", such a  programme has been initiated. Late prodromal stages are defined by attenuated or  transient psychotic symptoms and early prodromal stages by the presence of at least one of the highly predictive prodromal symptoms from the CER-study or  decline in psychic functions in combination with other risk factors.  Intervention strategies are a multimodal psychological programme for the  ,  Context: presented as a tutorial at the conference on Intelligent Systems in Molecular  Biology (ISMB-99) in August 1999. Over 95% of the coding nucleotides in the  region were correctly identified by the majority of the gene finders, and the  correct intron/exon structures were predicted for >40% of the genes.  Homology-based annotation techniques recognized and associated functions with  almost half of the genes in the region; the remainder were only identified by  the ab initio techniques. This experiment also presents the first assessment of  promoter prediction techniques for a significant number of genes in a large  contiguous region. We discovered that the promoter predictors' high false-positive rates make their predictions difficult to use. Integrating gene  finding and cDNA/EST alignments with promoter predictions decreases the number  of false-positive classifications but discovers less than one-third of the promoters in the region. We believe that by establishing standards for  evaluating genomic annotations and by assessing the performance of existing  automated genome annotation tools, this experiment establishes a baseline that  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Clinical decision rules (CDRs) for paediatric head injury (HI) exist  to identify children at risk of traumatic brain injury.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context:  Identification of new nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biomarkers is of great  clinical value for the diagnosis and treatment of NPC. HOTAIR, a cancer-related  long non-coding RNA, was tested and its prognostic value for NPC was evaluated. As determined using in situ hybridization (ISH), 91 of 160 (56.87%)  paraffin-embedded NPC biopsies showed high expression levels of HOTAIR (staining  index score â¥ 6). HOTAIR was upregulated in tumors with a large size (PÂ =Â 0.021), more advanced clinical stage (PÂ =Â 0.012) and increased lymph node  tumor burden (PÂ =Â 0.005). Quantified using real-time PCR, HOTAIR expression  levels in fresh tissue and paraffin-embedded samples were 5.2Â ~Â 48.4-fold higher  ,  Context: to chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004  and has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora  M. Hansen, and Barbara Susnik answered questions regarding the incorporation of  the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay into routine clinical practice. This expert  dialog offers an update and clinical insights into when, how, and why clinicians  might incorporate the Oncotype DX assay into the management of their breast  cancer patients. Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX  assay in node-positive patients is discussed. Finally, sample case studies offer  clinically relevant examples of the practical application of the Oncotype DX  assay.  ,  Context: suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes  related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR)  expression.

The data were  correlated with patient age, tumor size, histologic type,  Scarff-Bloom-Richardson score, histologic grade, and progesterone receptor  status. The median FOXA1 and GATA3 scores were 240 and 200, respectively. The  Oncotype DX recurrence scores were low in 57%, intermediate in 30%, and high in  13% of cases. FOXA1 expression correlated negatively with Oncotype DX recurrence  scores (P=0.004), and histologic type (P=0.0004). Oncotype DX recurrences score also correlated negatively with progesterone receptor (P=0.035) with 100% of  progesterone receptor-negative cases having high or intermediate Oncotype DX  scores. FOXA1 and GATA3 expressions correlated positively (P=0.014). The correlation between FOXA1 expression and Oncotype DX recurrence scores remained  significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons and controlling for  confounders such as histological type, grade, and progesterone receptor.

Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DXÂ® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue.

The clinical syndrome associates dementia,  parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse  Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: We proposed the term 'Lewy body disease' (LBD) in 1980. Subsequently, we  classified LBD into three types according to the distribution pattern of Lewy  bodies: a brainstem type, a transitional type and a diffuse type. Later, we  added the cerebral type. As we have proposed since 1980, LBD has recently been  used as a generic term, including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with  dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. LBD has neuropathological  characteristics whereby numerous Lewy bodies are present in the central and  sympathetic nervous systems, and it is a type of alpha-synucleinopathy because  the main component of Lewy body is alpha-synuclein. In this paper we explain the most recent concept of LBD from the historical viewpoint.  ,  Context: according to the behavioral state, including the sleep-wake cycle. Several  components of the central autonomic networks are affected in neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions containing  Î±-synuclein. These include multiple system atrophy (MSA), characterized by  accumulation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and Lewy body disorders, including  Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and the so-called ""pure""  autonomic failure. In MSA, involvement of the rostral ventrolateral medulla may  be primarily responsible for orthostatic hypotension; involvement in the pontine  micturition area, sacral preganglionic nucleus, and Onuf nucleus is responsible for neurogenic bladder; and involvement of the pre-BÃ¶tzinger complex and  medullary raphe may contribute to sleep-related respiratory abnormalities. In  contrast, Lewy body disorders are characterized by early involvement of the enteric nervous system and cardiac sympathetic ganglia. The dorsal motor nucleus  of the vagus is affected both in MSA and at early stages of PD.  ,  Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of Î±-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated Î±-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and Î±-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: fixed brain sections or isolated from cortical tissues of dementia with Lewy  bodies. Lewy bodies exhibited a range of labeling patterns for alpha-synuclein  and ubiquitin, from a homogeneous pattern in which alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin  were evenly distributed and overlapped across the inclusion body to a concentric  pattern in which alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin were partially segregated, with  alpha-synuclein labeling concentrated in the peripheral domain and ubiquitin in  the central domain of the Lewy body. Lipids represented a significant component  in both homogeneous and concentric Lewy bodies. These results suggest that Lewy  bodies are heterogeneous in their subregional composition. The segregation of alpha-synuclein to Lewy body peripheral domain is consistent with the hypothesis  that alpha-synuclein is continually deposited onto Lewy bodies.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB), Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS)."," Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group ï¼AHI<5ï¼ 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild ï¼AHI 5-15ï¼, moderateï¼AHI 16-30ï¼  and severe OSA groupï¼AHI>30ï¼ according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: the NoSAS score with the STOP-Bang questionnaire. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients from a sleep clinic who had undergone  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) testing by type III portable monitor device at the  hospital and completed the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score was assessed  by reviewing medical records. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive  value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUC) of both screening tools were calculated at different  AHI cutoffs to compare the performance of SDB screening. RESULTS: Of the 596 eligible patients (397 males and 199 female), 514 were diagnosed with SDB. When predicting overall (AHIââ¥â5), moderate-to-severe  (AHIââ¥â15), and severe (AHIââ¥â30) SDB, the sensitivity and specificity of the  NoSAS score were 71.2, 80.4, and 83.1% and 62.4, 49.3, and 40.7%, respectively. At all AHI cutoffs, the AUC ranged from 0.688 to 0.715 for the NoSAS score and  from 0.663 to 0.693 for the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score had the  largest AUC (0.715, 95% CI: 0.655-0.775) of diagnosing SDB at AHI cutoff of â¥5  ,  Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of â¥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: questionnaires were collected, after which the NoSAS score was compared against  the other questionnaires for SDB screening. RESULTS: A total of 2,208 participants were enrolled in this study. The NoSAS  scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of â¥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening. A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,Raoultella terrigena is a bacterial species associated with Tetrodotoxin (TTX) production.," Context: gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.  ,  Context: Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is  the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of  the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS) analysis revealed that the pufferfish larvae contain a small quantity of TTX,  which is not enough to be lethal to the predators. Immunohistochemical analysis  with anti-TTX monoclonal antibody revealed that the TTX is primarily localized in the body surface of the larvae as a layer of protection. Our study showed the  female parent of the Takifugu pufferfish vertically transfers TTX to the larvae  through its accumulation in the ovaries, and subsequent localization on the body  ,  Context: Advances in tandem mass spectrometry (tandem MS) and sequencing have enabled the  field of community proteomics, which seeks to identify expressed proteins, their  sequence variability, and the physiological responses of organisms to variable  environmental conditions. Bottom-up tandem MS-based community proteomic  approaches generate fragmentation spectra from peptides. Fragmentation spectra  are then searched against genomic or metagenomic databases to deduce the amino  acid sequences of peptides, providing positive identifications for proteins.  Marine community proteomic studies have verified the importance of nutrient  transport, energy generation, and carbon fixation functions in bacteria and archaea and revealed spatial and temporal shifts in the expressed functions of  communities. Here, we discuss sample collection, preparation, and processing  methods for planktonic tandem MS-based community proteomics.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters,  especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to  the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Benthic organisms such as mollusks and echinoderms, with  different feeding habits, were collected monthly along the Portuguese coast from  the summer of 2009 until the end of 2010. The extraction and analysis techniques were optimized and TTX and some analogues were detected for the first time in  two intertidal gastropod species-Gibbula umbilicalis and Monodonta lineata by  LC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS/MS. Although the levels are low, these findings suggest  ,  Context: Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease that can occur in all warm-blooded animals,  birds, and fishes. The disease in animals is mainly caused by toxins produced by  Clostridium botulinum strains belonging to group III, although outbreaks due to  toxins produced by group I and II organisms have been recognized. Group III  strains are capable of producing botulinum toxins of type C, D, and C/D and D/C  mosaic variants. Definitive diagnosis of animal botulism is made by combining  clinical findings with laboratory investigations. Detection of toxins in  clinical specimens and feed is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis. Since  toxins may be degraded by organisms contained in the gastrointestinal tract or may be present at levels below the detection limit, the recovery of C. botulinum  from sick animal specimens is consistent for laboratory confirmation. In this  article we report the development and in-house validation of a new multiplex real-time PCR for detecting and typing the neurotoxin genes found in C.  botulinum group III organisms.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context: in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation  that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the  novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on  preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.  Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator  requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth to capture  low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our  estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a  consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that  genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs.  Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele.  We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until  ,  Context:  Positive selection occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The  frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and due to genetic  hitchhiking the neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved  by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of  reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular LD patterns in the region. A variety of methods and tools can be used  for detecting sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary  statistics such as Tajima's D, to more advanced statistical approaches that use  ,  Context: the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.  ,  Context:  Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such  as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply  of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Adaptive alleles may rise in frequency as a consequence of positive  selection, creating a pattern of decreased variation in the neighboring loci,  known as a selective sweep. When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele  frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large  genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a  consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population.

List markers for autophagy.,"Markers for autophagy include ATG5, LC3II, and p62/SQSTM1. Additionally, phosphorylated Î±-synuclein is also a marker for autophagy."," Context: mechanism, it can mediate programmed cell death in several conditions.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the  crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.  Various methods have been used to detect the marker genes and the proteins  involved in these processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method for  monitoring the expression of genes involved in autophagy or autophagic cell  death is often preferred because of its sensitivity, high efficiency potential,  accurate quantification, and high-grade potential automation. The detection of  the markers for autophagy-related process by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of various patient tissues has become a reliable method for monitoring  autophagy. Here, we introduce protocols for detecting autophagy and  autophagy-associated cell death in HeLa cells by using gene expression assays qRT-PCR, and also in paraffin-embedded tissue section from human biopsy material  by using immunohistochemistry.  ,  Context: Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (PÃ©rez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture. Thus,  in this chapter, we describe how to generate OIS cells using human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), the best-characterized cell model of OIS, and how to detect  autophagy, particularly focusing on immunofluorescence methods.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Autophagy induction can increase or decrease anticancer drug  efficacy. Anticancer drug-induced autophagy induction is poorly characterized in  osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on camptothecin (CPT)-induced cytotoxicity in OS. METHODS: Autophagy-inhibited DLM8 and K7M3 metastatic murine OS cell lines were  generated by infection with lentiviral shRNA directed against the essential autophagy protein ATG5. Knockdown of ATG5 protein expression and inhibition of  autophagy was confirmed by immunoblot of ATG5 and LC3II proteins, respectively.  Metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay and cell viability was determined  ,  Context: Î±-Synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the intraneuronal inclusion  bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Although Î±-synuclein accumulation  is caused by inhibition of proteasome and autophagy-lysosome, the degradation of  Î±-synuclein inclusions is still unknown. Formation of Lewy body-like inclusions  can be replicated in cultured cells by introducing Î±-synuclein fibrils generated  in vitro. We used this cell culture model to investigate the autophagy of Î±-synuclein inclusions and impaired mitochondria. The intracellular Î±-synuclein  inclusions immediately underwent phosphorylation and ubiquitination.  Simultaneously they were encircled by an adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 and directed to the autophagy-lysosome pathway in HEK293 cell line.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation."," Context: CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation  have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the  importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.  ,  Context:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. At  present, the molecular mechanisms underlying ROP are still far from being  clearly understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of noncoding RNAs, have been reported to serve vital regulatory roles in several human diseases.  However, it is still unclear how circRNAs are involved in ROP. In the present  study, oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) murine retinal samples and paired normal tissues were chosen for high-throughput transcriptome RNA sequencing and  bioinformatic analyses. As a result, a total of 236 differentially expressed  circRNAs, 14 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 9,756 differentially expressed  ,  Context:  Most RNAs generated by the human genome have no protein-coding ability and are  termed non-coding RNAs. Among these include circular RNAs, which include exonic  circular RNAs (circRNA), mainly found in the cytoplasm, and intronic RNAs (ciRNA), predominantly detected in the nucleus. The biological functions of  circular RNAs remain largely unknown, although ciRNAs have been reported to  promote gene transcription, while circRNAs may function as microRNA sponges. We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer  cells and were associated with cell cycle progression. Silencing endogenous  circ-Foxo3 promoted cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that,  unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene  regulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an  increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs  are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have  been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization.  Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to  suppress microRNAs, thereby increasing the translation and stability of the targets of such microRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging functions of  circRNAs, including RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation. We  also discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function depending on the cell context, such as circRNA abundance, subcellular  localization, interacting partners (RNA, DNA, and proteins), dynamic changes in  interactions following stimulation, and potential circRNA translation.

The most commonly used  PrEP medication (TruvadaÂ® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1  reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV  NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV  antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation  screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult  to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be  highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone' reactivity on HIV NAT and serological tests, which is an unusual pattern in  acutely HIV-infected blood donors.

Aberrant rereplication correlates  with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation  (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse  embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or  cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an  artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC)  in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20  methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding  properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in  higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context:  The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that  protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, according to the provided text, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer."," Context: Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability  in cancer. In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of  focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors.  However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial  cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype,  whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  ,  Context:  Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging  disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced  ""progerin"" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression  changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown  that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of  stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA  sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also  ,  Context: creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As  replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the  presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as  secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene  transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their  stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in  incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a  concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication  initiation and replication fork stabilization.  ,  Context:  Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the  lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability.  To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and  replication are co-directional. Virtually all bacteria have the highly expressed  ribosomal RNA genes co-directional with replication. In bacteria, co-directional encounters seem inevitable because the rate of replication is about 10-20-fold  greater than the rate of transcription. However, these encounters are generally  thought to be benign.

Do IEG create a ripple effect of transcription?,"Yes, intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci, creating a ripple effect of transcription. This is demonstrated by the simultaneous activation of transcription centred on immediate-early genes (IEGs) and their neighbouring genes, as"," Context: most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is  possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous  neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus  frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of  immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is  accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the  primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated  simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding  intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG  induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional  activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated  expression.  ,  Context: knock-out cells. Conversely, in LRP5 knockdown preadipocytes, insulin-induced  phosphorylation of IRS1, Akt, GSK3Î², and ERK1/2 is highly reduced. This effect  is specific to insulin, as compared with IGF-1, stimulation and appears to be  due to an inducible interaction between LRP5 and the insulin receptor as  demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These data demonstrate that Wnt and  insulin signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk at multiple levels. Wnt induces  phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3Î², and this is dependent on  insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Insulin signaling also involves the Wnt co-receptor  LRP5, which has a positive effect on insulin signaling. Thus, altered Wnt and LRP5 activity can serve as modifiers of insulin action and insulin resistance in  the pathophysiology of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.  ,  Context: Insulin plays a very important role in maintaining homeostasis of the whole  organism. It regulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, lipid and protein  metabolism. Insulin receptors are present in virtually all cells, which is  reflected by the diversity of regulatory processes in which this hormone is  involved. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin  receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance, including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome,  which differ in the level of severity. Molecular analysis of insulin receptor  gene may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying various types of insulin resistance and help to develop a more efficient  treatment. They may also be used as a powerful tool in prenatal diagnostics as  well as in pregnancy planning.  ,  Context: turnover of cyclin D1, leading to a deficiency of active CDK4/cyclin D1  complexes, all of which potentially contribute to the prominent inhibitory  effects of rapamycin at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Rapamycin and  rapamycin analogues have demonstrated impressive growth-inhibitory effects  against a broad range of human cancers, including breast cancer, in preclinical  and early clinical evaluations. In breast cancer cells, PI3K/Akt and mTOR  pathways seem to be critical for the proliferative responses mediated by the  epidermal growth factor receptor, the insulin growth factor receptor, and the  estrogen receptor. Furthermore, these pathways may be constitutively activated in cancers with many types of aberrations, including those with loss of PTEN  suppressor gene function. Therefore, the development of inhibitors of mTOR and  related pathways is a rational therapeutic strategy for breast and other malignancies that possess a wide range of aberrant molecular constituents.

To our knowledge, although China has large population of persons with  hemophilia, there is rare information on the incidence, clinical feature, image  finding, and management of pseudotumor among Chinese patients. This study aimed  at improving our knowledge on clinical diagnosis and management of hemophiliac  pseudotumor. In this retrospective study, the medical records of 1248 patients with hemophilia diagnosed between January 1983 and October 2004 at our hospital  were reviewed. The clinical feature, imaging finding, management, and outcome of  14 patients with pseudotumor among these patients with hemophilia were analyzed. All patients have hemophilia A (8 severe cases and 6 moderate cases). Eight  patients sustained an injury prior to the development of pseudotumor. Main image  findings included osteolysis lesion, soft tissue swelling, or lump. Surgical  ,  Context: in developed countries. However, they are more difficult to come by in China.  Additionally, patients often have to undergo surgery for giant masses and suffer  complications. We wanted to present our experience in the surgical management of  hemophilic pseudotumors over a 40-year period. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 429 hemorrhagic coagulopathy patients  between 1983 and 2015. Diagnosis of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed  following clinical, radiological, and pathological criteria. The data were  recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor,  etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical management and outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen pseudotumor patients underwent surgical treatment. All of them  were male, with mean age of 34.3Â years. Fifteen patients had hemophilia A and three patients had hemophilia B. There were twelve proximal and two distal  pseudotumor patients. The mean follow-up was 51.9Â months. For pseudotumors in  the extremities, complete surgical resection was achieved. For four patients  ,  Context: PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 31 years old male patient, with severe hemophilia A.  Diagnosed with an abdominal tumor 10 years ago during routine screening, that  progressively grew to encompass the entire abdominal area, with symptoms of  intestinal obstruction. DISCUSSION: Hemophilic pseudotumor appears as a painless tumor of slow growth  that can compress vital organs producing bone destruction, muscle and skin  necrosis. The tumor may have fistulas or break spontaneously.  CONCLUSION: The abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare pathological entity,  with few reports worldwide, but must be considered in hemophilic patients with a  well documented abdominal tumor.  ,  Context: Hemophilic pseudotumor involving the spine is extremely uncommon and presents a  challenging problem. Preoperative planning, angiography, intra and perioperative  monitoring with factor VIII cover and postoperative care for hemophilic  pseudotumor is vital. Recognition of the artery of Adamkiewicz in the  thoracolumbar junction helps to avoid intraoperative neurological injury. We  report the case of a 26-year-old male patient with hemophilia A, who presented with a massive pseudotumor involving the first lumbar vertebra and the left  iliopsoas. Preoperative angiography revealed the artery of Adamkiewicz arising  from the left first lumbar segmental artery. Excision of pseudotumor was successfully carried out with additional spinal stabilization. At 2 years  followup, there was no recurrence and the patient was well stabilized with a  satisfactory functional status. Surgical excision gives satisfactory outcome in  such cases.  ,  Context: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia. We present the case  of a male toddler with moderate hemophilia A and cranial hemophilic pseudotumor  managed with factor VIII infusions. We also provide a review of the literature.  Recognition of this rare manifestation of this complication of hemophilia is  important to provide correct treatment and avoid unnecessary investigations,  particularly biopsy, which is contraindicated in this condition.  ,  Context: Bleeding diatheses are a hallmark of hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumor results  from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones or soft tissue spaces. It is  uncommon and is seen in severe cases of hemophilia only 1-2% of the time.  Complications and symptoms arise due to pain and/or compression of surrounding  structures. Pathologic fractures can be associated with intraosseous lesions and  can result from bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of an osseous hemorrhage. Radiographs may demonstrate expansile lesions of the bones  or increased soft tissue density that may be associated with extra osseous  lesions. Bleeding may also occur within the joint space. These intra-articular hemorrhages can, over time, result in hemophilic arthropathy.

Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?,"Yes, STAT3 is a known mTORC1-regulated transcription factor. mTORC1 mediates IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Additionally"," Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis. Reactivation of mTORC1 activity by amino  acids had a positive therapeutic effect in mTORC1-deficient Rheb(+/-) mice.  Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal  epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for  cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling  critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of  inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. As mTORC1 is an important therapeutic  target for multiple diseases, our findings will have important implications for the clinical usage of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with acute inflammatory  bowel disease.  ,  Context: mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis,  lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that  mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2  diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in  the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Over the last years, several groups  observed that mTORC1 inhibition, in addition to reducing protein synthesis,  deeply affects gene transcription. Here, we review the connections between  mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the  activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARÎ³, PPARÎ±, HIF1Î±, YY1âPGC1Î± and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these  transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular  processes in physiological and pathological contexts.  ,  Context: incompletely understood. We investigated whether activation of AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK) prevents the hepatic insulin resistance that is induced by  the consumption of a high-protein diet (HPD) and the presence of excess amino  acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK  phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the  insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor  substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced  insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy  and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1  expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of  transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling.  Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1  signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either  ,  Context: Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), caused  by loss or inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 protein complex, leads to negative feedback  inhibition of Akt. The exact mechanisms of this process are still not fully  understood. Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known  mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process. We demonstrate that  STAT3 promotes the transcription of PTEN by directly binding on the PTEN promoter. Elevated PTEN then inhibits the proliferation of Tsc1(-/-) or  Tsc2(-/-) cells through down-regulation of Akt signaling. Activation of PTEN in  this pathway may thus serve as a protective mechanism against hyper-activated mTORC1 mediated tumorigenesis and contribute to the benign nature of tumors  caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2.  ,  Context: target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely  to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces  HIF-1Î± protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal  cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1Î± protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1Î± mRNA, a  process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that  STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1Î± mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1Î± synthesis on a  translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor  4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1Î± degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives  HIF-1Î± synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.  Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1Î± protein levels and VEGF-A  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant  disorder characterized by widespread benign tumor formation in a variety of  organs. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible  for TSC. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, also known as hamartin and tuberin,  respectively, form a physical and functional complex and inhibit the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The mTORC1 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth promoting pathway. mTORC1 plays an essential  role in a wide array of cellular processes including translation, transcription,  trafficking and autophagy.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. SalomÃ³n Hakim first  identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in BogotÃ¡,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold.  METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature. RESULTS: Professor Hakim first published his thesis in 1964 and 6 case reports  of NPH in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the  Neurological Sciences in 1965. Hakim rose to the forefront of academic medicine as he described a newfound ability to reverse symptoms of ""neurodegeneration""  that had long been considered irreversible. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn more about NPH, the fascinating story of Professor  ,  Context: Although it is debated whether chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency  (CCSVI) plays a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) development, many patients  undergo endovascular treatment (ET) of CCSVI. A study is ongoing in Italy to  evaluate the clinical outcome of ET. Severe adverse events (AEs) occurred in  15/462 subjects at a variable interval after ET: jugular thrombosis in seven  patients, tetraventricular hydrocephalus, stroke, paroxysmal atrial  fibrillation, status epilepticus, aspiration pneumonia, hypertension with  tachicardia, or bleeding of bedsore in the remaining seven cases. One patient  died because of myocardial infarction 10 weeks after ET. The risk of severe AEs related to ET for CCSVI must be carefully considered.  ,  Context:  Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is characterized by an elevation of the  intracranial pressure not associated with an intracranial process or  hydrocephaly, and with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents. The elevation of the intracranial pressure is isolated; therefore, diseases such as cerebral  venous thrombosis or dural fistulas should not be considered as etiologies of  BIH. The exact definition of BIH remains debated, and other terms such as ""pseudotumor cerebri"" or ""idiopathic intracranial hypertension"" are often used  in the literature. Although we agree that BIH is usually not a so benign  disease, we suggest that BIH is still the most appropriate term to describe this  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.  ,  Context: Pseudotumor cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension is a syndrome of raised  intracranial pressure without obvious explanation. Most patients are obese women  at childbearing age. Symptoms and signs usually include headache, nausea,  vomiting, edema of the papilla, visual obscurations and rarely palsy of the  nervus abducens. The prognosis is generally good, but progressive visual loss  and eventual blindness are major risks. We report the case of a 21-year-old  non-obese young woman who developed pseudotumor cerebri while taking minocycline  for acne therapy. Identical symptoms occurred upon inadvert rechallenge with  minocycline for the second time.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

Is there alternative polyadenylation during zebrafish development?,"Yes, alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) occurs in zebrafish development. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads showed that mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with"," Context:  The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs. We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and  tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially  increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish.  mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more  than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages.  ,  Context: to the identification of putative clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of this  gene family. By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we  have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group  of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone  modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to  be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation.  Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental  dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the  roles of these genes during development.  ,  Context: degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence  at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: in expression patterns in zebrafish equivalent to those in mouse, establishing  zebrafish as a suitable model for large-scale testing of human developmental  enhancers.

HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting  that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise  complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes.  ,  Context: model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control  the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating  the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter.  Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish  oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for  normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA  repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small  molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA.  ,  Context: Hox clusters because of an additional ""teleost-specific"" genome duplication  event. By sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole  genome, here we provide evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese  lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This suggests that the lamprey lineage has  experienced an additional genome duplication after 1R and 2R. The relative age  of lamprey and human paralogs supports this hypothesis. Compared with  gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are unusually large. Several  conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the Hox clusters of  lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in individual  lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in  elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the  first two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the  lamprey and gnathostome lineages.

List genes that have been found mutated in CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A).,"PMP22 gene has been found to be mutated in CMT1A. Specifically, the T118M mutation in PMP22 is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A (CMT1A)."," Context: The T118M mutation in PMP22 gene is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, type 1A  (CMT1A). CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related  disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the  stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked structural variation between the wild type and the mutant protein structures.  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy signified by a distal symmetric  polyneuropathy. The most frequent subtype is type 1A (CMT1A) caused by duplication in chromosome 17p12 that includes PMP22. This study reports a woman  with a family history of CMT1A due to PMP22 duplication. However, she presented  with a more severe phenotype than her sibling or ancestors and was found to have a PMP22 triplication instead of the duplication. This was caused by de novo  mutation on her affected mother's duplication chromosome. Her lower limb  magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe diffused atrophy and fatty  ,  Context: Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth  neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal  dominant centronuclear myopathy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the  disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type  B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated  with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used  tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral  nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear  myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant  centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral  ,  Context: Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene  cause either autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type  4A or autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with vocal cord  paresis. We sequenced the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein  1 gene in 138 patients from 119 unrelated families diagnosed with either  demyelinating or axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We  detected six distinct mutant alleles in four families, four of which are novel.  Electrophysiological studies show severely slowed motor nerve conduction  velocities with severely reduced compound muscle action potentials. However, one patient had a normal conduction velocity in the ulnar nerve. Based on the  electrophysiological tests, patients with ganglioside-induced  differentiation-associated protein 1 mutations will therefore be classified as either axonal or demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The  neuropathological aspect shows a divergent pattern; nerve biopsies taken from  two siblings at the same age and sharing the same ganglioside-induced  ,  Context: three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.  ,  Context: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) constitutes a large group of genetically  heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast  majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1  (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family with CMT. To ascertain the Amish CMT locus, we performed a genome-wide single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis on one of three patients from a  consanguineous pedigree. Assuming mutation homogeneity, the analysis sought large homozygous SNP blocks that also contained known CMT loci.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,Avapritinib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop mutants.," Context: Avapritinib (AYVAKITâ¢) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of  platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and KIT activation loop  mutants. It is being developed by Blueprint Medicines for the treatment of  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), solid tumours and systemic  mastocytosis. Avapritinib is approved in the USA for PDGFRA exon 18 (including  D842V) mutant GIST and is undergoing regulatory assessment in the USA as a  4th-line treatment for GIST. Avapritinib is also undergoing regulatory  assessment in the EU for PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST. This article summarizes the  milestones in the development of avapritinib leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA  exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Clinical development of  avapritinib is also underway for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis and late-stage solid tumours in several countries.  ,  Context: avapritinib 300âmg/daily for central nervous system (CNS), lymph-nodal, right  adrenal gland, lung, and subcutaneous metastases. Best response was partial  remission, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Time to treatment progression was  11âmonths. Main toxicities were gradeâ2 cutaneous vasculitis that required  avapritinib discontinuation, and grade 2 uveitis of unknown origin, treated by  vitrectomy and empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy due to negative cultural  tests. Uveitis was detected at the time of progression and therapy was  definitively discontinued. In conclusion, avapritinib proved to be effective  even in the presence of a pretreated disease, a high tumor burden, and brain metastases. In our experience, treatment was feasible and toxicity manageable.  Considering the lack of effective therapies and the poor outcome of the disease,  determination of c-KIT mutations should be performed routinely in cases of metastatic mucosal melanoma.  ,  Context: Avapritinib is a protein kinase inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit  oncogenic KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutants  by targeting the active conformation of the kinase. On 24 September 2020, a  marketing authorisation valid through the European Union was issued for  avapritinib as treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation.  The drug was evaluated in an open-label, phase I, first-in-human,  dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of avapritinib in adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The benefit of avapritinib was observed in  patients with GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. The overall response  rate was 95% (95% confidence interval 82.3%-99.4%), with a median duration of response of 22.1 months (95% confidence interval 14.1-not estimable months). The  most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anaemia, periorbital and face  oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, increased lacrimation, and  ,  Context:  Avapritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has recently received Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic or  unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Mutations in the activation  loop of PDGFRA or KIT confer resistance to conventional TKIs due to structural  changes in the receptor. Avapritinib was developed to selectively target these mutations, thereby offering a new treatment option for patients in whom  imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have failed. This review covers the basic  science and preclinical studies that guided avapritinib's development, in  ,  Context: relevance of these tests remains conflictive. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: in this review, the authors aim to summarize the  new data regarding the relationship between the pharmacology of thiopurines and  pathogenesis of adverse events.  WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: readers will gain an understanding of the metabolism  of thiopurines, side effect profile, pharmacological background of side effects,  importance of metabolite monitoring, clinical relevance of inherited differences  in drug metabolism and other conditions (e.g., concomitant use of allopurinol)  which can modify enzyme activity. By gaining an understanding of the  pharmacology and metabolism of thiopurines, clinicians will be able to optimize thiopurine therapy in IBD. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: TPMT testing and metabolite monitoring are still not  considered the standard of care, and clinicians will continue to choose the approach that best suits their clinical practice and patient needs. Regardless  of what strategy is chosen, patients need to be carefully monitored and well  informed about the potential risks.  ,  Context: RESULTS: In all models, avapritinib resulted in reduction of tumor volume,  significant inhibition of proliferation, and reduced KIT signaling. In two  models, avapritinib led to remarkable histologic responses, increase in  apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation. Avapritinib showed superior  (UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 and -GIST2B KIT 9 ) or equal (UZLX-GIST3 KIT 11 )  antitumor activity to the standard dose of imatinib. In UZLX-GIST9 KIT 11+17 ,  the antitumor effects of avapritinib were significantly better than with  imatinib or regorafenib.

What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges. They also play a crucial role in fine"," Context:  Circular RNA (or circRNA) is a type of single-stranded covalently closed  circular RNA molecule and play important roles in diverse biological pathways. A  comprehensive functionally annotated circRNA database will help to understand the circRNAs and their functions. CircFunBase is such a web-accessible database  that aims to provide a high-quality functional circRNA resource including  experimentally validated and computationally predicted functions. CircFunBase provides visualized circRNA-miRNA interaction networks. In addition, a genome  browser is provided to visualize the genome context of circRNA. In this chapter,  we illustrate examples of searching for circRNA and getting detailed information  ,  Context: MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in the initiation  and progression of many tumors. Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs  (circRNAs) have been described in eukaryotic cells:;they comprise a new class of  gene regulators. Naturally occurring circular miR sponges, which induce miR  loss-of-function, can prevent endogenous onco-miRs from binding to their cognate  mRNA targets. These findings suggest that synthetic (artificial) circular RNAs could be constructed as therapeutic molecular sponges to suppress harmful  onco-miRs. Using enzymatic ligation, we designed and constructed a circular RNA  containing both miR-21 and miR-93 binding sites. The synthetic circular sponge was resistant to digestion with RNase R. Luciferase assays and functional  experiments showed that the circular multi-miR sponge was more stable than its  linear counterpart. Moreover, endogenous miR-21 and miR-93 were inhibited by the  ,  Context: ""backsplicing,"" wherein a downstream 5' splice site (splice donor) is joined to  an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor). Circular RNAs have unique  properties including the potential for rolling circle amplification of RNA, the  ability to rearrange the order of genomic information, protection from  exonucleases, and constraints on RNA folding. Circular RNAs can function as  templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing  reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA  sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and  metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.  ,  Context:  Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene  expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic  locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning  the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the  miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the  potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two  different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated  ,  Context:  Long non-coding RNAs are 200 nucleotide long RNA molecules which lack or have  limited protein-coding potential. They can regulate protein formation through  several different mechanisms. Similarly, circular RNAs are reported to play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are used in various fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology for ultrafast studies. They are also used in x-ray crystallography to determine phase information and reveal the structure of single"," Context: The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry,  and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge  in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials covering the soft x-ray photon energy range from 500eV to 2000eV and outline the  use of this technique to establish and characterize temporal synchronization of  the optical-laser and FEL x-ray pulses.  ,  Context: of these complementary experimental approaches when seeking to understand  protein conformational dynamics. These methods are illustrated using a limited  set of examples including myoglobin and haemoglobin in complex with carbon  monoxide, the simple light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, and the  superoxide scavenger superoxide reductase. In conclusion, likely future  developments of these methods at synchrotron X-ray sources and the potential  impact of emerging X-ray free-electron laser facilities are speculated upon.  ,  Context:  The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  ,  Context: theory has been applied to tackle the problem. This method explicitly accounts  for the laser field and thus does not impose any constraint on the interaction  between the laser pulse and the cluster. We focus on the effects of energetic  changes in the system under high-intensity soft X-ray laser pulses. The motions  of the ions and their velocities during this process show significant  differences for the three applied laser intensities (10(14), 10(15) and 10(16) W  cm(-2)). Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short  to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the  principle of collect and destroy.  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser. Using an imprint technique, we measured the  ,  Context: requiring a decision-making process that can be even more difficult for those  new to the field.

Where possible we also highlight areas that  we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray  free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane  protein structural biology community.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain, involving forebrain and facial malformations that can range from mild to severe. It is also described as the most common malformation of the"," Context: Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically  results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial  anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is heterogeneous and may be caused by chromosome  aberrations or environmental factors, occur in the context of a syndrome or be  due to heterozygous mutations in over 10 identified genes. The presence of these  mutations may result in an extremely wide spectrum of severity, ranging from  brain malformations incompatible with life to individuals with normal brain  findings and subtle midline facial differences. Typically, clinicians regard  intellectual disability as a sign that a parent or relative of a severely affected patient may be a mildly affected mutation 'carrier' with what is termed  microform holoprosencephaly. Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Holoprosencephaly is a rare developmental brain  abnormality with a range of severity. We describe our experience in diagnosing  holoprosencephaly in the fetus with in utero MR imaging. We hypothesized that  including in utero MR imaging in the diagnostic pathway will improve the  detection of holoprosencephaly compared with ultrasonography and allow better  assessment of the severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on holoprosencephaly identified from ultrasonography and/or a diagnosis of holoprosencephaly made with in utero MR  imaging. We compare the diagnoses made with sonography and in utero MR imaging  in each case and compare the 2 methods of assessing the severity of  holoprosencephaly. RESULTS: Thirty-five fetuses are reported, including 9 in which the diagnosis of  holoprosencephaly was made on ultrasonography but not confirmed on in utero MR  imaging. Of the 26 cases of holoprosencephaly diagnosed on in utero MR imaging,  ,  Context: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare mental retardation-multiple congenital  anomalies syndrome associated with typical facial dysmorphism. Patients can show  a variety of other anomalies like short stature, microcephaly, Hirschsprung  disease, malformations of the brain, seizures, congenital heart defects and  urogenital anomalies. Mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of the ZFHX1B gene  have been described as the underlying cause of this condition. We report on the clinical findings in a 2(1/2)-year-old boy with some aspects out of the  MWS-spectrum in addition to unusual anomalies and a novel missense mutation in  the ZFHX1B gene.  ,  Context: Blepharospasm (BSP) is a rather distressing form of focal dystonia. Although  many aspects of its pathophysiological mechanisms are already known, we lack  fundamental evidence on etiology, prevention, and treatment. To advance in our  knowledge, we need to review what is already known in various aspects of the  disorder and use these bases to find future lines of interest. Some of the signs  observed in BSP are cause, while others are consequence of the disorder.  Non-motor symptoms and signs may be a cue for understanding better the disease.  Various cerebral sites have been shown to be functionally abnormal in BSP,  including the basal ganglia, the cortex, and the cerebellum. However, we still do not know if the dysfunction or structural change affecting these brain  regions is cause or consequence of BSP. Further advances in neurophysiology and  neuroimaging may eventually clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated. In this manuscript, we aim to update what is known regarding  epidemiology, clinical aspects, and pathophysiology of the disorder and  speculate on the directions of research worth pursuing in the near future.  ,  Context: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation encompasses a heterogeneous group  of rare neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by iron accumulation  in the brain. Severe generalized dystonia is frequently a prominent symptom and  can be very disabling, causing gait impairment, difficulty with speech and  swallowing, pain and respiratory distress. Several case reports and one case  series have been published concerning therapeutic outcome of pallidal deep brain stimulation in dystonia caused by neurodegeneration with brain iron  degeneration, reporting mostly favourable outcomes. However, with case studies,  there may be a reporting bias towards favourable outcome. Thus, we undertook this multi-centre retrospective study to gather worldwide experiences with  bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation in patients with neurodegeneration  with brain iron accumulation.

The ligamentum teres  sign was seen in 16 of 30 (53%) patients with upper GI tract perforation and in  2 of 23 (8%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p=.008). Multivariate  logistic regression analysis showed that the PPFA sign was the only variable,  which adjusted odds ratio of 15.5 (p=.002). CONCLUSION: The PPFA sign is a useful finding which can help to distinguish  upper from lower GI tract perforation. When this sign is present, upper GI tract  perforation is strongly suggested.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse  small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be  ,  Context: Duodenal pseudomelanosis (or pseudomelanosis duodeni) is a rare benign condition  characterized by black-brown speckled pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa.  Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,TRalpha2 regulates HCN4 gene expression in the heart.," Context: inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild  morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.  ,  Context: and functional significance of thyroid receptor isoforms responsible for HCN  gene transactivation, we generated transgenic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with  adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the thyroid receptors alpha1 (TR alpha 1)  and beta1 (TR beta 1), and analyzed native I(f) current and expression levels of  the underlying molecular components HCN2 and HCN4. Initial results revealed that  spontaneous beating activity was higher in TR alpha 1- and lower in TR beta  1-expressing cardiomyocytes. This was associated with accelerated depolarization  velocity and abbreviated action potential duration in cells overexpressing TR  alpha 1, while TR beta 1 suppressed phase 4 depolarization and prolonged action potentials. Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f)  current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels. In  contrast, HCN2 gene expression was not significantly affected by TR beta 1. TR beta 1 exclusively suppressed HCN4 transcription. T3 application led to  significant effects only in controls and TR alpha 1-infected cardiomyocytes;  whereas, no ligand-dependent actions were observed in TR beta 1-expressing  ,  Context: cardiomyocytes caused marked repression of triiodothyronine (T3)-responsive  genes, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum  calcium-activated adenosinetriphosphatase SERCA2. Treatment with T3 for 4 h  resulted in significant reductions of PKC alpha in nuclear and cytosolic  compartments, and decreased TR alpha1 mRNA and protein, with normalization of  phenotype. These results implicate PKC alpha as a regulator of TR function and  suggest that nuclear localization of PKC alpha may control transcription of the  TR alpha gene, and consequently, affect cardiac phenotype.  ,  Context: thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding  globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the  hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an  energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion  transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as  MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it  binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two  major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta).  The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic  rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The  affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical  characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to  understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their  ,  Context: induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: The present study investigated whether changes in thyroid hormone (TH)  signalling can occur after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with possible  physiological consequences on myocardial performance. TH may regulate several  genes encoding important structural and regulatory proteins particularly through  the TR alpha 1 receptor which is predominant in the myocardium. AMI was induced  in rats by ligating the left coronary artery while sham-operated animals served as controls. This resulted in impaired cardiac function in AMI animals after 2  and 13 weeks accompanied by a shift in myosin isoforms expression towards a  fetal phenotype in the non-infarcted area. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident in AMI hearts after 13 weeks but not at 2 weeks. This response was associated with  a differential pattern of TH changes at 2 and 13 weeks; T(3) and T(4) levels in  plasma were not changed at 2 weeks but T(3) was significantly lower and T(4)  ","11731613, 19629520, 16155104, 23926648, 15831522, 17389455","ARB1, ARB2, TAK1, p38, TRalpha1","18031713, 15831522, 11731613",,,,

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized condition in which  children with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection present with a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan involvement, and elevated  inflammatory markers. These symptoms and the associated laboratory values  strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII  molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs).

We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed  with this hyperinflammatory condition. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with  MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing  MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors  ,  Context: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading worldwide since  December 2019. Hundreds of cases of children and adolescents with Kawasaki  disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of  ","34880708, 33679227, 32511374, 32923992, 33445833","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).

Has ubrogepant entered clinical phase III trials?,"Yes, ubrogepant has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine medication."," Context: INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder involving neurogenic  inflammation and transmission of trigeminovascular nociceptive pathways mediated  by Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Several small molecules antagonizing  the CGRP receptor have been developed as migraine-specific acute medications.  The CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant, also known as MK-1602, has been  recently evaluated in phase III clinical trials for clinical efficacy and  long-term safety as an abortive migraine treatment. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of ubrogepant for the acute  treatment of migraine with or without aura. EXPERT OPINION: Ubrogepant, a selective CGRP antagonist belonging to the gepants  family, has been evaluated in large short- and long-term Phases 2 and 3 clinical  trials aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety as acute migraine medication. It did not significantly affect liver function and was not  associated with other serious adverse events. Long-term non-serious adverse  events were similar between placebo and ubrogepant. The efficacy was evaluated  ,  Context: safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy  participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial,  healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.  Ubrogepant was dosed at 100âmg (2âÃâ50âmg tablets) on 2 consecutive days  followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary  outcome measures were safety and tolerability.  RESULTS: Of participants randomized (nâ=â518), 516 were included in the safety  population (nâ=â260 placebo; nâ=â256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse  events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of  alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levelsââ¥â3âÃâthe  upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to treatment. Four  cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases (one placebo, one  ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one (ubrogepant) probably related.  ,  Context:  Ubrogepant (Ubrelvyâ¢) is an orally administered, small molecule,  highly-selective, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist that was  developed by Allergan under license to Merck & Co. as an acute treatment for migraine. In December 2019, ubrogepant received its first global approval in the  USA for the acute treatment of migraine (Â±âaura) in adults. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ubrogepant leading to its first global approval for the acute treatment of migraine (Â±âaura) in adults.  ,  Context: Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, New Jersey) has recently published an integrated  strategy for implementation of dried blood spots (DBS) in late-stage trials for  population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. We applied this strategy for another  late-stage clinical program: ubrogepant (MK-1602), a novel oral calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for acute treatment of migraine. At the  time of implementation, ubrogepant was entering phase 2 development. DBS was  implemented to acquire PK information proximal to an acute migraine event to  enable exposure-response modeling. The clinical endpoint was a spontaneous  event, which generally occurs outside a clinic visit. Thus, an innovative feature of this trial was facilitating DBS in an outpatient setting. In vitro  and bioanalytical tests established initial method feasibility and suitability  for further evaluations in the clinic. A quantitative relationship was developed between blood and plasma concentrations from concurrently collected samples in a  phase 1 (healthy subjects) and phase 2 (target patient population) study using  graphical and population PK approaches. This integrated information was  ,  Context: METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 834 participants  to treat one migraine attack with ubrogepant 1âmg, 10âmg, 25âmg, 50âmg, 100âmg,  or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and  headache response at two hours. The first primary hypothesis tested the  dose-response trend for two-hour pain freedom using a logistic regression model.  Subsequent hypotheses tested the effects of each dose on the co-primary  endpoints, using a closed sequential testing procedure to control for  multiplicity. RESULTS: A total of 527 participants received ubrogepant and 113 received  placebo. A positive response trend in the proportion of participants achieving two-hour pain freedom was demonstrated (pâ<â0.001). Ubrogepant 100âmg was  significantly superior to placebo for two-hour pain freedom (25.5% vs 8.9%) but  not for two-hour headache response. Per the prespecified multiplicity strategy, this nonsignificant result precluded further formal hypothesis testing, although  the 50âmg and 25âmg doses demonstrated nominal significance over placebo for  two-hour pain freedom (unadjusted pâ<â0.05).

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"Based on the provided information, the deadliest viruses mentioned are:  1. Influenza virus (estimated 50-100 million deaths in 1918-1919) 2. HIV-1 (responsible for a significant number of deaths annually"," Context: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.  In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza appeared nearly simultaneously around the globe  and caused extraordinary mortality (an estimated 50-100 million deaths)  associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The  descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they  cause significant mortality each year. Although the ability to predict influenza  pandemics remains no better than it was a century ago, numerous scientific  advances provide an important head start in limiting severe disease and death  from both current and future influenza viruses: identification and substantial characterization of the natural history and pathogenesis of the 1918 causative  virus itself, as well as hundreds of its viral descendants; development of  moderately effective vaccines; improved diagnosis and treatment of influenza-associated pneumonia; and effective prevention and control measures.  Remaining challenges include development of vaccines eliciting significantly  broader protection (against antigenically different influenza viruses) that can  ,  Context: RESULTS: In August 1998 the Food and Drug Administration in the United States  approved the licensure of a rotavirus vaccine. Both the Advisory Committee of  Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics are likely to  recommend that the vaccine be given to all children by mouth as a series of  three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The vaccine is made by combining a  simian rotavirus strain (RRV) with several human strains representing different  rotavirus serotypes. An understanding of the biology, immunology, and virology  of rotavirus will help to explain the strengths and limitations of the rotavirus  vaccine. CONCLUSION: If used as recommended, the rotavirus vaccine should cause a significant decrease in the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and office  visits of children infected with rotavirus.  ,  Context: 112 IFNAR knockout mice (bred with deletion of genes encoding interferon-Î± and  interferon-Î² receptors) (92%) that were challenged with a lethal dose of  ZIKV-PR209 strain; none of the mice receiving baseline serum survived the  challenge.

Control of ZIKV infection by vaccination or  antiviral drug either from modern, complementary and alternative medicines may  be considered to be one of the most effective strategies in the long run. Large  scale immunization of susceptible human population is highly required to prevent  this deadly disease. Attempts should be made as soon as possible to develop  effective vaccines or antiviral to prevent ZIKV infection. This article provides  a current overview of the experimental therapeutics and treatment options based on modern, complementary and alternative medicines.  ,  Context:  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the deadliest form of malaria, and  human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are among the most important health  problems worldwide, being responsible for a total of 4 million deaths annually. Due to their extensive overlap in developing regions, especially Sub-Saharan  Africa, co-infections with malaria and HIV-1 are common, but the interplay  between the two diseases is poorly understood. Epidemiological reports have suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and  increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² receptors. It is a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein that neutralizes both IL-1Î± and IL-1Î².," Context: severity. CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of  interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of  function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is  supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1Î² blockade in these conditions.  Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug  Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome  and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for  longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in  disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept  in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept  is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring  weekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders  may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for  ,  Context: have completely revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory conditions. These  agents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic  diseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process.  Cytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They  include agents that act against tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFâÎ±) (etanercept,  infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL)  6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), ILâ1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept),  ILâ17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors.  Lymphocyteâtargeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B cells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation  modulator. tsDMARDs, also known as smallâmolecule inhibitors, are oral drugs  based on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4  inhibitors (apremilast) form this group. The major concern with the use of  bDMARDs and tsDMARDs is a higher risk of infections. Performance of blood tests  ,  Context: inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1Î²  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10â061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1Î± and IL-1Î², has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.  ,  Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1Ã antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1Î± and IL-1Ã blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1Ã affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context: consequences, whilst up to 20% of CINCA/NOMID patients die from various  complications, before reaching the early adulthood. In some CINCA/NOMID adult  survivors amyloidosis can also occur. Prior to the discovery of the CIAS1 gene  mutations and the advent of IL-1 targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at  suppressing inflammation, with limited success. The selective blockade of  IL-1beta, with anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), not only provided supportive  evidence for the role of IL-1beta in CAPS, but also demonstrated the efficacy of  targeting IL-1beta for treatment of these conditions. In February, 2008, 'Orphan  Drug' approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst(), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc) was given for the treatment of  two CAPS disorders, FCAS and MWS in adults and children 12 years and older,  making rilonacept the first therapy approved for the treatment of CAPS.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"Î±-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation. Additionally, MEC-17 is"," Context: Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell  morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and  formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial  for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity,  learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of Î±-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  ,  Context: and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated Î±-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (Î±TAT1), an enzyme which acetylates  Lys-40 in Î±-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  Î±TAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-Î²-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-Î² stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via Î±TAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context: Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL)  family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the Î²-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of Î±- and Î²-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the microtubule and position itself for Î²-tail modification. Furthermore, we  demonstrate that all single-chain TTLLs with known glutamylase activity utilize  a cationic microtubule-binding domain analogous to that of TTLL7. Therefore, our  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  Î±-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on Î±-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  Î±-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  Î±-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated Î±-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of Î±-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting Î±-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context:  In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational  glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function. The glutamyl side  chains form as branches of the primary sequence glutamic acids in two biochemically distinct steps: initiation and elongation. The length of the  glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific. Here,  we probe the significance of the glutamyl side chain length regulation in vivo by overexpressing a potent side chain elongase enzyme, Ttll6Ap, in Tetrahymena.  Overexpression of Ttll6Ap caused hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains on the  tubulin of axonemal, cortical, and cytoplasmic microtubules. Strikingly, in the  ,  Context:  Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase.

FUNDING SOURCE: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and an affiliate of  NovaQuest Capital Management LLC.  ,  Context: Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent  Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the ERG review  of the company's submission, the ERG report and submission and summarises the  NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (December 2015). In the company's  initial submission, the base-case analysis resulted in an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Â£14,683 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)  gained for the sequence including apremilast (positioned before tumour necrosis  factor [TNF]-Î± inhibitors) versus a comparator sequence without apremilast.  However, the ERG considered that the base-case sequence proposed by the company represented a limited set of potentially relevant treatment sequences and  positions for apremilast. The company's base-case results were therefore not a  sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast. The exploratory ERG analyses indicated that apremilast is more effective (i.e.  produces higher health gains) when positioned after TNF-Î± inhibitor therapies.

CLSI disk diffusion  breakpoints characterized 18 (imipenem), 14 (meropenem) and three (ertapenem)  isolates as susceptible. When cards with a single carbapenem were used,  detection failures with VITEK2 were four for imipenem, none for meropenem and  one for ertapenem. Cards containing all three carbapenems had one to two  failures. With ESBL combination disks, 21/31 KPC producers and 2/20 VIM  producers were positive. With VITEK2, no VIM producers and between none and  seven KPC producers were ESBL-positive. All carbapenemase producers were detected with the meropenem MIC ECOFF, or the clinical EUCAST breakpoint for  ertapenem. EUCAST disk diffusion breakpoints for meropenem and ertapenem  detected all carbapenemase producers. VITEK2 had between none and four failures in detecting carbapenemase producers, depending on the antibiotic card.  ,  Context: Pharma Co., Pfizer Japan Inc., and Taisho Toyama Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Eisai  Co., Ltd., AYUMI Pharmaceutical Corporation, speaking fees from AbbVie GK.,  BristolâMyers K.K., Chugai Pharmaceutical Co,.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"TAMs have both pro-tumorigenic and antitumor functions, making them a complex target for cancer therapy. However, strategies to reprogram TAMs towards an antitumor phenotype or exploit their antitumor effector functions have shown"," Context: enhancing antitumor responses. In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: is incomplete, chronic inflammation creates a favorable environment that fuels  carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Conventional cancer therapy also  strengthens cancer-related inflammation by inducing massive tumor cell death  that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype. In line with this high  plasticity, macrophages can be hijacked by cancer cells to support tumor  progression and immune escape, or therapy resistance. Impaired resolution of  cancer-associated inflammation supported by TAMs may thus reinforces tumor progression. From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment. Here, we review SPMs' anticancer capacities with special attention  regarding their effects on TAMs. We further discuss how this new therapeutic  ,  Context: treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting  TAMs with conventional therapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3241-50. Â©2017 AACR.  ,  Context: still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting  strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.  ,  Context: Protein neddylation, a newly characterized posttranslational modification that  adds the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 to substrates, modulates important  biological processes, whereas dysfunction of neddylation may cause several  serious diseases, such as cancer. Inhibition of neddylation pathway has emerged  as a promising anticancer strategy, as evidenced by development of the  NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor MLN4924. Due to its potent anti-cancer  efficacy and well-tolerated toxicity, MLN4924 has been evaluated in multiple  Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Recently,  accumulating evidences indicate that neddylation pathway also plays a pivotal role in the regulation of multiple processes of tumor microenvironment (TME),  such as tumor angiogenesis and the function of immune cells. In this review, we  briefly summarize the latest progresses in this field and highlight neddylation pathway as an attractive therapeutic target against human cancer.

Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"Yes, Gfi1b is essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages in hematopoiesis. It regulates the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and its loss silences"," Context: factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and  definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses  demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive  and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences  markers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b  silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for  definitive hematopoiesis. We determine the epistatic relationships between the  gfi factors and key hematopoietic transcription factors, demonstrating that  gfi1aa and gfi1b join lmo2, scl, runx-1 and c-myb as critical regulators of teleost HSPC. Our studies establish a comparative paradigm for the regulation of  hematopoietic lineages by gfi transcription factors.  ,  Context: cytokines that control both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Gfi1 itself  represses the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation and  differentiation. Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been  implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory  responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of  leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the  development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function  contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of  these proteins.  ,  Context: In the search for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, we identified  that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly  restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Gfi-1  and Gfi-1B are zinc finger proteins that share highly conserved SNAG and 6 zinc  finger domains. Gfi-1 has been characterized as an oncogene involved in lymphoid  malignancies in mice. In contrast, role of Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis has not been well characterized. In this study, we analyzed its function in human  hematopoiesis. Enforced expression of Gfi-1B in human CD34(+) hematopoietic  progenitors induced a drastic expansion of erythroblasts in an erythropoietin-independent manner. Expression of Gfi-1B did not promote  erythroid commitment, but enhanced proliferation of immature erythroblasts.  Erythroblasts expanded by exogenous Gfi-1B, however, failed to differentiate  ,  Context: Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor  essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. To  elucidate the mechanism underlying Gfi1b function, potential downstream  transcriptional targets were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and  expression profiling approaches. The combination of these approaches revealed  the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent  target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple  Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied  by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in the closely related megakaryocyte lineage. Accordingly, Meis1 was significantly  upregulated in LSD1 inhibited erythroid cells, but not in megakaryocytes. This  lineage specific upregulation in Meis1 expression was accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone3 lysine4 levels in the Meis1 promoter in LSD1  inhibited, erythroid cells. Meis1 was also substantially upregulated in gfi1b-/-  fetal liver cells along with its transcriptional partners Pbx1 and several Hox  ,  Context: T-cells, whereas activation in later stages leaves development unaffected. In  Gfi1 deficient multipotent precursors, Notch activation induces lethality and is  cell autonomous. Further, without Gfi1, multipotent progenitors do not maintain  Notch1-activated global expression profiles typical for T-lineage precursors. In  agreement with this, we find that both lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors  (LMPP) and early T lineage progenitors (ETP) do not properly form or function in  Gfi1(-/-) mice. These defects correlate with an inability of Gfi1(-/-)  progenitors to activate lymphoid genes, including IL7R, Rag1, Flt3 and Notch1.  Our data indicate that Gfi1 is required for hematopoietic precursors to withstand Notch1 activation and to maintain Notch1 dependent transcriptional  programming to determine early T-lymphoid lineage identity.  ,  Context: Gfi1 is a transcriptional repressor essential for haematopoiesis and inner ear  development. It shares with its paralogue Gfi1b an amino-terminal SNAG repressor  domain and six carboxy-terminal zinc-finger motifs, but differs from Gfi1b in  sequences separating these domains. Here, we describe two knock-in mouse models,  in which the N-terminal SNAG repressor domain was mutated or in which the Gfi1  coding region was replaced by Gfi1b. Mouse mutants without an intact SNAG domain show the full phenotype of Gfi1 null mice. However, Gfi1:Gfi1b knock-in mice  show almost normal pre-T-cell and neutrophil development, but lack properly  formed inner ear hair cells. Hence, our findings show that an intact SNAG domain is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1  functionally in haematopoiesis but, surprisingly, not in inner ear hair cell  development, demonstrating that Gfi1 and Gfi1b have equivalent and  ","22960038, 20861919, 12351384, 23308270, 24068942, 16397623",Yes. Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.  Gfi-1b(-/-) embryonic stem cells fail to contribute to red cells of adult chimeras.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,Chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules are simultaneously profiled through the NOMe-seq methodology.," Context: methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling  chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Therefore,  there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify  chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq. RESULTS: In this article, we present CAME (Chromatin Accessibility and  Methylation), a seed-extension based approach that identifies chromatin  accessibility from NOMe-seq. The efficiency and effectiveness of CAME were  demonstrated through comparisons with other existing techniques on both  simulated and real data, and the results show that our method not only can precisely identify chromatin accessibility but also outperforms other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/. CONTACTS: jechoi@gru.edu or khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: Gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of  promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers. Several  studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions.  However, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function  to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive. Here, by  exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct  genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene  promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal  genes in their natural loci. Our results have important implications for the  understanding of complex gene regulation in normal development and disease.  ,  Context: complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and  DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced  genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the  acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq  (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated  H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of  constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq  assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug  incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene  reactivation. Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the  demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies, suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers.  ,  Context: Gene expression assays that are used in daily clinical practice for treating  early breast cancer patients have been introduced in the clinic only recently.  This review discusses the development of these arrays, summarizes the validation  of those that are commercially available and indicates how the information  provided by these assays can help in the care of patients. The review also  provides an extensive overview of commercially available assays focusing on MammaPrint, the first and only assay for breast cancer management that has been  cleared by the FDA.  ,  Context: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development and  progression of periodontal disease. Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies. We have developed a system for efficient  transposon mutagenesis of P. gingivalis using a modified mariner transposon.  Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome  junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using  Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the  library was produced. Identification of fitness of individual mutants under  specific conditions can be performed by exposing the library to selective  pressures.  ,  Context:  Botulinum neurotoxins are one of the most potent toxins known to man. Current  methods of detection involve the quantification of the toxin but do not take  into account the percentage of the toxin that is active. At present the assay used for monitoring the activity of the toxin is the mouse bioassay, which is  lengthy and has ethical issues due to the use of live animals. This report  demonstrates a novel assay that utilises the endopeptidase activity of the toxin to detect Botulinum neurotoxin in a pharmaceutical sample.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with an increased risk of breast cancer. A higher 2D:4D ratio is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, while a lower 2D:4D ratio is associated"," Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels. METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524  prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2Dâ:â4D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2Dâ:â4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSION: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer  risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.  ,  Context: gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between 2nd to 4th digit ratio  (digit ratio) and prostate cancer detection rate and biopsy findings, including  Gleason score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 770 consecutive men aged 40 years or older that  presented with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), right hand 2nd and 4th digit  lengths were measured prior to PSA determinations, DRE and transrectal  ultrasonography (TRUS). Among these, 166 men with a prostate specific antigen  (PSA) level â¥ 3 ng/mL or abnormal digit rectal examination (DRE) prospectively  underwent prostate biopsies. The relationship between digit ratio and prostate  cancer detection rate and biopsy findings was investigated. RESULTS: The study subjects were allocated to two groups by digit ratio (group  A: digit ratio < 0.95; n = 420; group B: digit ratio â¥ 0.95; n = 350). Despite  similar biopsy rates (22.4% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.544), group A had higher cancer detection rate (46.8% (44/94) vs. 23.6% (17/72), p = 0.002; OR = 2.847, 95% CI =  1.445-5.610).

RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P â¤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess whether 2D:4D measures are associated with breast  cancer risk. METHODS: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers  (2D:4D), and right minus left 2D:4D (Î(r-l)) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants' hands collected during a recent follow-up of the  Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469  women.

Which IDH inhibitors by Agios Pharmaceuticals have been approved by the FDA?,"Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor) and ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018, respectively."," Context: accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20%  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140,  and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In  recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy can overlap with dilated cardiomyopathy. Features of LV noncompaction can also overlap with dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, mutations in the betaMHC gene have been found to cause both isolated LV"," Context: BACKGROUND: Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder caused by the  arrest of myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, leading to a non compacted  endocardial layer with marked hypertrabeculation and deep recesses.  AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of  15 adult patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 Â± 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and  July 2010. RESULTS: The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope  in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 Â± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 Â±  10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved  in all the cases. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 40%o. The average  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM). BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype. In  addition, INLVM with a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle, ventricular  dysfunction, and deep trabeculations, is also inherited, and the genes  ,  Context: Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle (LV) is a rare disorder, classified  as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association. The  European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial  Diseases classified LV noncompaction as an unclassified cardiomyopathy. LV  noncompaction cardiomyopathy characterized by the following features: 1) an  altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular  recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of  compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left  ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity, without evidence of communication with the  epicardial coronary artery system. Features of LV noncompaction can overlap with  dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially the apical variant), and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The phenotypic expression can vary  considerably within the same family. The LV noncompaction can rarely occur as a  transient phenomenon during myocarditis. We present the case of a 23-year-old  ,  Context:  Mutations in the betaMHC (beta-myosin heavy chain), a sarcomeric protein are  responsible for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms  whereby distinct mutations in the betaMHC gene cause two kinds of cardiomyopathy are still unclear. In the present study we report a novel betaMHC mutation found  in a patient with isolated LVNC [LV (left ventricular) non-compaction] and the  phenotype of a mouse mutant model carrying the same mutation. To find the mutation responsible, we searched for genomic mutations in 99 unrelated probands  with dilated cardiomyopathy and five probands with isolated LVNC, and identified  a p.Met531Arg mutation in betaMHC in a 13-year-old girl with isolated LVNC.  ,  Context: the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. The echocardiography  was characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (25 %) due to  isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC).  TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with a combination therapy  including ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. An oral anticoagulation was recommended  as secondary prophylaxis. At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context:  Accumulating data suggest a link between alterations/deficiencies in  cytoskeletal proteins and the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure,  although the molecular basis for this link remains unclear. Cypher/ZASP is a cytoskeletal protein localized in the sarcomeric Z-line. Mutations in its  encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of  the left ventricular myocardium, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase Î¸?,POLQ," Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol Î¸) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol Î¸ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional  insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol Î¸ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These  include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol Î¸ participates in a route of DSB repair termed ""alternative  end-joining"" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex  and requires DNA end resection. Pol Î¸ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. ""Signatures"" of Pol Î¸ action  during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the  insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining  ,  Context: DNA polymerase theta (pol Î¸) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol Î¸ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated  end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian  immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol Î¸ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical  properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures  of pol Î¸ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol Î¸ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual  juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase,  separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize  ,  Context:  Aberrant oxidation is a property of many tumor cells. Oxidation of DNA  precursors, i.e., deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), as well as DNA is a  major cause of genome instability. Here, we report that human DNA polymerase eta (h Poleta) incorporates oxidized dNTPs, i.e., 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine  5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-OH-dGTP), into DNA in an erroneous and efficient manner, thereby inducing various types of mutations during in vitro gap-filling DNA synthesis. When  2-OH-dATP was present at a concentration equal to those of the four normal dNTPs  in the reaction mixture, DNA synthesis by h Poleta enhanced the frequency of  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase Î¸ protects against genomic instability via an alternative  end-joining repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks. Polymerase Î¸ is  overexpressed in breast, lung and oral cancers, and reduction of its activity in mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,  including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the  C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase Î¸, illustrating two potential modes of dimerization.

The polymerase almost exclusively incorporated  8-hydroxy-dGTP (8-OH-dGTP) opposite template adenine (A) at 60% efficiency of normal dTTP incorporation, and incorporated 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP) opposite  template thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C) at substantial rates.

To study how the  Neanderthal private alleles may have spread over the genes of Homo sapiens, we  propose a deterministic model based on recursive equations and ordinary  differential equations. If the Neanderthal population was large compared to the  Homo sapiens population at the beginning of the contact period, we show that  genetic introgression should have been fast and complete meaning that most of  the Neanderthal private alleles should be found in the modern human gene pool in  case of ancient admixture. In order to test/reject ancient admixture from genome-wide data, we incorporate the model of genetic introgression into a  statistical hypothesis-testing framework. We show that the power to reject  ancient admixture increases as the ratio, at the time of putative admixture, of the population size of Homo sapiens over that of Neanderthal decreases. We find  that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the  population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population  size.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by establishing mid-S replication domains, which are restrained from being activated at early S-phase.

Additionally,"," Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Î cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Î cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Î cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.

G4 DNA- and  RNA-binding proteins and unwinding helicases associate with and regulate G4s  during virtually all processes that involve DNA and RNA. DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates  transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We conclude with a discussion of the possible functions of G4s and DHX36 in the  aging brain.  ,  Context: results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC  binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its  G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding  activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity  of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC  plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the  function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure.  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context: Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences challenge the replication, transcription,  and translation machinery by spontaneously folding into G-quadruplexes, the  unfolding of which requires forces greater than most polymerases can exert1,2.  Eukaryotic cells contain numerous helicases that can unfold G-quadruplexes 3 .  The molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of G-quadruplexes by  helicases remains poorly understood. DHX36 (also known as RHAU and G4R1), a member of the DEAH/RHA family of helicases, binds both DNA and RNA  G-quadruplexes with extremely high affinity4-6, is consistently found bound to  G-quadruplexes in cells7,8, and is a major source of G-quadruplex unfolding activity in HeLa cell lysates 6 . DHX36Â is a multi-functional helicase that has  been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and  post-transcriptional regulation, and is essential for heart development,  ,  Context: DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex  structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s.  Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid  DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4 from the 3' end is sufficient to reach the overall transition state for G4  disruption, while the DSM remains unperturbed at the 5' end. Interestingly, the  DSM does not contribute to G4 binding kinetics or thermodynamics at low  ,  Context:  Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing  and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis, and sex determination. It participates in the Notch signalling pathway."," Context: The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with  Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have  isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis.  Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4  was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells  adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells. This distinct pattern of  ,  Context: Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences  results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling  pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho family members is correlated with several neoplastic conditions. Here we focus  on the functions of Groucho proteins during body patterning and their  implication in tumorigenesis.  ,  Context: Operons are primarily a bacterial phenomenon, not commonly observed in  eukaryotes. However, new research indicates that operons are found in higher  organisms as well. There are instances of operons found in C. elegans,  Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic species. We developed a prototype  using positional, structural and gene expression information to identify  candidate operons. We focused our efforts on ""trans-spliced"" operons in which  the pre-mRNA is trans-spliced into individual transcripts and subsequently  translated, as widely observed in C. elegans and some instances in Drosophila.  We identify several candidate operons in Drosophila melanogaster of which two have been subsequently molecularly validated.  ,  Context: We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho  homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears  to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence  for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding  sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein,  followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ  hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous  system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a  conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic  helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also  ,  Context: The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in  Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata.  The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins. Based on these data, a model for Groucho/Tle gene evolution is proposed.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.

Please list the drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia.,"Diuretics, bisphosphonates, antacids, catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, acetazolamide, and imatinib are associated with drug-induced hypophosphatemia"," Context: Hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration <2.5 mg/dl, 0.8 mmol/l),  although rare in the general population, is commonly observed in hospitalized  patients and may be associated with drug therapy. In fact, hypophosphatemia  frequently develops in the course of treatment with drugs used in every-day  clinical practice including diuretics and bisphosphonates. Proper diagnostic  approach of patients with low serum phosphorus concentrations should involve a  detailed medical history with special attention to the recent use of  medications.

No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine rates of psychotropic  medication use and identify associated child and family characteristics among  children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enrolled in an  autism registry maintained by the Autism Treatment Network (ATN). METHODS: The sample, derived from the ATN registry, consists of 2853 children  aged 2 to 17 years with diagnoses of ASD supported by Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the Autism Diagnostic  Observation Schedule with available data on medication use. As part of initial  enrollment in the registry, parents completed questionnaires on current psychotropic medication use, psychiatric and medical conditions, and  demographics. RESULTS: Of the 2853 children, 763 (27%) were taking â¥ 1 psychotropic  medication; 15% were prescribed 1 medication, 7.4% received 2 medications, and 4.5% received â¥ 3. Among children aged 3 to 5 years, 11% were taking â¥ 1  psychotropic medication; among 6- to 11-year-old children, 46%; and 66% of  adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were taking at â¥ 1 psychotropic medication.

He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non  FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be  interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate  intake. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and treating  drug-induced hypophosphatemia in a timely manner, and thus avoid the morbidity  associated with this entity.  ,  Context: Phosphate plays essential roles in many biological processes, and the serum  phosphate level is tightly controlled. Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired  mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia.  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates  phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired  phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired  FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked  hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most  prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another  clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is  ,  Context: Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare  disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia  resulting from renal phosphate wasting. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a  noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone  mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations  in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a  novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a  50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 monomethylation is mediated by PR-Set7, which has been linked to defective S phase progression and accumulation of DNA damage. However, deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation in D"," Context: environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: function are now the subject of active investigation. Although a large number of  methylases capable of methylating H4K20 have been identified and characterized;  there is no known demethylase of H4K20, though the search is ongoing.  Additionally, many recent studies have been directed at understanding the role  of methylated H4K20 and other histone modifications associated with different  biological processes in the context of a combinatorial histone code. It seems  likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely  valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and  during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene  expression.  ,  Context:  DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical  processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common  epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and  nonepigenetic phenomenon. Here we report that the histone deacetylase SIRT1  regulates the activities of DNMT1, a key enzyme responsible for DNA methylation. In mass spectrometry analysis, 12 new acetylated lysine sites were identified in  DNMT1. SIRT1 physically associates with DNMT1 and can deacetylate acetylated  DNMT1 in vitro and in vivo.

Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?,CLCNKB," Context:  Bartter syndrome, a group of disorders that encompasses multiple genetic defects  with similar clinical presentation, has been divided into six different  genotypes, according to different genetic defects, and into three main clinical variants (or phenotypes). Classic laboratory findings in all variants include  hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of  chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome  and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport  channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the  ,  Context: 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with  Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular  disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we  performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with  four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC  gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our  families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker  locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our  families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001). Our data prove that  Gitelman's syndrome is genetically distinct from classic Bartter's syndrome and  hyperprostaglandin E syndrome. It remains unknown if classic Bartter's syndrome and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome are caused by a common genetic defect.  ,  Context:  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to  low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Recently,  investigators have been able to demonstrate mutations of six genes encoding several renal tubular transporters and ion channels that can be held responsible  for Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. Neonatal Bartter's syndrome is caused by  mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK, classic Bartter's syndrome by mutations of ClC-Kb, Bartter's syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness is due to mutations of  BSND, Gitelman's syndrome to mutations of NCCT and Bartter's syndrome associated  with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is linked to mutations of CASR. We review  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Classic Bartter syndrome is a salt-wasting tubulopathy caused by  mutations in the CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb) gene. Although growth hormone  deficiency has been suggested as a cause for persistent growth failure in  patients with classic Bartter syndrome, in our opinion the diagnoses of growth  hormone deficiency has been unconvincing in some reports. Moreover, Gitelman  syndrome seems to have been confused with Bartter syndrome in some cases in the  literature. In the present work, we describe a new case with CLCNKB gene  mutations and review the reported cases of classic Bartter syndrome associated  with growth hormone deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a Japanese boy diagnosed as having classic  Bartter syndrome at eight months of age. The diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was  confirmed by CLCNKB gene analysis, which revealed compound heterozygous mutations with deletion of exons 1 to 3 (derived from his mother) and ÎL130  (derived from his father). His medical therapy consisted of potassium (K),  sodium chloride, spironolactone, and anti-inflammatory agents; this regime was  ,  Context: The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited  tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal  nephron. At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the  underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center.  Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of  classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish  ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the  kindreds. The parents and siblings of each patient, as well as a population of 300 healthy control adult subjects, were also analyzed. All ten patients were  found to be homozygous for an identical missense mutation in the CLCNKB gene,  substituting a threonine for an alanine at codon 204 (A204T) in the putative  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes recent advances in our understanding of  the genetic heterogeneity, pathophysiology and treatment of Bartter syndrome, a  group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle.

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, cephalopods do not use RNA editing less frequently than other species. In fact, recent reports suggest that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites"," Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution. This  ,  Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA  ,  Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens ofÂ thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the largeÂ number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but  their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans  at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a  new computational pipeline with a ""bisulfite-seq-mapping-like"" step and achieved  a threefold increase in identification sensitivity. A total of 99.5% of the  47,660 A-to-I editing sites were found in clusters. Of the 3080 editing  clusters, 65.7% overlapped with DNA transposons in noncoding regions and 73.7%  could form hairpin structures. The numbers of editing sites and clusters were  highest at the L1 and embryonic stages. The editing frequency of a cluster positively correlated with the number of editing sites within it. Intriguingly,  for 80% of the clusters with 10 or more editing sites, almost all expressed  transcripts were edited. Deletion of adr-1 reduced the editing frequency but not the number of editing clusters, whereas deletion of adr-2 nearly abolished RNA  editing, indicating a modulating role of ADR-1 and an essential role of ADR-2 in  A-to-I editing. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that adr-2 mutant worms  ,  Context:  RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there  is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase,  RNA-specific) targets. Here we explore natural genetic variation affecting editing levels of particular sites in 81 natural strains of Drosophila  melanogaster. The analysis of associations between editing levels and  single-nucleotide polymorphisms allows us to map putative cis-regulatory regions affecting editing of 16 A-to-I editing sites (cis-RNA editing quantitative trait  loci or cis-edQTLs, PÂ <Â 10(-8)).

Thus, the tRNA(Tyr) is subjected to an RNA editing activity similar  to that shown to exist in the mitochondria of two other animal species.  Interestingly, some cDNA clones have several adenosine residues at their 3'-ends  instead of the expected CCA-sequence. Furthermore, a review of sequence data  from animal mitochondrial genomes suggests that only tRNAs whose discriminator  bases are adenosines tend to have genes that overlap with downstream genes.  Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery  that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria.

What drugs are included in the Avandamet pill?,Metformin and rosiglitazone.," Context: insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of  hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin  resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell  compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to  secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues. Biguanides and  thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are two unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents  that are the most commonly used medications to improve insulin sensitivity. They  have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms  of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis. Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet  ,  Context: Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with  significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c â¤6.5% was reached  in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) â¤6.1 mmol/L was reached in  26.97% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 19.33% in uptitrated metformin  treatment. The target of FPG â¤7.0 mmol/L was reached in 63.16% of patients in  Avandamet treatment and 43.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. Fasting  insulin decreased 3.24 Â± 0.98 Î¼U/ml from baseline in Avandamet treatment and  0.72 Â± 1.10 Î¼U/ml in uptitrated metformin treatment. Overall adverse event (AE) rates and serious AE rates were similar between groups. Hypoglycaemia occurred  rarely in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with uptitrated metformin, Avandamet treatment provided significant improvements in key parameters of glycemic control and was generally  well tolerated. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-TRC-13003776.  ,  Context: in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by  monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before  maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin  resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Avanafil is a highly selective PDE5 inhibitor that is a  competitive antagonist of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Specifically, avanafil has a high ratio of inhibiting PDE5 as compared with other PDE subtypes allowing  for the drug to be used for ED while minimizing adverse effects. Absorption  occurs quickly following oral administration with a median Tmax of 30 to 45 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 5 hours. Additionally, it is  predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. As such, avanafil should not  be co-administered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors."," Context:  Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation.

An overview of the known function of miRNAs in RA and what the future might hold  for the use of these small RNA molecules in RA diagnosis and treatment is  provided.  ,  Context: scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly  progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well  into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria  is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed  Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal  posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations  found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%).  Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways. Potential  therapeutic strategies are developed along these lines and include RNA interference techniques and inhibition of the dominant-negative influence of  abnormally formed Lamin A on polymerization with normally formed Lamin A.  ,  Context:  U RNAs are highly abundant small nuclear RNAs involved in the processing of  messenger RNA. Most U RNA genes are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase  II (pol II). However, evidence has recently been presented that U6 RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). In the light of these results it  was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene  includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements.

When was Volanesorsen approved in the EU?,Volanesorsen (Waylivra) was approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with FCS in May 2019.," Context:  Volanesorsen (WaylivraÂ®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of  apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals  through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial  lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the  treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the multinational, phaseÂ III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are  ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial  lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of  ,  Context: levels remained significantly lower than at baseline in association with all  inclisiran regimens. Serious adverse events occurred in 11% of the patients who  received inclisiran and in 8% of the patients who received placebo.  Injection-site reactions occurred in 5% of the patients who received injections  of inclisiran. CONCLUSIONS: In our trial, inclisiran was found to lower PCSK9 and LDL  cholesterol levels among patients at high cardiovascular risk who had elevated  LDL cholesterol levels.

We systematically reviewed the literature on the  efficacy and safety of cariprazine. METHODS: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO,  EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through August 31, 2016. The search was not restricted by patient age. Articles published in English or official  English translations were included. RESULTS: Eleven articles that evaluated the use of cariprazine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders were identified. Four trials evaluated the safety and  efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as  an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: The kidney plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and has  been considered a target for therapeutic intervention. The sodium-glucose  cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the  proximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a  unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose  of this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2  inhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms ""SGLT2"" and ""SGLT2  inhibitor"" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an  insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence  of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be  used at any stage of diabetes.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung cancers. Specifically, mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) was detected in"," Context: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and  bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range  of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the  mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and  pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  ,  Context:  Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin  (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including  prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR),  the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN  receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been  used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target  various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro  ,  Context: Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists.  PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific  (125)I-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Î²Ala-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB(6-14) binding to NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells stably transfected with BRS-3 with IC50 values of  4.8 and >100Î¼M, respectively. In contrast, ML-18 bound with lower affinity to  the GRPR and NMBR with IC50 values of 16 and >100Î¼M, respectively. ML-18 (16Î¼M),  ,  Context:  Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides,  has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC),  and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides,  neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung  carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14  of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in  the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE  ,  Context: cell lung cancer, expression without amplification or rearrangement of myc genes  is seen. In contrast, high level expression of p53 is not associated with gene  amplification in any lung cancer type. In addition, to these proto-oncogenes  acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context:  The orphan receptor, bombesin receptor subtype-3(BRS-3) is a G-protein-coupled  receptor classified in the bombesin (Bn) receptor family because of its high  homology (47-51%) with other members of this family [gastrin-releasing peptide receptor [GRPR] and neuromedin B receptor [NMBR]]. There is increasing interest  in BRS-3, because primarily from receptor knockout studies, it seems important  in energy metabolism, glucose control, insulin secretion, motility and tumor growth. Pharmacological tools to study the role of BRS-3 in  physiology/pathophysiology are limited because the natural ligand is unknown and  BRS-3 has low affinity for all naturally occurring Bn-related peptides.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional  selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Species of the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus harbour three replication  origins in their single circular chromosome that are synchronously initiated  during replication.  RESULTS: We demonstrate that global gene expression in two Sulfolobus species is  highly biased, such that early replicating genome regions are more highly  expressed at all three origins. The bias by far exceeds what would be  anticipated by gene dosage effects alone. In addition, early replicating regions  are denser in archaeal core genes (enriched in essential functions), display  lower intergenic distances, and are devoid of mobile genetic elements. CONCLUSION: The strong replication-biased structuring of the Sulfolobus  chromosome implies that the multiple replication origins serve purposes other  than simply shortening the time required for replication. The higher-level chromosomal organisation could be of importance for minimizing the impact of DNA  damage, and may also be linked to transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Primary bacterial endosymbionts of insects (p-endosymbionts) are  thought to be undergoing the process of Muller's ratchet where they accrue  slightly deleterious mutations due to genetic drift in small populations with  negligible recombination rates. If this process were to go unchecked over time,  theory predicts mutational meltdown and eventual extinction. Although genome  degradation is common among p-endosymbionts, we do not observe widespread  p-endosymbiont extinction, suggesting that Muller's ratchet may be slowed or  even stopped over time. For example, selection may act to slow the effects of  Muller's ratchet by removing slightly deleterious mutations before they go to fixation thereby causing a decrease in nucleotide substitutions rates in older  p-endosymbiont lineages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine whether selection is slowing the  effects of Muller's ratchet, we determined the age of the Candidatus Riesia/sucking louse assemblage and analyzed the nucleotide substitution rates  of several p-endosymbiont lineages that differ in the length of time that they  have been associated with their insect hosts. We find that Riesia is the  ,  Context: lubeluzole structure. The obtained experimental results were rationalized by  docking simulation on the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)  structure of hERG. Group efficiency analysis was performed in order to  individuate the fragment most contributing to binding. RESULTS: We found that lubeluzole and its R enantiomer are highly potent  inhibitors of human ether-ago-go-related gene (hERG) channel with an IC50 value  of 12.9 Â± 0.7 nM and 11.3 Â± 0.8 nM, respectively. In the presence of lubeluzole,  steady-state activation and inactivation of hERG channel were shifted to more  negative potentials and inactivation kinetics was accelerated. Mutations of aromatic residues (Y652A and F656A) in the channel inner cavity significantly  reduced the inhibitory effect of lubeluzole. Molecular docking simulations  performed on the near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of hERG supported the role of Y652 and F656 as the main contributors to high  affinity binding. Group efficiency analysis indicated that both  1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine and 3-aryloxy-2-propanolamine moieties contribute to  ,  Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: duplicates returned to single-copy genes shortly after duplication. The  persisting duplicated genes in Saccharomyces led to the origin of major  metabolic innovations, which have been the source of the unique biotechnological  capabilities in the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. What factors have  determined the fate of duplicated genes remains unknown. Here, we report the  first demonstration that the local genome mutation and transcription rates  determine the fate of duplicates. We show, for the first time, a preferential  location of duplicated genes in the mutational and transcriptional hotspots of  S. cerevisiae genome. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates exhibiting different preservation trends compared to small-scale  duplicates. Genome mutational and transcriptional hotspots are rich in  duplicates with large repetitive promoter elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows more tolerance to deleterious mutations in duplicates with repetitive  promoter elements, which in turn exhibit higher transcriptional plasticity  against environmental perturbations.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10."," Context:  Inherited neuropathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. At least 28  genes and 12 loci have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)  and related inherited neuropathies. Most causes of inherited neuropathy have been discovered by positional cloning technique and in the past two years, the  pace of CMT gene discovery has accelerated. Genetic studies have revealed the  following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating  form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal  recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for  ,  Context: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been reported in idiopathic and hereditary forms  of parkinsonism, but the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear and likely  heterogeneous. Levodopa-induced vitamin B12 deficiency has been discussed as a  causal factor of PN in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but peripheral nervous  system involvement might also be a consequence of the underlying  neurodegenerative process. Occurrence of PN with parkinsonism has been associated with a panel of mitochondrial cytopathies, more frequently related to  a nuclear gene defect and mainly polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene. Parkin (PARK2)  gene mutations are responsible for juvenile parkinsonism, and possible peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported. Rarely, an association  of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases  such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous  group of peripheral neuropathies. Different chromosomal loci have been linked  with three autosomal dominant, 'intermediate' types of CMT: DI-CMTA, DI-CMTB and DI-CMTC. We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2  to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia,  Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus.

Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases include a group of clinically heterogeneous  inherited neuropathies subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2) and  intermediate CMT forms. CMTs are associated with different genes, although mutations in some of these genes may cause both clinical pictures. To date, more  than 50 CMT genes have been identified, but more than half of the cases are due  to mutations in MFN2, MPZ, GJB1 and PMP22. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of disease mutationsÂ of these four genes in the axonal form of CMT  in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2  patients.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and prevent development of thyroid cancer years later, particularly in children and adolescents."," Context: It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  ,  Context: from accumulation of unrepaired DNA, and attenuates initiation of inflammation  as well as fibrotic pathways. Interestingly, these properties of metformin can  sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy.  CONCLUSION: In this article, we aimed to review the interesting properties of  metformin such as radioprotection, radiomitigation and radiosensitization, which  could make it an interesting adjuvant for clinical radiotherapy, as well as an  interesting candidate for mitigation of radiation injury after a radiation  disaster.  ,  Context:  Thyroid cancer in children and adolescents has to be considered as the most  severe health consequence of a nuclear reactor emergency with release of  radioiodine into the atmosphere. High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer  years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk  induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the  interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in  existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone directly affects the heart and peripheral vascular system. The  hormone can increase myocardial inotropy and heart rate and dilate peripheral  arteries to increase cardiac output. An excessive deficiency of thyroid hormone  can cause cardiovascular disease and aggravate many preexisting conditions. In  severe systemic illness and after major surgical procedures changes in thyroid  function can occur, leading to the ""euthyroid sick syndrome."" Patients will have  normal or decreased levels of T4, decreased free and total T3, and usually  normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone. This syndrome may be an adaptive  response to systemic illness that usually will revert to normal without hormone supplementation as the illness subsides. Recently, however, many investigators  have explored the benefits of thyroid hormone supplementation in those diseases  associated with euthyroid sick syndrome. Thyroid hormone's effects on the cardiovascular system make it an attractive therapy for those patients with  impaired hemodynamics and low T3. Thyroid hormone has also been considered a  treatment for patients with congestive heart failure, for patients undergoing  ,  Context: strategies in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (three involving a  biomarker or PDD) were each associated with a 20% chance of being considered  cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses the results were most sensitive to the  pretest probability of disease (5% in the base case). CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of PDD's higher sensitivity in detecting bladder  cancer have to be weighed against the disadvantages of a higher false-positive  rate. Taking into account the assumptions made in the model, strategies  involving biomarkers and/or PDD provide additional benefits at a cost that  society might be willing to pay. Strategies replacing WLC with PDD provide more life-years but it is unclear whether they are worth the extra cost.  ,  Context: lipid droplets are more heterogeneous: S3-12 and TIP47 coat smaller, peripheral  droplets and adipophilin coats a more medial population of droplets.  Fractionation of untreated and oleate-treated adipocytes shows oleate-dependent  redistribution of TIP47 and adipophilin from cytosolic fractions to the lipid  droplet fraction. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide does not  block the oleate-induced formation of the nascent lipid droplets, nor does it  prevent TAG accumulation.

Furthermore, the COP9 signalosome shares homologies with the  lid sibcomplex of the proteasome and is evolutionarily conserved from fission  yeast to humans. It is important for the proper development of virtually all higher eukaryotes. In recent years, significant progress has been made in  unraveling the molecular, cellular, and physiological mode of action of the COP9  signalosome. This review discusses our current understanding of the COP9 signalosome function with particular emphasis on its recently defined role in  modulating a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating specific protein  degradation events.  ,  Context: effective tools for individualized patient stratification and treatment planning  than traditional methods such as patient demographic variables and  histopathology indicators.Molecular biomarkers must be clinically validated  before they can be effectively applied toward patient management in clinical  practice.

However, carrying out this type of clinical study requires  optimization of traditional molecular expression profiling techniques to analyze  RNA from fixed, paraffin-embedded (FPE) tissues. In order to develop our clinically validated breast cancer assay, we modified molecular methods for RNA  extraction, RNA quantitation, reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR to  work optimally in archived clinical samples.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,Biallelic variants in PCDHGC4 cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD).," Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections. High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of  ,  Context: METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 43 CHD patients with heterotaxy for airway CD.  Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the  ,  Context: A commonly-assumed paradigm holds that the primary genetic determinant of  cardiovascular disease resides within the DNA sequence of our genes. This  paradigm can be challenged. For example, how do sequence changes in the  non-coding region of the genome influence phenotype? Why are all diseases not  shared between identical twins? Part of the answer lies in the fact that the  environment or exogenous stimuli clearly influence disease susceptibility, but  it was unclear in the past how these effects were signalled to the static DNA  code. Epigenetics is providing a newer perspective on these issues. Epigenetics  refers to chromatin-based mechanisms important in the regulation of gene expression that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence per se. The field can  be broadly categorized into three areas: DNA base modifications (including  cytosine methylation and cytosine hydroxymethylation), post-translational modifications of histone proteins, and RNA-based mechanisms that operate in the  nucleus. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the  epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis,  ,  Context: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration  characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort  of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome  sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations  ,  Context: Mutations causing genetic forms of Parkinson's disease or hereditary  neuropathies have been recently shown to affect key molecular players involved  in the recycling of defective mitochondria, most notably PARKIN, PINK1,  Mitofusin 2 or dynein heavy chain. Interestingly, the same pathways are also  indirectly targeted by multiple other mutations involved in familial forms of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease or Alzheimer's disease. These recent genetic results strongly reinforce the notion that defective  mitochondrial physiology might cause neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial  dysfunction has however been observed in virtually every neurodegenerative disease and appears not restricted to the most vulnerable neuronal populations  affected by a given disease. Thus, the mechanisms linking defective  mitochondrial quality control to death of selective neuronal populations remain  ,  Context: Propionic acidemia can result from mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes encoding  the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. We have  developed a method based on complementation of the enzyme defect using a  lipid-mediated transient transfection of the normal human PCCA or PCCB cDNA into  primary fibroblasts. We demonstrate the reliability of this method for  identification of the defective PCC gene in order to unequivocally approach the  mutational analysis in the corresponding PCCA and PCCB genes.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"Med220 and Med70 are subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. Additionally, CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that are shared with other cofactor complexes, including TATA binding protein-associated factors."," Context: CRSP-Med bound to VP16 and SREBP-1a. Notably, these activators induced distinct  conformational states upon binding the coactivator. Ostensibly, these different  conformational states result from VP16 and SREBP-1a targeting distinct subunits  in the CRSP-Med complex. To test this, we conducted a structural analysis of  CRSP-Med bound to either thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or vitamin D receptor  (VDR), both of which interact with the same subunit (Med220) of CRSP-Med.  Structural comparison of TR- and VDR-bound complexes (at a resolution of 29 A)  indeed reveals a shared conformational feature that is distinct from other known  CRSP- Med structures. Importantly, this nuclear receptor-induced structural shift seems largely dependent on the movement of Med220 within the complex.  ,  Context: The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  ,  Context: the TATA binding protein-associated factors to promote efficient activation of  transcription by Sp1. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that  are shared with other cofactor complexes. Here, we report a detailed  purification protocol for the isolation of CRSP from human HeLa cells. Our  purification strategy takes advantage of the ability of CRSP to bind  Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin as well as other conventional  chromatographic resins. We also describe a streamlined purification protocol  that allows a more rapid and efficient means to isolate active CRSP.  ,  Context: The neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent acute  toxins known and are the causative agents of the neuroparalytic disease  botulism. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by  blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are  seven distinct serotypes of toxin. All are polypeptides of Mr about 150 kDa that  have similar structure and pharmacological action. In their most active forms the toxins exist as dichain molecules in which a heavy (H) chain is linked by  disulphide bonding to a light (L) chain. The H chain is believed to be  associated with the highly specific and avid binding of toxin to the motor nerve end plates and also with the process of internalisation of the toxin. The toxic  activity appears to be associated with the L chain which blockades the  calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering at the  ,  Context:  Cristae junctions mark the boundaries of respiratory compartments in the inner  mitochondrial membrane.

Are Gram positive bacteria able to release extracellular vesicles?,"Yes, Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive bacterium, has been shown to release EVs, which were purified and characterized using density gradient ultracentrifug"," Context: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria release a variety of membrane vesicles  through different formation routes. Knowledge of the structure, molecular cargo  and function of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) is primarily obtained  from bacteria cultured in laboratory conditions. BEVs in human body fluids have  been less thoroughly investigated most probably due to the methodological  challenges in separating BEVs from their matrix and host-derived eukaryotic  extracellular vesicles (EEVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles. Here, we  present a step-by-step procedure to separate and characterize BEVs from human  body fluids. BEVs are separated through the orthogonal implementation of ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density-gradient  centrifugation. Size separates BEVs from bacteria, flagella and cell debris in  stool; and blood cells, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and soluble proteins in blood. Density separates BEVs from fibers, protein aggregates and EEVs in stool;  and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs),  chylomicrons, protein aggregates and EEVs in blood. The procedure is label free,  ,  Context:  Release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common feature among eukaryotes,  archaea, and bacteria. However, the biogenesis and downstream biological effects  of EVs released from gram-positive bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that EVs purified from a community-associated methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain were internalized into human macrophages in vitro  and that this process was blocked by inhibition of the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Human macrophages responded to S. aureus EVs by TLR2  signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through K+ efflux, leading to  the recruitment of ASC and activation of caspase-1. Cleavage of pro-interleukin  ,  Context:  Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayered lipid membrane structures,  bearing integral proteins and able to carry diverse cargo outside the cell to  distant sites. In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but  also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to  better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it  comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and  analyse the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical  ,  Context: Filifactor alocis, a gram-positive, obligate anaerobic rod, is an emerging  periodontal pathogen that is frequently isolated from patients with  periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and apical periodontitis. Recent studies have  shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from gram-negative periodontal  pathogens, so-called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), harbor various effector  molecules responsible for inducing host inflammatory responses. However, there are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and  characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their  immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density  gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission  electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270Â nm in  ,  Context:  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and can be found in cell  culture supernatants and biofluids. EVs carry proteins, nucleic acids, and other  cellular components and can deliver these to nearby or distant cells, making EVs of interest as both disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. EVs in biofluids  are heterogeneous, coming from different cell types and from different sources  with the cell, which limits the usefulness of bulk EV analysis methods that report the average features of all EVs present. Single-particle measurements  such as flow cytometry would be preferred, but the small size and low abundance  of surface antigens challenges conventional flow cytometry approaches, leading  ,  Context: here report that a relatively little-characterized group of proteins, septins,  is required to organize actin fibers on the inclusion and probably through actin  the release of the inclusion. Septins are a group of GTP-binding proteins that  can organize into heteromeric complexes and then into large filaments. Septins  have previously been found to be involved in the interaction of the cell with  bacteria in the cytosol. Our observation that they also organize a reaction to  bacteria living in vacuoles suggests that they have a function in the  recognition of foreign compartments by a parasitized human cell.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulating stress granule biogenesis. Specifically, AMPK activity is linked to SG formation, as pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered with SG formation, and AMPK-Î± knockdown revealed isoform-specific"," Context: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not  fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic Î±-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-Î± isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-Î±2, but not AMPK-Î±1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered  with SG formation. Second, AMPK-Î± knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative  SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third,  ,  Context: induction of new ones that were absent under normal conditions, or the  elimination of others that were normally present. Pointing toward the broad  involvement of different classes of RNAs, many of the newly observed PTMs  differed from those engaged in the known tRNA-based mechanism of translational  recoding, which is induced by oxidative stress. Some of the expression effects  were stress-specific, whereas others were not, thus suggesting that RNA PTMs may  perform multifaceted activities in stress response, which are subjected to  distinctive regulatory pathways. To explore their signaling networks, we  implemented a strategy based on the systematic deletion of genes that connect established response genes with PTM biogenetic enzymes in a putative  interactomic map. The results clearly identified PTMs that were under direct HOG  control, a well-known protein kinase pathway involved in stress response in eukaryotes. Activation of this signaling pathway has been shown to result in the  stabilization of numerous mRNAs and the induction of selected lncRNAs involved  in chromatin remodeling. The fact that PTMs are capable of altering the activity  ,  Context: RNA homopolymers or purified cellular RNA forms assemblies in vitro analogous to  stress granules. Remarkably, under conditions representative of an intracellular  stress response, the mRNAs enriched in assemblies from total yeast RNA largely  recapitulate the stress granule transcriptome. We suggest stress granules are  formed by a summation of protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, with RNA  self-assembly likely to contribute to other RNP assemblies wherever there is a  high local concentration of RNA. RNA assembly in vitro is also increased by GR  and PR dipeptide repeats, which are known to increase stress granule formation  in cells. Since GR and PR dipeptides are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this suggests that perturbations increasing RNA-RNA assembly in cells could lead  to disease.  ,  Context:  Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs.  Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some  degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome ofÂ yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of  purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence inÂ situ  hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting  efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules  correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability.  ,  Context: is an aggregation-prone protein and, given the role of toxic protein aggregates  in neurodegeneration, a toxic gain-of-function mechanism is another rational  hypothesis. Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43  to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that  cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress  granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs  in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in  neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus,  understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the  role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. We propose two models of TDP-43 aggregate  formation. The ""independent model"" stipulates that TDP-43 aggregation is independent of stress granule formation, in contrast to the ""precursor model""  which presents the idea that stress granule formation contributes to a TDP-43  aggregate ""seed"" and that chronic stress leads to concentration-dependent TDP-43  ,  Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ","25840010, 26733207, 29483269, 29129640, 22405725, 18775331",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010,,,,
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP is involved in transcriptional regulation, specifically in the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) in certain tumors and activated macrophages. Additionally, it stimulates"," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context: The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the  percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria.  Although some explanations have been proposed, these are at most partial  explanations as they cover only small percentages of the genes and do not even  consider the ones biased toward the lagging strand. We have carried out a  computational study on 725 bacterial genomes, aiming to elucidate other factors  that may have influenced the strand location of genes in a bacterium. Our  analyses suggest that (i) genes of some functional categories such as ribosome  have higher preferences to be on the leading strands; (ii) genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on  the lagging strands; (iii) there is a balancing force that tends to keep genes  from all moving to the leading and more efficient strand and (iv) the percentage of leading-strand genes in an bacterium can be accurately explained based on the  numbers of genes in the functional categories outlined in (i) and (ii), genome  size and gene density, indicating that these numbers implicitly contain the  ,  Context: We report in this paper that cycloheximide induces PAP mRNA expression in the  pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We  analyzed whether stabilization of the PAP mRNA or the direct induction of its  transcription contributed to the induction of PAP mRNA expression by the drug.  We first infected the cells, which do not express PAP mRNA constitutively, with  a recombinant adenovirus in which the PAP cDNA was subcloned downstream of the  CMV promotor, to obtain high levels of transcript. Then, transcription was  pharmacologically blocked, the cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the  PAP mRNA concentration was monitored over 8 h by Northern blot. PAP mRNA concentration remained unchanged for 4 h and then decreased in both  cycloheximide-treated and control cells, ruling out a significant contribution  of posttranscriptional regulation in cycloheximide induction. Direct regulation of gene transcription is therefore likely and we investigated whether it could  involve ADP-ribosylation. Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two  chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited  ,  Context: genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of  developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a  crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  Recently, new roles for succinate outside metabolism have emerged. Succinate  stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) in  specific tumors and in activated macrophages, and stimulates dendritic cells via  its receptor succinate receptor 1. Furthermore, succinate has been shown to post-translationally modify proteins. This expanding repertoire of functions for  succinate suggests a broader role in cellular activation. We review the new  roles of succinate and draw parallels to other metabolites such as NAD(+) and citrate whose roles have expanded beyond metabolism and into signaling.  ,  Context: hormone-releasing hormone analogue were followed up for periods ranging from 12  to 64 months. PSA and PAP levels were measured using immunometric assays. Both  cutoff-based and dynamic, serial sample-based decision criteria were employed.  With respect to a positive bone scan, PSA showed negative predictive values of  82 and 77%, respectively, using 4 and 10 ng/ml as cutoff points. Progression of  the disease to the bone occurred in 20 patients: in 17 PSA was the first  indicator of progression, in the other 3 PAP anticipated PSA for a very short  time (3-4 months), which was not of relevance to clinical decisions.

What is caused by SCUBE2 loss-of-function?,SCUBE2 loss-of-function impairs Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.," Context: Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) belongs to a  secreted and membrane-tethered multidomain SCUBE protein family composed of  three members found in vertebrates and mammals. Recent reports suggested that  zebrafish scube2 could facilitate sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling for proper  development of slow muscle. However, whether SCUBE2 can regulate the signaling  activity of two other hedgehog ligands (Ihh and Dhh), and the developmental relevance of the SCUBE2-induced hedgehog signaling in mammals remain poorly  understood. In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or  SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an  osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in  the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies  ,  Context: length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was  significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of  patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7,  TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2.  The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's  syndrome in SCA2.  ,  Context: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited,  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the  cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are  predominantly affected in SCA2. The cause of PC degeneration in SCA2 is unknown.  Here we demonstrate that mutant Atx2-58Q, but not wild-type (WT) Atx2-22Q,  specifically associates with the cytosolic C-terminal region of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))  release channel. Association with Atx2-58Q increased the sensitivity of  InsP(3)R1 to activation by InsP(3) in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments. To validate physiological significance of these findings, we  performed a series of experiments with an SCA2-58Q transgenic mouse model that  expresses human full-length Atx2-58Q protein under the control of a PC-specific  ,  Context: especially in developed countries. When plant-based beverages are the exclusive  diet in the first year of life and not consumed as a supplement to formula or  breastfeeding, it can result in severe nutritional problems. We report a case of  scurvy after exclusive intake of almond beverages and almond flour from 2.5 to  11.0 months of life. The patient was referred for pathologic fractures of the  femur, irritability, and failure to thrive. He had typical radiologic signs of  scurvy, such as osteopenia, cortical thinning, Wimberger ring, Frankel line,  fracture, and periosteal reaction. Moreover, his plasmatic vitamin C level was  very low. The child was diagnosed with scurvy and was started on vitamin C replacement therapy at a dose of 300 mg per day. Over the following 3 months,  his general condition, the pain in the legs, and the radiologic features  improved; the plasmatic vitamin C level was normalized; and the child started walking. In summary, this case demonstrates that scurvy is a new and severe  complication of improper use of almond drinks in the first year of life.  Manufacturers should indicate that these beverages are inappropriate for infants  ,  Context: reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal  proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The  ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been  shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a  toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as  well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be  anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis,  blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances. Dermatitis and CNS deficiency  have also been described. It is concluded that selenium plays an important role in regulating thyroid function, as well as in the homeostasis of thyroid  hormones through the action of selenoproteins, in which it incorporates as  selenocystein.  ,  Context: intake, and 15% of them have hypoproteinemia is (0% in omnivores). Low plasma  levels of iron and calcium, occurrence of hyposideremia (16% versus 2%) and  hypocalcemia (21% versus 8%) corresponds with intake of vegetal absorption  inhibitors (fytolic acid, oxalic acid, roughage). Frequently a mild form of  hyperhomocysteinemia is found (28% versus 5%), resulting vitamin B12 deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetarian diet is optimal for prevention of free-radical diseases,  especially those of the cardiovascular system. It may bring a risk from the  point of view of low iron and calcium absorption, low intake of methionine and  occurrence of mild forms of hyperhomocysteinemia. In traditional diet, total lipid content should be lowered, amount of vegetable oil with alpha-linolenic  acid should be elevated as well as fruit and vegetable consummation. Whole grain  food and oily seeds should be included into the daily food.

What is etarfolatide used for?,Etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-etarfolatide or (99m)Tc-EC20) is a noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent used to identify patients whose tumors express," Context: for reliable methods for the quantification of FRÎ± tissue expression. Therefore,  attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become  a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools  frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive  single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent,  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion  diagnostic with the FRÎ±-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to  identify patients whose tumors express FRÎ±. Vintafolide is a folic acid  conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRÎ±-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization.  (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for  noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRÎ± expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated  in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including  ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the  presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory  ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to  FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients  with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on  Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography  scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were  categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%),  and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide  uptake.  ,  Context: Biologic agents have been designed with the help of immunological studies to  target particular areas of the immune system which are thought to play a role in  the pathogenesis of disease. Etanercept is a soluble anti-tumor necrosis factor  alpha (TNF-alpha) agent licensed for the treatment of active poly-articular  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children aged 4 to 17 years who have  failed to respond to methotrexate alone, or who have been intolerant of  methotrexate. The safety and efficacy of etanercept in this patient group has  been established by one randomized controlled trial and several longitudinal  studies. This, together with the fact that until recently etanercept was the only anti-TNF licensed in JIA, has made it the most common first choice biologic  for many clinicians. However, there are still many unanswered questions about  etanercept, including its efficacy and safety in different subtypes of JIA, in children under 4 years of age and in those with uveitis. There are still  concerns about the long term safety of TNF antagonists in the pediatric age  group and unanswered questions about increased risks of malignancy and  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Vintafolide (EC145) is a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate that  binds to the folate receptor (FR), which is expressed on the majority of  epithelial ovarian cancers. This randomized phase II trial evaluated vintafolide  combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone. The  utility of an FR-targeted imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide (EC20), in  selecting patients likely to benefit from vintafolide was also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who  had undergone â¤ two prior cytotoxic regimens were randomly assigned at a 2:1  ratio to PLD (50 mg/m(2) intravenously [IV] once every 28 days) with or without vintafolide (2.5 mg IV three times per week during weeks 1 and 3). Etarfolatide  scanning was optional. The primary objective was to compare progression-free  survival (PFS) between the groups.  ,  Context:  Etanercept is a protein comprised of the extracellular domains of two TNF  receptors attached to a Fc portion of an IgG. Etanercept was approved for not  only reducing signs and symptoms but inhibiting of structural damage in patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs. Moreover,  combination therapy with methotrexate will be attractive for severely active  patients. The proportion of patients who have discontinued therapy due to adverse events is approximately 4%. Etanercept has not raised the risk for  serious infections(0.04/patient-year) as well as malignancies. There are  sporadic case reports of aplastic anemia, demyelination, lupus-like conditions,  ,  Context: TNF blockers have been available to treat various inflammatory disorders since  more than a decade. T cells and macrophages mainly express TNF and activate many  cells through two types of receptors. Pharmaceutical companies developed two  types of TNF blockers: soluble receptors and monoclonal antibodies.  Understanding of differences of structure and function can explain divergence of  efficacy or side effects. Etanercept has the best retention rate in rheumatic  diseases, but is less or not effective in granulomatous diseases, such as  inflammatory bowel diseases or uveitis. However, etanercept induces less  tuberculosis infections than anti-TNF blocker monoclonal antibodies.

Which R package could be used for the identification of pediatric brain tumors?,MethPed classifier is an R package that can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.," Context:  BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way  of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical  diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA  methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for  estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine  pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Identifying molecular cancer subtypes from multi-omics data is an  important step in the personalized medicine. We introduce CancerSubtypes, an R  package for identifying cancer subtypes using multi-omics data, including gene  expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation data. CancerSubtypes integrates  four main computational methods which are highly cited for cancer subtype  identification and provides a standardized framework for data pre-processing, feature selection, and result follow-up analyses, including results computing,  biology validation and visualization. The input and output of each step in the  framework are packaged in the same data format, making it convenience to compare different methods. The package is useful for inferring cancer subtypes from an  input genomic dataset, comparing the predictions from different well-known  methods and testing new subtype discovery methods, as shown with different  ,  Context: faster compared with the htslib C library using BCF files. For the allele  frequency calculation, the implementation in the SeqArray package is over 5  times faster than PLINK v1.9 with VCF and BCF files, and over 16 times faster  than vcftools. When used in conjunction with R/Bioconductor packages, the  SeqArray package provides users a flexible, feature-rich, high-performance  programming environment for analysis of WGS variant data.  AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/SeqArray. CONTACT: zhengx@u.washington.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.  ,  Context: transformation unless cellular programs that mediate apoptosis are disabled.  Here, we report a high frequency of medulloblastoma formation in mice after  postnatal overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in cooperation with  Shh. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 alone or in combination with N-Myc did not  induce tumors, indicating that Shh has essential transforming functions in GNPs  not supplied by the mitogenic stimulus of N-Myc combined with a strong  antiapoptotic signal provided by Bcl-2. Expression of endogenous Bcl-2 was not  up-regulated in Shh-induced tumors. Instead, elevated levels of phosphorylated  Akt were found, suggesting that activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling is one intrinsic mechanism for suppressing apoptosis in Shh-dependent  medulloblastomas. Thus, blockade of apoptosis cooperates with Shh-stimulated  proliferation to transform GNPs and induce aggressive medulloblastomas. These findings provide insights into the molecular signals that initiate  medulloblastoma formation and they support the importance of blocking apoptosis  in carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single  plot.

Cerliponase alfa is apprived for treatment of which disease?,Cerliponase alfa is approved for the treatment of CLN2 disease (also known as Batten disease).," Context: disease caused by a deficiency in TPP1. CLN2 is characterised by progressive  impairment of motor function, language deficiencies, seizures, ataxia, blindness  and early death, and intracerebroventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa has  been shown to reduce the progression of functional decline. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of cerliponase alfa leading to its  first global approval in the USA for the treatment of motor function loss in  paediatric patients â¥3Â years of age with CLN2, and subsequent approval in the EU  for CLN2 in all ages.  ,  Context: was well tolerated. Treatment was associated with anti-drug antibody (ADA)  production in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6/24 (25%) and in the serum of  19/24 (79%) of clinical trial subjects, respectively, over a mean exposure of  96.4â¯weeks (range 0.1-129â¯weeks). Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were not  detected in the CSF of any of the subjects. No events of anaphylaxis were  reported. Neither the presence of serum ADA nor drug-specific immunoglobulin E  was associated with the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity adverse  events. Serum and CSF ADA titers did not correlate with change in ML score.  Therefore, the development of an ADA response to cerliponase alfa is not predictive of an adverse safety profile or poor treatment outcome.  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (Â±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27Â±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12Â±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections. (Funded by BioMarin Pharmaceutical and others; CLN2 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01907087 and  NCT02485899 .).  ,  Context: RESULTS: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for the management of Gaucher  disease. Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over  another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a  lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative  treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however,  these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype  evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing  profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy  is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for  symptom management. CONCLUSION: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for treating type 1 Gaucher disease and substrate replacement therapy may be considered in patients who do  not tolerate or cannot receive enzyme replacement therapy.  ,  Context: reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies  included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme  replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher  disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in  people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two  years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement  therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1  Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study  examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement  therapy.Treatment-naÃ¯ve participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when  comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg  or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For  platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for  ,  Context: substrate, glucocerebroside. Accumulation of glucocerebroside substrate in  macrophages, as a result of loss of enzyme function, leads to the formation of  Gaucher cells causing hypertrophy of the spleen and liver, hematological  disorders, skeletal malformations and the neurological symptoms characteristic  of Gaucher's disease. The disease is subdivided into three types that differ in  their symptoms, severity and prognosis. Patients of any age can be affected but  those of a younger age have a poor prognosis often dying in infancy. As a  genetic disorder the incidence of the disease is variable on a global scale.  Enzyme replacement therapy is the therapy of choice and has demonstrated good efficacy in treating the visceral and skeletal symptoms of Gaucher's disease. A  cost-effective plant-cell-derived human recombinant glucocerebrosidase,  taliglucerase alfa, has been developed that demonstrated a promising safety and efficacy profile in phase I clinical trials and is currently in phase III and IV  trials for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with Gaucher's disease.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"3D printing has been tested for the construction of zigzag tubes, which is a logical first step towards successful organ printing. Additionally, it has been proposed as a method for printing complex 3D soft organs, such as those that would be used"," Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation. The main practical outcomes of organ-printing technology  are industrial scalable robotic biofabrication of complex human tissues and organs, automated tissue-based in vitro assays for clinical diagnostics, drug  discovery and drug toxicity, and complex in vitro models of human diseases. This  article describes conceptual framework and recent developments in organ-printing technology, outlines main technological barriers and challenges, and presents  potential future practical applications.  ,  Context:  The capability to print three-dimensional (3D) cellular tubes is not only a  logical first step towards successful organ printing but also a critical  indicator of the feasibility of the envisioned organ printing technology. A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D  complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with  an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular  tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even  after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good  ,  Context: Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.  ,  Context:  With the advantages of high throughput, digital control, and highly accurate  placement of cells and biomaterial scaffold to the desired 2D and 3D locations,  bioprinting has great potential to develop promising approaches in translational medicine and organ replacement. The most recent advances in organ and tissue  bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in  this review. Bioprinting has no or little side effect to the printed mammalian cells and it can conveniently combine with gene transfection or drug delivery to  the ejected living systems during the precise placement for tissue construction.  With layer-by-layer assembly, 3D tissues with complex structures can be printed  ,  Context:  3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or  metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional  object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional  object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in  engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on  ,  Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ","18154465, 22767299, 12679063, 22436025, 24288392, 12740943","Nose, ear and meniscus prototypes/constructs have been produced with 3D (3-dimesional) printing.","25641220, 19901446, 24288392, 23822094, 12679063, 24942232, 23635097, 24805923, 25159591, 25197745, 22436025, 23172542, 25387454, 25866560, 12740943, 25281749, 18154465, 25492194, 2087655, 25691496, 25839977, 25093879",,,,
Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Ã resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ,  Context: Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  ,  Context: subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters  (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2,  SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6,  SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to  the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p  binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding  correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11,  MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1  transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p  regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a  repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol  metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by  regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,HEp-2 cells are laryngeal cancer cells.," Context: in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2  cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to  examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination  confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully  established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the  purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is seldom mentioned. In this study, we  investigated luteolin against human laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells,  using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Luteolin inhibited  Hep-2 cells proliferation at the inhibitive concentrations of 50% (IC50) near to  50 Î¼M and induced the apoptosis in Hep-2 cells through caspase-3 and caspase-8  activation. Up-regulation of Fas and down-regulation of long form cellular  FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) protein were also involved after  luteolin treatment at both protein and mRNA levels. Luteolin could not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis by activating the Fas  signaling pathway at the receptor level in laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2  cells.  ,  Context: Author information: (1)Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

However, its synthesis can be rapidly stimulated by a  variety of inflammatory mediators. In this study, we provide evidence that PAI-2  interacts with proteasome and affects its activity in endothelial cells. To  ensure that the PAI-2Â·proteasome complex is formed in vivo, both proteins were  coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cells and identified with specific  antibodies. The specificity of this interaction was evidenced after (a)  transfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-2 and coimmunoprecipitation of both  proteins with anti-PAI-2 antibodies and (b) silencing of the PAI-2 gene using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Subsequently, cellular distribution of  the PAI-2Â·proteasome complexes was established by immunogold staining and  electron microscopy analyses. As judged by confocal microscopy, both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but they also could be found in a dense  perinuclear and nuclear location. PAI-2 was not polyubiquitinated, suggesting  that it bound to proteasome not as the substrate but rather as its inhibitor.  ,  Context: screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes,  RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, RPS10,  RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3,  RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A,  RPS2, and RPL38, in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. We identified three  distinct mutations of RPS10 in five probands and nine distinct mutations of  RPS26 in 12 probands. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients  bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA.  This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that  mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of  the proteins in rRNA processing.

Is Epistaxis associated with dental implant placement?,"Yes, epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. In one study, a patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was treated by antibiotic therapy, and another study mentions minor complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis."," Context: during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to  3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N. Effect of Schneiderian Membrane Perforation on  Posterior Maxillary Implant Survival. J Int Oral Health 2013; 5(3):28-34.  ,  Context: markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs,  representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (pâ<â.05).  RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the  study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment,  hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus,  and mobility. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated  with implant loss.  ,  Context: of dental implants. In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several  treatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the  installation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting  materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6âmonths of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.  ,  Context: Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in  orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these  implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still  exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called  osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of  drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic  bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate;  anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin,  biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators  ,  Context: RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI  0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a  change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR  values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: clinical activity in MF with minimal myelosuppression. Due to an FDA-mandated  full clinical hold, the randomized phase 3 PERSIST trials were abruptly stopped  and PAC was immediately discontinued for all patients. Thirty-three patients  benefitting from PAC on clinical trial prior to the hold were allowed to resume  therapy on an individual, compassionate-use basis. This study reports the  detailed outcomes of 19 of these PAC retreatment patients with a median  follow-up of 8Â months. Despite a median platelet count of 49âÃâ109/L at restart  of PAC, no significant change in hematologic profile was observed. Grade 3/4  adverse events of epistaxis (nâ=â1), asymptomatic QT prolongation (nâ=â1), and bradycardia (nâ=â1) occurred in three patients within the first 3Â months of  retreatment. One death due to catheter-associated sepsis occurred. The median  time to discontinuation of PAC therapy on compassionate use for all 33 patients was 12.2 (95% CI 8.3-NR) months.

Can AGY be used as antidiuretic replacement therapy?,"No, AGY (oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody) is a novel treatment to neutralize gluten in patients with celiac disease, it has no relation to diuretics or antidiuretic hormone secretion."," Context: BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder of the  small intestine. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved  treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from  inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a  novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in  patients with CD.  METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with  biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical  examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue  transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion  ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week  treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4Â years, nine female).  ,  Context: The use of anticancer drugs is beneficial for patients with malignancies but is  frequently associated with the occurrence of electrolyte disorders, which can be  hazardous and in many cases fatal. The review presents the electrolyte  abnormalities that can occur with the use of anticancer drugs and provides the  related mechanisms. Platinum-containing anticancer drugs induce hypomagnesemia,  hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Moreover, platinum-containing drugs are associated  with hyponatremia, especially when combined with large volumes of hypotonic  fluids aiming to prevent nephrotoxicity. Alkylating agents have been linked with  the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia,  aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). Vinca alkaloids are associated  with hyponatremia due to SIADH. Epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody inhibitors induce hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Other,  monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, cause hyponatremia due to SIADH.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are linked to hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia.  ,  Context: Author information: (1)Department of Population Health Sciences, Division of Health System  Innovation and Research, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City,  UT, United States of America.

In the case of hypertension treatment, their  main indication is higher age and isolated systolic hypertension. In the case of  heart failure they are used for the treatment of swellings and shortness of  breath. The most frequently prescribed group of diuretics is thiazides and  similar products. In patients with renal insufficiency, loop diuretics are  administered. In the case of hypertension, diuretics are mainly used in the  combination treatment. The most frequently used diuretic in combination is again  hydrochlorothiazide, which is combined with reninangiotensin system blockers. It is mainly the combination of an ACE inhibitor + indapamide that seems to be  modern and promising, and it is, on the basis of large clinical trials,  recommended also for diabetics (ADVANCE) or for secondary prevention following a cerebrovascular accident (PROGRESS) or for the elderly (HYVET). Also a  combination of two diuretics is popular -â mainly hydrochlorothiazide +  amiloride. A combination of a betablocker and diuretic is less suitable.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,Endometriosis.," Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: Both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and  OnabotulinumtoxinA (botox) are used in the prevention of chronic migraines.  However, it is not clear which is more effective overall. This review will  compare the efficacy, side effects, cost-effectiveness, and other factors  between CGRP mAbs and botox. We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar using the  keywords migraines, CGRP mAbs, botox, efficacy, side effects, aura. All articles, including case-control/cohort studies, case series, case reports,  randomized control trials, traditional/systematic reviews, were analyzed. CGRP  mAbs and botox both reduce the frequency of migraines in patients. Patients have reported they decreased migraines' frequency and intensity in several studies  after being given each medication. While CGRP mAbs are more recent medications,  botox has been studied for more than a decade as a migraine preventative.

It can widely vary among patients because of different age of  onset, type of symptoms, areas of involvement, and disease severity. The choice  of the treatment of psoriasis should be personalized according to the specific  needs of the patients. Apremilast is a well-tolerated and effective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this article,  the pharmacological, clinical, and safety aspects of apremilast are reviewed. Based on these data, apremilast could be indicated for patients with a Psoriasis  Area and Severity Index score <10 but with a significant impact on quality of  life and seems to be an appropriate treatment for elderly patients also.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cariprazine was approved for treating schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder, and currently is being evaluated for treating depression in clinical  trials in the United States. We systematically reviewed the literature on the  efficacy and safety of cariprazine. METHODS: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO,  EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through August 31, 2016. The search was not restricted by patient age. Articles published in English or official  English translations were included. RESULTS: Eleven articles that evaluated the use of cariprazine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders were identified. Four trials evaluated the safety and  efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as  an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials  ,  Context: relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds,  respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During  treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three  months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on  degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of  differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment  discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%;  degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with  its mechanism of action.

What is BBCAnalyzer?,BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) is a tool that provides a novel visual approach to facilitate manual inspection of common mutation sites by visualizing base counts at predefined positions or regions in any sequence alignment data available as BAM files.," Context: variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of  variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters. Any expected  mutations (e.g. hotspot mutations), that have not been called by the software,  need to be investigated manually. RESULTS: BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) provides a novel visual approach  to facilitate this step of time-consuming, manual inspection of common mutation  sites. BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or  regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files.

By uniting this information in a graphical way, the user may easily decide  on a variant being present or not - completely independent of any internal  ,  Context: The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining  complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been  subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep  theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide  polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a  plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed.  However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing  whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for  the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used  SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster  than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core  processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to  deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well  ,  Context:  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care  analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications.

FT-IR spectrometry was also suitable for nearly on-line monitoring of the exhaled ethanol and methanol during hemodialysis. The breath analysis  results correlated well with blood samples. The FT-IR method used also has a  traceable calibration to physical properties of the analyte, and the measured  ,  Context: Top-down proteomics, the analysis of intact proteins (instead of first digesting  them to peptides), has the potential to become a powerful tool for mass  spectrometric protein characterization. Requirements for extremely high mass  resolution, accuracy, and ability to efficiently fragment large ions have often  limited top-down analyses to custom built FT-ICR mass analyzers. Here we explore  the hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ)-Orbitrap, a novel, high performance, and  compact mass spectrometric analyzer, for top-down proteomics. Protein standards  from 10 to 25 kDa were electrosprayed into the instrument using a  nanoelectrospray chip. Resolving power of 60,000 was ample for isotope resolution of all protein charge states. We achieved absolute mass accuracies  for intact proteins between 0.92 and 2.8 ppm using the ""lock mass"" mode of  operation. Fifty femtomole of cytochrome c applied to the chip resulted in spectra with excellent signal-to-noise ratio and only low attomole sample  consumption.

Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of  developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results. In  a typical GES search (GESS), a query GES is searched against a database of GESs  obtained from large numbers of measurements, such as different genetic  backgrounds, disease states and drug perturbations.

It would be several magnitudes faster than the software algorithm  alternatives.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental analysis method  used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications. Prior MSA  acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance  limitations according to Amdahl's Law. This work is the first known to  accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware. RESULTS: We reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before  they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator. Using an FPGA accelerator, an  overall speedup of up to 150 has been demonstrated on a large data set when  ,  Context: millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's  computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context: Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.  ,  Context: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman algorithm  is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences. When  searching sequence databases that may contain billions of sequences, this  algorithm becomes computationally expensive. Consequently, in this paper, we  focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the  computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. These simple modifications accelerated the algorithm runtime by an  average of 287% compared to the pure software implementation. Therefore, further  design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a promising direction to seeking runtime improvement of genomic database searching.  ,  Context: studies is rather low suggest that aligning (parts of) those reads with a single  gap is in fact desirable. RESULTS: In this article, we present libgapmis, a library for extending pairwise  short-read alignments. Apart from the standard CPU version, it includes  ultrafast SSE- and GPU-based implementations. libgapmis is based on an algorithm  computing a modified version of the traditional dynamic-programming matrix for  sequence alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the  functions of the CPU version provided in this library accelerate the  computations by a factor of 20 compared to other programmes. The analogous SSE- and GPU-based implementations accelerate the computations by a factor of 6 and  11, respectively, compared to the CPU version. The library also provides the  user the flexibility to split the read into fragments, based on the observed gap occurrence frequency and the length of the read, thereby allowing for a  variable, but bounded, number of gaps in the alignment.

Describe OligoSTORM,"Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides used for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation."," Context: Cathepsin B (CB) is involved in degradation of extracellular matrix proteins  during tumor progression in human solid organ tumors (such as colorectal,  bladder, and breast cancers), including human prostate cancer. Its activities  are regulated by endogenous inhibitors (such as stefins or cystatins). Increased  expression of cathepsin B message, protein, and membrane association have been  linked to malignancy, but there are very few studies of their mRNA expression in prostate cancer using in situ hybridization techniques. Our objective was to  determine the relationship of CB and stefin A (cystatin A) mRNA localization to  the Gleason grading system for histologic scores in the hope of distinguishing aggressive and less aggressive variants of prostate cancer. We used a 25-base  biotinylated oligonucleotide CB cDNA antisense probe to localize CB message and  a 27-base biotinylated oligonucleotide stefin A cDNA antisense probe to localize  ,  Context:  Oligopaint probes are fluorescently labeled, single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides that can be used to visualize genomic regions ranging in size  from tens of kilobases to many megabases. This unit details how Oligopaint probes can be synthesized using basic molecular biological techniques, and  provides protocols for FISH, 3D-FISH, and sample preparation.  ,  Context: A host of observations demonstrating the relationship between nuclear  architecture and processes such as gene expression have led to a number of new  technologies for interrogating chromosome positioning. Whereas some of these  technologies reconstruct intermolecular interactions, others have enhanced our  ability to visualize chromosomes in situ. Here, we describe an oligonucleotide-  and PCR-based strategy for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a  bioinformatic platform that enables this technology to be extended to any  organism whose genome has been sequenced. The oligonucleotide probes are  renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers  precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and  multicolor imaging of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with the same basic protocol. We anticipate this technology will lead to an enhanced  ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes.  ,  Context: to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear  bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression.  Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each  of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge  of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable  the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside  cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence  labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path  of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus  from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized  to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method,  ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ  probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the  ,  Context: date, only few cases have been described which result from pure monosomy for a  deletion of 16p. In most of these cases the deletion was identified by  densitometric analysis of Southern blot results or by Fluorescent In Situ  Hybridization analysis, and these alterations have not been mapped in detail. In  this study, we have fine mapped deletions causing alpha-thalassemia within 2 Mb  from the telomere of 16p by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  (MLPA). We have developed a rapid and simple test for high resolution mapping of  rearrangements involving the tip of the short arm of chromosome 16 by  incorporating 62 MLPA probes spaced approximately 10-200 kb over a region of 2 Mb from the telomere. One deletion of approximately 900 kb without MR was  identified in addition to three de novo deletions varying between 1.5 and 2 Mb  causing ATR-16 in three patients having mild MR and alpha-thalassemia.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2B6," Context: Modified nucleotides in messenger RNA (mRNA) have been discovered over 40 years  ago, but until recently little was known about which transcripts contain them  and what their function is. High-throughput sequencing approaches revealed a  dynamic landscape of the 'Epitranscriptome' for many mRNA modifications in  various organisms from yeast to humans. Meanwhile, also many genes encoding  mRNA-modifying enzymes and auxiliary proteins have been identified yielding  functional insights by reverse genetics into their role in development and  disease.  ,  Context: focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding.  Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the  dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic  metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good  interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral  factor Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible  and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to  interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major  CYP450 enzyme.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.Î±-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences.

After multiple-dose administration of upadacitinib 30 mg  once daily, upadacitinib mean Â± SD AUC0-24 was 641 Â± 177 ngÂ·h/mL, and Cmax was  83.3 Â± 30.7 ng/mL. These results confirm that upadacitinib has no relevant  effect on pharmacokinetics of substrates metabolized by CYP2B6.  ,  Context: Cholangiocytes, bile duct lining cells, actively adjust the amount of  cholesterol and bile acids in bile through expression of enzymes and channels  involved in transportation and metabolism of the cholesterol and bile acids.

Among the cytochrome p450 (Cyp) enzymes involved in bile acid  biosynthesis, sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27) that is the rate-limiting enzyme for the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis expressed in cholangiocytes.  Expression of other Cyp enzymes for the basic bile acid biosynthesis was hardly  detected. The Cyp27 expression was negatively regulated by a hydrophobic bile acid through farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor activated by bile  acid ligands.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates its own levels through a positive feedback mechanism, which may play an important role during replicative senescence. Additionally, HuR promotes cell survival by keeping p53 levels in check in progenitor cells. In human fibroblasts"," Context: the cytoplasmic levels of a chimeric luciferase-HuR 3'-UTR reporter transcript,  as well as luciferase activity; conversely, HuR knockdown reduced both  parameters. Moreover, the loss of HuR in senescent, late-passage HDFs was  accompanied by a reduced cytoplasmic presence of endogenous HuR mRNA, ectopic  Luc-HuR-3'UTR reporter transcript, and luciferase activity relative to what was  observed in young, early-passage cells. Our results reveal a positive feedback  mechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the  regulation of HuR during replicative senescence.  ,  Context: HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor  cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  led to compromised hematopoietic reconstitution but did not cause lethality.  Expression of p53 and its downstream effectors critical for cell death were  induced in progenitor cells as HuR levels declined. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative  regulator of p53. Furthermore, cell survival was restored by expression of Mdm2  in Elavl1-/- cells, suggesting that HuR keeps p53 levels in check in progenitor cells and thereby promotes cell survival. This regulation of cell stress  response by HuR in progenitor cells, which we believe to be novel, could  potentially be exploited in cytotoxic anticancer therapies as well as stem cell  transplant therapy.  ,  Context: Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human  fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also  decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. We therefore postulated that AMPK  activation in human fibroblasts might contribute to the implementation of the  senescence phenotype through mechanisms that included a reduction in HuR cytoplasmic presence. Indeed, AMP:ATP ratios were 2-3-fold higher in senescent  fibroblasts compared with young fibroblasts. Accordingly, in vitro senescence  was accompanied by a marked elevation in AMPK activity. Evidence that increased  ,  Context:  ELAV proteins are implicated in regulating the stability and translation of  cytokine and growth regulatory mRNAs such as GM-CSF, IL-2, c-myc, c-fos and  GLUT1 by binding to their AU-rich 3'UTRs. The tissue-specific ELAV protein HuB (aka. Hel-N1) is predominantly cytoplasmic and has been shown to stabilize GLUT1  and c-myc mRNAs and to increase their translation following ectopic expression  in 3T3-L1 cells. We report that the most widely expressed mouse ELAV protein, mHuA, is predominately nuclear in cultured NIH-3T3 cells, but is localized in  the cytoplasm during early G1 of the cell cycle. Therefore, much like the  primarily cytoplasmic HuB, HuA becomes temporally localized in the cytoplasm  ,  Context: The ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) or ELAVL1 is  implicated in a variety of biological processes as well as being linked with a  number of diseases, including cancer. Despite a great deal of prior  investigation into HuR, there is still much to learn about its function. We take  an important step in this direction by conducting cross-linking and  immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing experiments followed by an extensive computational analysis to determine the characteristics of the HuR binding site  and impact on the transcriptome. We reveal that HuR targets predominantly  uracil-rich single-stranded stretches of varying size, with a strong conservation of structure and sequence composition. Despite the fact that HuR  sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR  in regulating splicing. HuR sites in 3'-UTRs overlap extensively with predicted  ,  Context: Post-transcriptional regulatory networks are dependent on the interplay of many  RNA-binding proteins having a major role in mRNA processing events in mammals.  We have been interested in the concerted action of the two RNA-binding proteins  hnRNP A1 and HuR, both stable components of immunoselected hnRNP complexes and  having a major nuclear localization. Specifically, we present here the  application of the RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP)-Chip technology to identify a  population of nuclear transcripts associated with hnRNP A1-RNPs as isolated from  the nuclear extract of either HuR WT or HuR-depleted (KO) mouse embryonic  fibroblast (MEF) cells. The outcome of this analysis was a list of target genes regulated via HuR for their association (either increased or reduced) with the  nuclear hnRNP A1-RNP complexes. Real time PCR analysis was applied to validate a  selected number of nuclear mRNA transcripts, as well as to identify pre-spliced transcripts (in addition to their mature mRNA counterpart) within the isolated  nuclear hnRNP A1-RNPs. The differentially enriched mRNAs were found to belong to  GO categories relevant to biological processes anticipated for hnRNP A1 and HuR  ","20007147, 19884656, 12730239, 9763509, 21890634, 24152440","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFÎ²1 under exogenous TGFÎ²1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.

What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of an organism, specifically in budding yeast."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show  ,  Context: genes. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores  DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de  novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic  level, combining a DNA methylation microarray and the nucleosome positioning  technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome  occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there  is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of  nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the  recruitment of the other.  ,  Context: The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin has profound consequences for  gene regulation, as well as for other DNA transactions such as recombination,  replication and repair. Understanding how this packaging is determined is  consequently a pressing problem in molecular genetics. DNA sequence, chromatin  remodelers and transcription factors affect chromatin structure, but the scope  of these influences on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy patterns remains  uncertain. Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the  contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome  occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show  localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or  Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites having a wide range of affinities. These results indicate that DNA-binding  transcription factors affect chromatin structure, and probably dynamics,  throughout the genome to a much greater extent than previously appreciated.  ,  Context: enhancer activity, although it was weaker than HS2 and more sensitive to the  spacer DNA. The miniLCR had the strongest enhancer activity and functioned even  at a distance of 7.3 kb. A model is proposed in which synergistic interactions  between HSs confer long-range activation by creating a stable LCR nucleoprotein  structure, which is competent for recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. These  enzymes would mediate the well-characterized activity of the LCR to modulate  chromatin structure.

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, there is no mention of desmin presence in plants. All mentions of desmin relate to muscle cells, myocardium, cardiomyocytes, and other animal tissues."," Context: Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate  filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in  the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific  fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest  impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. To determine whether altered  capillary function or an intrinsic cardiomyocyte defect is responsible for  desmin null DCM, transgenic mice were generated to rescue desmin expression  specifically to cardiomyocytes. Desmin rescue mice display a wild-type cardiac phenotype with no fibrosis or calcification in the myocardium and normalization  of coronary flow. Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is also restored to normal.  Markers of hypertrophy upregulated in desmin null hearts return to wild-type levels in desmin rescue mice. Working hearts were perfused to assess coronary  flow and cardiac power. Restoration of a wild-type cardiac phenotype in a desmin  null background by expression of desmin specifically within cardiomyocyte  ,  Context: include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin  expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish coincides with that reported for MyoD and myogenin.  ,  Context: partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of  desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and  pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that  its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies. Future studies should focus on these aspects.  ,  Context: consensus gained is that up-regulation of each of the HSPs in the heart is  protective against insults such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. CryAB  modulates protein aggregation of abnormal desmin. With respect to the  cytoskeleton, disruption of the non-sarcomeric actin linkage at the intercalated  discs via overexpressing the VASP-EHV1 domain is sufficient to cause dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM). Up-regulation of microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4)  results in microtubule densification. Myocyte contractile malfunction  characteristic of pressure overload hypertrophy is recapitulated by  cardiac-restricted overexpression of MAP4. In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function  studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial  dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks  resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been  shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their  ,  Context: Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of  myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the  extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of  myofibrils. In contrast to prior expectations, we showed that some of the known  disease-causing mutations, such as DesA360P, DesQ389P and DesD399Y, are  assembly-competent and do allow formation of bona fide IFs in vitro and in vivo. We also previously demonstrated that atomic force microscopy can be employed to  measure the tensile properties of single desmin IFs. Using the same approach on  filaments formed by the aforementioned mutant desmins, we now observed two different nanomechanical behaviors: DesA360P exhibited tensile properties  similar to that of wild-type desmin IFs, whereas DesQ389P and DesD399Y exhibited  local variations in their tensile properties along the filament length. Based on  ,  Context: We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide,  electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine  heart Purkinje fibers. One of the Mabs, 39AB6, revealed desmin only in cow  Purkinje fibers and did not react with desmins from other muscle cells,  including ventricular cardiac muscle, striated muscle and smooth muscle, as  revealed by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Desphosphorylation of electrophoretically separated polypeptides on nitrocellulose with alkaline  phosphatase did not affect the binding of the Mab. The present results show that  there are cell-type specific antigenic determinants in intermediate proteins of  the desmin type.

Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?,"Hotair, Mir155hg, SR-lncRNA-1, and SR-lncRNA-2 are the lncRNAs that are regulated by Sam68."," Context: expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked  to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated  genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the  lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1  and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68  binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the  half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2,  while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and  SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the  adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a  new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.  ,  Context: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been attracting immense research interest,  while only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized thoroughly. Their  involvement in the fundamental cellular processes including regulate gene  expression at epigenetics, transcription, and post-transcription highlighted a  central role in cell homeostasis. However, lncRNAs studies are still at a  relatively early stage, their definition, conservation, functions, and action  mechanisms remain fairly complicated. Here, we give a systematic and  comprehensive summary of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs in order to provide a  better understanding of this new studying field. lncRNAs play important roles in brain development, neuron function and maintenance, and neurodegenerative  diseases are becoming increasingly evident. In this review, we also highlighted  recent studies related lncRNAs in central nervous system (CNS) development and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  and elucidated some specific lncRNAs which may be important for understanding  ,  Context: Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases pose severe threats to human  health worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that at least 50% of foam cells  in atheromas are derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); the first  step in this process involves migration to human atherosclerotic lesions. Long  nonâcoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play significant roles in diverse  biological processes. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in VSMCs. The expression of lncRNAs or mRNAs was detected using reverse  transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Gene Expression  Omnibus datasets in the NCBI portal were searched using the key words 'Atherosclerosis AND tissue AND HomoÂ sapiens' and the GSE12288 dataset. Gene  expression in circulating leukocytes was measured to identify patients with  coronary artery diseaseÂ (CAD) or controls, and used to analyze the correlation  ,  Context: A significant portion of the mammalian genome encodes numerous transcripts that  are not translated into proteins, termed long non-coding RNAs. Initial studies  identifying long non-coding RNAs inferred these RNA sequences were a consequence  of transcriptional noise or promiscuous RNA polymerase II activity. However, the  last decade has seen a revolution in the understanding of regulation and  function of long non-coding RNAs. Now it has become apparent that long  non-coding RNAs play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes.  In this review, we describe the current understanding of long non-coding  RNA-mediated regulation of cellular processes: differentiation, development, and  disease.  ,  Context: signatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA  cross-linking and reverse transcription. We found that these antibodies  similarly induced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a  modification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these  signatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and  mouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of  m6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lncRNA profiling during tilapia peritoneal  macrophages (TPMs) activation and discuss the relationship between lncRNA and  mRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the lncRNA and  mRNA profiles of TPMs activation following stimulation with Streptococcus  agalactiae (Sa) antigen, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP70+Sa. The  expressions of lncRNA and mRNA were confirmed by qPCR. 356 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA  and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially  expressed by pairwise comparison. These lncRNAs were shorter in length, fewer in  exon number and higher in expression levels as compared with mRNAs. 683 lncRNAs and 4320 mRNAs were co-located, while 316 lncRNAs and 9997 mRNAs were in  co-expression networks.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW is the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words.," Context: MOTIVATION: The biological significance of minimal absent words has been  investigated in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. For instance,  three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus  genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all  minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based  on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a  large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n Â bytes of RAM. Such memory  requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words  in large datasets. RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing  minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made  available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than  3âh on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as  1âGB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making  ,  Context: open-source code of our implementation is freely available at  http://github.com/solonas13/maw . CONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being  replaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences  in terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent  words. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm  for the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.  ,  Context: that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An  implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful  for applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless,  the number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most  linearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow exponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed  additional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing  studies on the topic.  ,  Context:  An absent word (also called a forbidden word or an unword in other contexts) in  a sequence is a segment that does not appear in the given sequence. It is a  minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in the given sequence. In this article, we review the concept of minimal absent words, which includes the  notion of shortest absent words but is much stronger. We present an efficient  method for computing the minimal absent words of bounded length for DNA sequence using a Trie of bounded depth, representing bounded length factors. This method  outputs the whole set of minimal absent words and furthermore our technique  provides a linear-time algorithm with less memory usage than previous solutions.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package available on Bioconductor for detecting hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs."," Context: for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is  robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the  TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved  across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor,  http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .  ,  Context: metagenic structure was due to the accumulation of long-range regulations  flanking Hox loci, a phenomenon made possible by the successive genome  duplications that occurred at the root of the vertebrate lineage, similar to  gene neofunctionalization but applied to a coordinated multigenic system. Here,  we propose that the emergence of such large vertebrate regulatory landscapes  containing a range of global enhancers was greatly facilitated by the presence  of topologically associating domains (TADs). These chromatin domains, mostly  constitutive, may have been used as genomic niches where novel regulations could  evolve due to both the preexistence of a structural backbone poised to integrate novel regulatory inputs, and a highly adaptive transcriptional readout. We  propose a scenario for the coevolution of such TADs and the emergence of  pleiotropy at ancestral vertebrate Hox loci.  ,  Context:  A current question in the high-order organization of chromatin is whether  topologically associating domains (TADs) are distinct from other hierarchical  chromatin domains. However, due to the unclear TAD definition in tradition, the structural and functional uniqueness of TAD is not well studied. In this work,  we refined TAD definition by further constraining TADs to the optimal separation  on global intra-chromosomal interactions. Inspired by this constraint, we developed a novel method, called HiTAD, to detect hierarchical TADs from Hi-C  chromatin interactions. HiTAD performs well in domain sensitivity, replicate  reproducibility and inter cell-type conservation. With a novel domain-based  ,  Context:  Recent research using chromatin conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C,  has demonstrated the importance of topologically associated domains (TADs) and  smaller chromatin loops, collectively referred hereafter as ""interacting domains."" Many such domains change during development or disease, and exhibit  cell- and condition-specific differences. Quantification of the dynamic behavior  of interacting domains will help to better understand genome regulation. Methods for comparing interacting domains between cells and conditions are highly  limited. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of  boundaries of interacting domains between two or more Hi-C datasets.

What is the route of administration of vaxchora?,"Vaxchora is administered orally as a single-dose, live attenuated vaccine."," Context: Vaxchora is the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for  the prophylaxis of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral suspension vaccine, travelers can now visit these areas with less chance of  contracting the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera infections.  ,  Context: RESULTS: In August 1998 the Food and Drug Administration in the United States  approved the licensure of a rotavirus vaccine. Both the Advisory Committee of  Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics are likely to  recommend that the vaccine be given to all children by mouth as a series of  three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The vaccine is made by combining a  simian rotavirus strain (RRV) with several human strains representing different  rotavirus serotypes. An understanding of the biology, immunology, and virology  of rotavirus will help to explain the strengths and limitations of the rotavirus  vaccine. CONCLUSION: If used as recommended, the rotavirus vaccine should cause a significant decrease in the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and office  visits of children infected with rotavirus.  ,  Context: 15 weeks was associated with rotavirus vaccination (OR: 5.1; 95% CI 2.7, 9.4),  and receipt of the second pentavalent dose by age 32 weeks was associated with  receipt of two rotavirus vaccine doses (OR: 5.0; 95% CI 2.1-12.3). Timely  coverage with the first pentavalent vaccine dose was 88.2% in the 2007 cohort  and 91.1% in the 2008 cohort (p=0.04). Children born in 2009, when a four-month  national rotavirus vaccine stock-out occurred, had an older median age of  receipt of rotavirus vaccine and were less likely to receive rotavirus on the  same date as the same dose of pentavalent vaccine than children born in 2007 and  2008. Upper age limit recommendations for rotavirus vaccine administration contributed to suboptimal vaccination coverage. Survey data suggest that late  rotavirus vaccination and co-administration with later doses of pentavalent  vaccine among children born in 2009 helped increase rotavirus vaccine coverage following shortages.  ,  Context: adherence with the recommended schedules. We identified factors associated with  completing the full rotavirus series by performing multiple logistic regression  analyses. We also evaluated potential changes in uptake and timeliness of other  routine vaccines after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine using the  Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The national coverage for rotavirus vaccine achieved a year after the  introduction was 89% for one dose and 82% for two doses, respectively. Among  fully rotavirus-vaccinated children, 98% received both doses within the upper  age limit and 90% received both doses according to the recommended schedule. The  child's age at the initiation of rotavirus series and being vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b  (DTaP/IPV/Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines were the strongest predictors of  completing the full rotavirus series. No major changes in uptake and timeliness of other paediatric vaccines were observed after introduction of rotavirus  vaccine.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,"The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome, specifically at location Xp22.3."," Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and  we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher  TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic  B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of  ,  Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ,  Context: Women develop stronger immune responses than men, with positive effects on the  resistance to viral or bacterial infections but magnifying also the  susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants,  identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. METHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the  TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274  healthy female controls.  ,  Context: The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,"Slit proteins and NELL1/2 are ligands for the Roundabout (Robo) family of receptors. Specifically, Slit proteins bind to Robo receptors, while NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type"," Context: structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis  for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures  reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell  surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation  arrays. Upon Slit -N binding Robo receptors must undergo a conformational change  for Ig4 mediated dimerisation and signaling, probably via endocytosis.  Furthermore, it's become clear that Robo receptors do not only act alone, but as  large and more complex cell surface receptor assemblies to manifest directional  and growth effects in a concerted fashion. These context dependent assemblies provide a mechanism to fine tune attractive and repulsive signals in a  combinatorial manner required during neuronal development. While a mechanistic  understanding of Slit mediated Robo signaling has advanced significantly further structural studies on larger assemblies are required for the design of new  experiments to elucidate their role in cell surface receptor complexes. These  will be necessary to understand the role of Slit -Robo signaling in  ,  Context:  The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout  (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the  nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this  study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1  and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin  type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis  revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for  ,  Context: The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo  receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have  investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have individually deleted each of Drosophila Robo1's three Fn repeats, and then  tested these Robo1 variants in vitro to determine their ability to bind Slit in  cultured Drosophila cells and in vivo to investigate the requirement for each domain in regulating Robo1's embryonic expression pattern, axonal localization,  midline repulsive function, and sensitivity to Commissureless (Comm)  downregulation. We demonstrate that the Fn repeats are not required for Robo1 to  ,  Context: actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on  different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle,  mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression  system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits  (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta,  epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with  cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination).  Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50  11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively).

The molecular mechanisms  involve signal transduction via mitogen-activated protein kinase and  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, differential expression of multiple genes related  to the listed cell processes, and regulation of activities of other cell surface  proteins, such as vascular growth factor receptors. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid  (tetrac) is derived from T4 and competes with binding of T4 to the integrin. In  the absence of T4, tetrac and chemically modified tetrac also have anticancer  effects that culminate in altered gene transcription. Tumor xenografts are  arrested by unmodified and chemically modified tetrac. The receptor requires further characterization in terms of contributions to nonmalignant cells, such  as platelets and phagocytes. The integrin Î±vÎ²3 receptor for thyroid hormone  offers a large panel of cellular actions that are relevant to cancer biology and that may be regulated by tetrac derivatives.  ,  Context: majority of cells. Consequently, although all cells displayed linear I-V  relations in Mg(2+)-free saline, cells in which the slow EPSC was predominently  mediated by NMDA receptors exhibited voltage-dependent rectification in the  presence of external Mg2+ (1 mM). 6.

Does saracatinib promote oncogenesis?,"No, saracatinib does not promote oncogenesis. In fact, it blocks oncogenic signaling pathways in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells."," Context: saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216  and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic  signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and  NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family  member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by  treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in  saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an  EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined  treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant  cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and  5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or  in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.  ,  Context: RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Only 26% of patients had stable  disease after 8 weeks and thus proceeded to randomization. This required early  termination of the study for futility. The 70% of patients who progressed after  the lead-in phase exhibited expansion of existing lesions or decompensation due  to clinical progression without new metastatic lesions. Fatigue was reported in  more than 25% of patients (all grades) with only two patients experiencing grade  3 toxicity. Other grade 3 adverse events included dehydration, thrombocytopenia,  and weakness. CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to determine if saracatinib had potential as metastasis inhibitor. Metastasis inhibition by saracatinib may still be viable  in an earlier time in the disease history.  ,  Context: significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in  HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the  phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of  saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude  mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in  vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate  the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in  the clinic.  ,  Context: RESULTS: 21 patients were enrolled at two institutions, 12 of them with thymoma,  9 with thymic carcinoma. Thymoma patients received a median of 4.5 cycles and  thymic carcinoma patients a median of 1 cycle. There were no responses, so  accrual was halted after the first stage per protocol. 9 patients had stable  disease beyond the first assessment. Median time to progression was 5.7 months  for thymoma patients and 3.6 months for thymic carcinoma patients. Saracatinib  was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Src inhibition by saracatinib did not produce any radiographic  responses, though some patients did experience stable disease. Though negative, this study shows the feasibility of completing a trial in this rare disease, and  of accruing reasonably significant numbers of thymic carcinoma patients.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acetate works by blocking the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), which significantly reduces androgen production."," Context: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease where the previous concept of  ""hormone resistance"" has been changed by a new generation of hormonal therapies  that have proven efficacy in the castration-resistant setting. The fact is that  androgens play a crucial role in the whole clinical course of prostate cancer,  even when a patient meets castration-resistance criteria. The development of  abiraterone showed how important and clinically meaningful can be to achieve the lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression,  mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted  with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new  antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual  mechanism of action (galeterone). In this review the development of new hormonal  ,  Context: actually translated into life-prolonging options. The results of several  contemporary studies have continued to demonstrate activation of the androgen  receptor as being the key factor in the continued growth of prostate cancer.  Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome  P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: therapies. The lethal form of this disease occurs when metastatic lesions  progress in the setting of low testosterone levels, in what is conventionally  referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent insights  suggest that CRPC continues to rely on an active AR pathway for cell survival  and growth. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and  relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis  inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. EXPERT OPINION: Abiraterone acetate is an oral, well-tolerated drug that targets  a newly elucidated paradigm of continued AR activation in CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is approved in CRPC patients who have received docetaxel, and recent  data suggest that the drug will also be effective and utilized in the  pre-chemotherapy setting. Significant areas of scientific investigation remain in the optimization and further understanding of the therapy.  ,  Context:  As the first in class steroid 17Î±-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitor,  abiraterone acetate (of which the active metabolite is abiraterone) has been  shown to improve overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)--in those who are chemotherapy-naive and those previously treated  with docetaxel. Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile.

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,Waardenburg's syndrome and congenital Horner syndrome are recognized causes of congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.," Context: Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were  normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a  distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive  ""first arch syndrome"".  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context:  Reporting one case of this condition type-2 with heterochromia iridis and  cochlear deafness.

The specific place of the  gene responsibly in the chromosome-2 and the possibilities of genetic  counselling are considered.  ,  Context: Neurofibromatosis is a collective name for a group of genetic conditions in  which benign tumours affect the nervous system. Type 1 is caused by a genetic  mutation in the NF1 gene (OMIM 613113) and symptoms can vary dramatically  between individuals, even within the same family. Some people have very mild  skin changes, whereas others suffer severe medical complications. The condition  usually appears in childhood and is diagnosed if two of the following are  present: six or more cafÃ©-au-lait patches larger than 1.5 cm in diameter,  axillary or groin freckling, 2 or more Lisch nodules (small pigmented areas in  the iris of the eye), 2 or more neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas, bone dysplasia, and a first-degree family relative with Neurofibromatosis type 1. The  pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, however, half of all NF1 cases are  'sporadic' and there is no family history. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an extremely variable condition whose morbidity and mortality is largely dictated  by the occurrence of the many complications that may involve any of the body  systems. We describe a family affected by NF1 in whom genetic molecular analysis  ,  Context: PURPOSE: To present a case of iatrogenic Horner's syndrome seen together with  the heterochromia in the post-thyroidectomy period.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyronamines have been found to reduce mitochondrial O2 consumption and increase H2O2 release in rat liver mitochondria. They also exert their effects at concentrations comparable to those found in hepatic tissue, suggesting that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both  lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We  generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha  (TRalpha) gene producing a dominant-negative TRalpha mutant receptor with a  proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice  had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum  triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated  compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat  (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in  serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose  levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced  glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice.

RECENT FINDINGS: Thyroid hormones exert their effects by stimulation of thyroid  hormone receptors that have different tissue distribution and metabolic targets. TRÎ² is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol  and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TRÎ± is most important in fat, muscle, and  heart. Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics, tiromes) have been developed that  ,  Context: adipokine levels. The effects of these interventions depend on weight loss per  se, changes in fat distribution without weight loss and/or direct effects on  adipose tissue inflammation.Weight loss, as a result of diet, pharmacology and  surgery, positively influences plasma adipokines and systemic inflammation.  Several classes of drugs influence systemic inflammation directly through their  anti-inflammatory actions. PPAR-Î³ agonism positively influences adipose tissue  inflammation in several classes of intervention such as the thiazolidinediones  and perhaps salicylates, CB1-antagonists and angiotensin II receptor blockers.  Furthermore, within drug classes there are differential effects of individual pharmacologic agents on adipose tissue function.It can be concluded that several  commonly used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have  unintended influences on adipose tissue function. Improving adipose tissue function may contribute to reducing the risk of vascular diseases and the  development of type 2 diabetes.  ,  Context: The worldwide prevalence of obesity-associated pathologies, including type 2  diabetes, requires thorough investigation of mechanisms and interventions.  Recent studies have highlighted thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives as  potential agents able to counteract such pathologies. In this study, in rats  receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk daily  administration of a naturally occurring iodothyronine, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), on the gastrocnemius muscle metabolic/structural phenotype and insulin  signaling. The HFD-induced increases in muscle levels of fatty acid translocase  (3-fold; P<0.05) and TGs (2-fold, P<0.05) were prevented by T2 (each; P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation levels (â¼2.5-fold;  P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 induced these effects while sparing muscle mass and without  cardiac hypertrophy. T2 increased the muscle contents of fast/glycolytic fibers  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused intravenously with low dose (0.5 mg/kg) thyronamines. Systemic T(1)AM rapidly  increased EGP and plasma glucose, increased plasma glucagon, and corticosterone,  but failed to change plasma insulin.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the  regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated  by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to  stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GÎ²L, mSin1, protor, Protor-1, and Protor-2."," Context: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GÎ²L and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GÎ²L, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  ,  Context: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The role of the distinct mammalian target  of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes mTORC1 (mTOR-Raptor) and mTORC2 (mTOR-Rictor) in  PAVSMC proliferation and survival in PAH and their therapeutic relevance are  unknown.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed that  mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways are markedly upregulated in small remodeled pulmonary  arteries and isolated distal PAVSMCs from subjects with idiopathic PAH that have  increased ATP levels, proliferation, and survival that depend on glycolytic  metabolism. Small interfering RNA- and pharmacology-based analysis showed that  although both mTORC1 and mTORC2 contribute to proliferation, only mTORC2 is required for ATP generation and survival of idiopathic PAH PAVSMCs. mTORC2  downregulated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase, which led to  activation of mTORC1-S6 and increased proliferation, as well as a deficiency of the proapoptotic protein Bim and idiopathic PAH PAVSMC survival. NADPH oxidase 4  (Nox4) protein levels were increased in idiopathic PAH PAVSMCs, which was  necessary for mTORC2 activation, proliferation, and survival. Nox4 levels and  ,  Context:  LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in  the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase  but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased  phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since  LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and  mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be  ,  Context:  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. Several randomised controlled trials are under way to establish the place of routine screening of asymptomatic men.," Context: INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men and a major health  issue worldwide. Screening for early disease has been available for many years,  but there is still no national screening programme established in the United  Kingdom.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the latest evidence regarding prostate cancer screening and  whether it meets the necessary requirements to be established as a national  programme for all men. METHODS: Electronic databases and library catalogues were searched electronically and manual retrieval was performed. Only primary research results  were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In recent years, several important randomised controlled trials have produced varied outcomes. In Europe the largest study thus far concluded that  screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20%. On the contrary, a large  American trial found no reduction in mortality after 7-10 years follow-up. Most  ,  Context: (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life  benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques.  RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated that after reassurance their symptoms were less bothersome and easier to cope  with. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest there is a considerable gain in health by  explicitly addressing the concerns of prostate cancer in men with uncomplicated LUTS. Informing these men of their true risk of prostate cancer (before or after  a DRE and PSA estimate) may alleviate much of the bother associated with their  symptoms.

Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study  investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values.  RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents) are--3.5 ng/ml for 50 - 59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60 - 69 year olds and 6.5  ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58%, 200/346) of respondents were aware  of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20% (n = 69/346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68%, n = 234/346) used higher PSA cut-offs than  recommended by the DoH. The level of compliance showed marked regional variation  with a range from 7% to 44% (median 19%).

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. In areas with severe selenium deficiency, there is a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase within thyroid cells"," Context: been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue  and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic  myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical  articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional,  prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational  studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with  review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The  methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials  have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid  autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the  potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However,  considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for  selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise  ,  Context: hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were  subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly  by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in  the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory  activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to  determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed  autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these  diseases.  ,  Context:  In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: consequence of associated impairment of fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Thus,  individuals with genetic vitamin E deficiency and the familial  hypocholesterolemias may develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar  ataxia, and other neurologic signs and symptoms. Disease processes that damage  the enteric mucosa and produce malabsorption can trigger neurologic dysfunction  both by immune-related processes, as in celiac disease, and by impairing  absorption of essential vitamins and other nutrients, as in tropical sprue.  Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins, such as thiamine and niacin, can also  develop in the setting of malabsorption and lead to neurologic dysfunction. Neurologists are aware of the neurologic damage that copper excess can cause in  Wilson's disease, but copper deficiency due to malabsorption can also produce  neurologic dysfunction in the form of myelopathy. It is vitally important for neurologists to be aware of the potential for malabsorptive processes to produce  neurologic dysfunction, because effective treatment for such disorders is often  available.  ,  Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease.

Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene, bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel  selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal  atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and  physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral  ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo.

Ospemifene is a non-hormonal estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist effective in the treatment of VVA. Although similar  in structure to other estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists that have  antagonistic effects on the vagina, ospemifene has an estrogen-like effect on  vaginal epithelium. This review focuses on ospemifene including its  pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy and safety.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate  approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to  bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection.  ,  Context: annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.  ,  Context: CEW1, contains operons and SL2 trans-splicing. We have studied the presence of  operons and trans-splicing in Pristionchus pacificus, a species of the  Diplogastridae that has recently been developed as a satellite organism in  evolutionary developmental biology. We provide evidence that P. pacificus  contains operons and that downstream genes are trans-spliced to SL2.  Surprisingly, the one operon analyzed so far in P. pacificus is not conserved in  C. elegans, suggesting unexpected genomic plasticity.  ,  Context: The nematode C. elegans is a useful model organism for studying neuronal  development and function due to its extremely simple, well-defined nervous  system, translucence, short life cycle, and abundance of genetic tools  (WormBase. http://wormbase.org , 2018; WormBook. The C. elegans Research  Community. http://www.wormbook.org , 2018). Due to the relative ease of genetic  transformation, the majority of studies in C. elegans use transgenes (e.g., green fluorescent proteins) to assess the expression and distribution of  specific proteins. In addition, large-scale in situ hybridization studies have  described the distribution of mRNAs for thousands of genes throughout development. However, there may be qualitative and quantitative differences  between expression of transgenic markers and the endogenous protein.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: atherosclerosis in the diabetic population. Each of these pathogenic processes,  which are associated with insulin deficiency, alone or in combination with  others, may result in cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Activation of the  sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context: cardiomyopathy. After a 4 week treatment with HSYA, all abnormalities were  reversed significantly. In conclusion, diabetic cardiomyopathy was correlated  with an abnormal expression of calcium handing proteins in SR and an activated  ET-ROS (reactive oxygen species) system in the diabetic affected myocardium.  HSYA significantly improved the cardiac function and down-regulated the ET  system and ROS pathway, resulting in a reversal of the abnormalities of  expression of calcium handing proteins and the cardiac performance in diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context: Diabetes induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis and suppresses cardiac autophagy,  indicating that the interplay between autophagy and apoptotic cell death  pathways is important in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The  potential mechanism, however, remains unknown. We recently reported that  diabetes depresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, inhibits  MAPK8/JNK1-BCL2 signaling, and promotes the interaction between BECN1 and BCL2.  Concomitantly, diabetes induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis and suppresses cardiac  autophagy. Activation of AMPK directly phosphorylates MAPK8, which mediates BCL2  phosphorylation and subsequent BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, leading to restoration of cardiac autophagy, protection against cardiac apoptosis, and ultimately  improvement in cardiac structure and function. We conclude that dissociation of  BCL2 from BECN1 through activation of MAPK8-BCL2 signaling may be an important mechanism by which AMPK activation restores autophagy, protects against cardiac  apoptosis, and prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated  ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR  ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased  in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR  Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with  insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view  that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: Diabetes causes energy metabolism disturbance and may lead to cardiac  dysfunction. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) protects cardiac  function from myocardial damage. Therefore, understanding of its roles in  diabetic heart is critical for developing new therapeutics targeting ALDH2 and  mitochondrial function for diabetic hearts. This study investigated the impact  of ALDH2 deficiency on diastolic function and energy metabolism in diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced in ALDH2 knockout and wild-type mice by  streptozotocin. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography. Glucose  uptake, energy status, and metabolic profiles were used to evaluate cardiac energy metabolism.

What indication has FTY720 been approved for by the FDA?,FTY720 (Fingolimod) was approved as the first oral drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010.," Context: and has been shown to interfere with the actions of S1P and to inhibit ceramide  biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of FTY720 in  a diet-induced animal model of NAFLD (DIAMOND) that recapitulates the hallmarks  of the human disease. The oral administration of FTY720 to these mice fed a  high-fat diet and sugar water improved glucose tolerance and reduced steatosis.  In addition to decreasing liver triglycerides, FTY720 also reduced hepatic  sphingolipid levels, including ceramides, monohexosylceramides, and  sphingomyelins, particularly the C16:0 and C24:1 species, as well as S1P and  dihydro-S1P. FTY720 administration decreased diet-induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in DIAMOND mice without affecting other key enzymes in  lipogenesis. FTY720 had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c, which  transcriptionally activates FASN. However, in agreement with the notion that the active phosphorylated form of FTY720 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases,  FTY720-P accumulated in the liver, and histone H3K9 acetylation was markedly  increased in these mice. Hence, FTY720 might be useful for attenuating FASN  ,  Context:  FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. FTY720 is mainly associated with unique functional  ""antagonist"" and ""agonist"" mechanisms. The functional antagonistic mechanism is  mediated by the transient down-regulation and degradation of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, which prevents lymphocytes from entering the blood stream from the  lymph node. This subsequently results in the development of lymphopenia and  reduces lymphocytic inflammation.

METHODS: We analysed blood samples from 9 fingolimod-treated and 19 control  patients with MS by flow cytometry, to determine the frequencies and activation  states of naive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts. RESULTS: The frequencies of each B-cell population in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (PBMC) were greatly reduced 2 weeks after starting fingolimod  treatment. Detailed analysis revealed a significant reduction in activated  memory B cells (CD38(int-high)), particularly those expressing Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation. Also, we noted an increased proportion of activated  plasmablasts (CD138(+)) among whole plasmablasts, in the patients treated with  fingolimod. CONCLUSIONS: The marked reduction of Ki-67(+) memory B cells may be directly linked with the effectiveness of fingolimod in treating MS. In contrast, the  relative resistance of CD138(+) plasmablasts to fingolimod may be of relevance  for understanding the differential effectiveness of fingolimod in individual  patients.  ,  Context: study, a randomised, double-blind study that included 1272 patients with  relapsing-remitting MS who were assigned 1:1:1 to fingolimod (0Â·5 mg or 1Â·25 mg)  or placebo once daily for 24 months. Subgroups were predefined, predefined and  slightly modified, or defined post hoc, by demographic factors (including sex  and age), disease characteristics (including baseline disability scores, relapse  rates, and lesion parameters), and response to previous therapy (including  analyses in patients eligible for fingolimod treatment according to the European  label). Data were analysed by intention to treat. The FREEDOMS study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00289978. FINDINGS: Treatment with fingolimod 0Â·5 mg was associated with significantly  lower ARRs versus placebo across all subgroups except for patients aged over 40  years. ARR ratios ranged from 0Â·76 (95% CI 0Â·54-1Â·09; p=0Â·13) in patients aged over 40 years to 0Â·29 (0Â·16-0Â·52; p<0Â·0001) in patients who had relapse activity  despite receiving interferon beta during the year before study enrolment. Hazard  ratios for confirmed disability progression over 24 months with fingolimod 0Â·5  ,  Context: conditions. Fingolimod treatment subsequent to lysolecithin-induced  demyelination enhanced remyelination and process extension by OPCs and mature  oligodendrocytes, while increasing microglia numbers and immunoreactivity for  the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The number of  phagocytosing microglia was not increased by fingolimod. Using S1P receptor  specific agonists and antagonists, we determined that fingolimod-induced effects  on remyelination and astrogliosis were mediated primarily through S1P3 and S1P5,  whereas enhanced microgliosis was mediated through S1P1 and S1P5. Taken  together, these data demonstrate that fingolimod modulates multiple neuroglial cell responses, resulting in enhanced remyelination in organotypic slice  cultures that maintain the complex cellular interactions of the mammalian brain.  ,  Context: 100 mg golimumab) and 4 developed active tuberculosis.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity. It regulates various steps of transcription by RNA polymerase II and transduces signals from transcription activators"," Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context:  Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  ,  Context: although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  ,  Context: Comparative analysis reveals complete conservation of the arrangement of rRNA  gene fragments in the mt genomes of all the 23 Plasmodium species and L.  caulleryi. Surveys for a new rRNA gene fragment using hidden Markov models  enriched with recent mt genome sequences led us to suggest the mtR-26 sequence  as a novel candidate LSU rRNA fragment in the mt genomes of the 24 species.  Additionally, we found 22-25 bp-inverted repeat sequences, which may be involved  in the generation of lineage-specific mt genome arrangements after divergence  from a common ancestor of the genera Eimeria and Plasmodium/Leucocytozoon.  ,  Context: events that occurred during evolution of the phylum Chordata, including two  rounds at about the origin of the subphylum Vertebrata (R1 and R2) and one round  before the teleost radiation (R3). Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such  genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be ""novel"" are more  appropriately interpreted as ""ohnologs gone missing"", cases in which ohnologs  are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Here we  consider ohnologs present in the zebrafish genome but absent from the human  genome. Reasonable hypotheses are that lineage-specific loss of ohnologs can  play a role in establishing lineage divergence and in the origin of developmental innovations. How does the evolution of ohnologs differ from the  evolution of gene duplicates arising from other mechanisms, such as tandem  duplication or retrotransposition? To what extent do different major vertebrate lineages or different teleost lineages differ in ohnolog content? What roles do  differences in ohnolog content play in the origin of developmental mechanisms  that differ among lineages? This review explores these questions.  ,  Context: in favour of and against three options: genetic testing of the deceased victim  only; counselling of relatives before testing the victim; counselling restricted  to relatives of victims who tested positive for mutations of serious and  preventable diseases. Legal cases are mentioned that pertain to the duty of  geneticists and other physicians to warn relatives. Although the claim for a  legal duty is tenuous, recent publications and guidelines suggest that  geneticists and others involved in the multidisciplinary approach of sudden  death (SD) cases may, nevertheless, have an ethical duty to inform relatives of  SD victims. Several practical problems remain pertaining to the costs of testing, the counselling and to the need to obtain permission of judicial  authorities.

Is colistin an antibiotic?,"Colistin is a membrane-acting agent, but it is also mentioned alongside other antibiotics such as beta-lactam or cephalosporin antibiotics, tetracycline antibiotics, and fluoroquinolones."," Context: anecdotal cases mostly in adults were reported. Although tubulopathy associated  with colistin was reported in adults, to the best of our knowledge,  colistin-associated BLS neither in adults nor in children has been reported in  the literature. We here report a-28-week, 740Â g female preterm infant who  developed BLS just after colistin treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii  infection and recovered few days after the drug cessation, and discuss the  possible association of colistin and tubulopathy. More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.  ,  Context: norfloxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, ciprofloxacin), 15 beta-lactam or  cephalosporin antibiotics (cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam,  cefdinir, cefoperazone, cefpiramide, cefamandole, cefixime, ceftibuten,  cefmetazole, cephalosporin C, aztreonam, piperacillintazobactam, mezlocillin), 3  tetracycline antibiotics (meclocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline), 2  membrane-acting agents (colistin and clofoctol), and 1 protein synthesis  inhibitor (amikacin). Among them, the top 7 hits were colistin, tosufloxacin,  levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, cefmenoxime and pazufloxacin, where  clinafloxacin and pazufloxacin were the newly identified agents active against UPEC strain UTI89. We validated the key results obtained with UTI89 on two other  UTI strains CFT073 and KTE181 and found that they all had comparable MICs for  fluoroquinolones while CFT073 and KTE181 were more susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics and tetracycline antibiotics but were less susceptible to colistin  than UTI89. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide possible effective drug candidates for the more  effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.  ,  Context: Our intestinal microbiota serve many roles vital to the normal daily function of  the human gastrointestinal tract. Many probiotics are derived from our  intestinal bacteria, and have been shown to provide clinical benefit in a  variety of gastrointestinal conditions. Current evidence indicates that  probiotic effects are strain-specific, they do not act through the same  mechanisms, and nor are all probiotics indicated for the same health conditions. However, they do share several common features in that they exert  anti-inflammatory effects, they employ different strategies to antagonize  competing microorganisms, and they induce cytoprotective changes in the host either through enhancement of barrier function, or through the upregulation of  cytoprotective host proteins. In this review we focus on a few selected  probiotics - a bacterial mixture (VSL#3), a Gram-negative probiotic (E. coli  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cariprazine was approved for treating schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder, and currently is being evaluated for treating depression in clinical  trials in the United States. We systematically reviewed the literature on the  efficacy and safety of cariprazine. METHODS: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO,  EMBASE, and Cochrane collaboration databases through August 31, 2016. The search was not restricted by patient age. Articles published in English or official  English translations were included. RESULTS: Eleven articles that evaluated the use of cariprazine in the treatment of psychiatric disorders were identified. Four trials evaluated the safety and  efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder. One trial investigated its use as  an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder. Three trials  ,  Context: RESULTS: A total of eight drugs were found including those targeting the Î±4Î²1,  Î±4Î²7 or Î±EÎ²7 integrins as well as the ICAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 addressins and the  chemokine receptor 9. The rationale for these drugs is the blockade of  gut-homing T lymphocytes and the ones targeting the Î±4Î²7/MAdCAM-1 interaction  presented the most promising results in luminal disease. Vedolizumab, an Î±4Î²7  antibody, has completed phase 3 trials with very positive results especially for  ulcerative colitis. However, many questions remain unanswered such as the effect  of these therapies in perianal disease and extraintestinal manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: The blockade of the Î±4Î²7/MAdCAM-1 interaction and especially vedolizumab is an effective and safe gut-specific treatment for IBD. Further  studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of the other anti-adhesion  drugs and to define the specific indications of these therapies in the different scenarios of IBD.
