What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, specifically H3K27 methylation, plays a significant role in medulloblastoma. The upregulation of polycomb genes required for H3K27 methylation and high expression of the homeobox transcription"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors.

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned.

Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.

Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease.

AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ,  Context:  Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia  after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distribution of  Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism,  and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of  cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests that its aggregation constitutes  one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation  strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril formation.

The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening.  A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001).

We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: 34.8% and 44.4%).

With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective.

All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish.

However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep.

Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.  ,  Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection.

Which package is available for analysing genomic interactions in R/Bioconductor?,diffloop," Context: SUMMARY: The 3D architecture of DNA within the nucleus is a key determinant of  interactions between genes, regulatory elements, and transcriptional machinery.  As a result, differences in DNA looping structure are associated with variation  in gene expression and cell state. To systematically assess changes in DNA  looping architecture between samples, we introduce diffloop, an R/Bioconductor  package that provides a suite of functions for the quality control, statistical testing, annotation, and visualization of DNA loops. We demonstrate this  functionality by detecting differences between ENCODE ChIA-PET samples and  relate looping to variability in epigenetic state. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Diffloop is implemented as an R/Bioconductor  package available at  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffloop.html.

Functions producing 2D and 3D diagrams of the identified triplexes allow instant  visualization of the search results.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation."," Context:  Most RNAs generated by the human genome have no protein-coding ability and are  termed non-coding RNAs. Among these include circular RNAs, which include exonic  circular RNAs (circRNA), mainly found in the cytoplasm, and intronic RNAs (ciRNA), predominantly detected in the nucleus. The biological functions of  circular RNAs remain largely unknown, although ciRNAs have been reported to  promote gene transcription, while circRNAs may function as microRNA sponges. We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer  cells and were associated with cell cycle progression. Silencing endogenous  circ-Foxo3 promoted cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3  ,  Context: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through backsplicing. Recent methodologies have enabled in-depth  characterization of circRNAs for identification and potential functions.  CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.

They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an  increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs  are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have  been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use. A literature  search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of  bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor has been defined as a progressive cystic swelling  involving muscle which is produced by recurrent hemorrhage and accompanied by  roentgenographic evidence of bone involvement. Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia, and, therefore, we present a case of a six-year-old  male hemophiliac with a cyst in the left distal radius.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region. We report a rare case occurring in  the mandible of a 14-year-old boy who presented with considerable expansion and displacement of teeth.  ,  Context:  The haemophilic pseudotumor is defined as an encased hematoma that increases of  volume progressively by episodes of recurrent hemorrhage. It is a rare  complication of haemophilia occurring in 1-2% of patients with moderate or severe factor VIII or IX deficiency. Its more frequent location is in the long  bones of low extremities and pelvis. We report a case of a 21-year-old man with  moderate deficiency of factor VIII (19% of normal factor VIII activity) that developed a pseudotumor in the cranium. To our knowledge, this is the third case  of the cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in medical literature.  ,  Context: INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum.  CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial  hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature.  ,  Context: Giant abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is exceedingly rare, thus may bring great  challenges to the timely and proper diagnosis and treatment of clinicians. The  only definitive management is complete removal of the abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The objective of this article is to report surgical treatment and  follow-up outcomes of three unusual cases with giant abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor.We describe 3 patients with giant hemophilic pseudotumor involving the abdomen who were successfully treated with tumor resection. On presentation  to our institution, the patients all had signs of giant cystic lesions in  abdomen, and the patients' most outstanding complaints were aggravated abdominal pain. All of three patients underwent complete excision of abdominal hemophilic  pseudotumor. The patients showed adequate pain relief compared with the previous  status.Surgical resection is the most effective treatment option for patients  ","18836937, 2093257, 22677741, 16721483, 8938781, 31725667","Hemophilic Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence."," Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf).

The onset of  expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish  ,  Context: actually a number of dnmt3 isoforms present. Six different dnmt3 genes have  recently been identified in zebrafish. RESULTS: We have examined two of the dnmt3 genes in zebrafish that are located  in close proximity in the same linkage group and we find that the two genes are  more similar to each other than they are to the other zebrafish dnmt3 genes. We  have found evidence for the existence of several different splice variants and  alternative splice sites associated with one of the two genes and have examined  the relative expression of these genes/variants in a number of zebrafish  developmental stages and tissues. CONCLUSION: The similarity of the dnmt3-1 and dnmt3-2 genes suggests that they  arose due to a relatively recent gene duplication event. The presence of  alternative splice and start sites, reminiscent of what is seen with the human DNMT3s, demonstrates strong parallels between the control/function of these  genes across vertebrate species. The dynamic expression levels of these  genes/variants suggest that they may well play a role in early development and  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Zebrafish embryos are transcriptionally silent until activation of  the zygotic genome during the 10th cell cycle.

CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous  group of peripheral neuropathies. Different chromosomal loci have been linked  with three autosomal dominant, 'intermediate' types of CMT: DI-CMTA, DI-CMTB and DI-CMTC. We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2  to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia,  Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus. In  transiently transfected cell lines, mutations of DNM2 substantially diminish  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) constitutes a large group of genetically  heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Autosomal recessive  forms of CMT are less common in the general population but account for the vast majority of CMT phenotypes in communities with a high prevalence of  consanguinity. At least 10 genetic loci cause autosomal recessive forms of CMT.  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene are among the most frequent genetic causes of autosomal recessive  forms of CMT. To date, 28 mutations in GDAP1 gene have been linked with the  disease. Here, we report a novel GDAP1 mutation in an Old Order Amish family  ,  Context: Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a  demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a  submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that  contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22. Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic  phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy. Our findings show that the CMT1A phenotype of reduced NCV is specifically associated with PMP22 gene duplications, thus providing further  support for the PMP22 gene dosage mechanism for CMT1A.

The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.  ,  Context: Thyroid hormone governs a diverse repertoire of physiological functions through  receptors encoded in the receptor genes alpha and beta, which each generate  variant proteins. In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the  normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact  function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted  ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/-  mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have  inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that  the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones.  However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism,  ,  Context: expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3  stimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible  promoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter  sequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start  site. Disruption of putative TR binding sites by mutagenesis abolished the  TRalpha1- (G-1651T) and TRbeta1- (G-73T) mediated effects, indicating that  TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 response elements map to different regions of the KCND3  promoter. Thus, I(to) is modulated by diverse T3-dependent regulation of  underlying gene transcription. TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 exhibit distinct effects on KCND3 transactivation with TRalpha1 enhancing and TRbeta1 suppressing KCND3  transcription.  ,  Context: including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body  temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit  skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The  results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant  decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid  phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the  balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an  additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian  species.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rare and challenging diagnosis requiring  early treatment.

These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction. Recommended treatments for MIS-C include intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, and inotropic or vasopressor support.

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.

There are a handful of CGRP-targeted therapies currently in phase 3 studies for  migraine acute treatment or prevention. Currently, 4 monoclonal antibodies  targeting either the CGRP ligand or receptor are being studied for migraine  prevention: ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG 334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab),  and TEV-48125 (fremanezumab). Meanwhile, 1 small-molecule CGRP receptor  antagonist (ubrogepant, MK-1602) is currently in phase 3 studies for the acute  treatment of migraine. Two of these anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for cluster headache prevention as well. Several other  small-molecular CGRP receptor antagonists are in earlier stages of development  for acute migraine treatment or prevention. In this review, we will discuss the growing body of clinical trials studying CGRP-targeted therapies for migraine  and cluster headache.  ,  Context: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor  antagonist intended for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Ubrogepant has  a chemical structure distinct from previous small-molecule CGRP receptor  antagonists that were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report overall and hepatic safety data from  two placebo-controlled phase I trials of ubrogepant, spray-dried oral compressed tablet (SD-OCT) in healthy male volunteers. Trial A was a pharmacokinetic (PK)  trial of single (100-400 mg) and multiple (40-400 mg) ascending doses. Trial B  was a dedicated hepatic safety trial assessing daily use of ubrogepant 150 mg for 28 days. Serum ALT (as hepatotoxicity biomarker) and PK data are reported.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context:  The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and  ,  Context:  The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context:  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.  In 1918-1919, pandemic influenza appeared nearly simultaneously around the globe  and caused extraordinary mortality (an estimated 50-100 million deaths) associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The  descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they  cause significant mortality each year. Although the ability to predict influenza pandemics remains no better than it was a century ago, numerous scientific  advances provide an important head start in limiting severe disease and death  from both current and future influenza viruses: identification and substantial  ,  Context:  Paramyxoviridae, a large family of enveloped viruses harboring a nonsegmented  negative-sense RNA genome, include important human pathogens as measles, mumps,  respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and henipaviruses, which cause some of the deadliest emerging zoonoses. There is no effective  antiviral chemotherapy for most of these pathogens. Paramyxoviruses evolved a  sophisticated membrane-fusion machine consisting of receptor-binding proteins and the fusion F-protein, critical for virus infectivity. Herein we identify the  antiprotozoal/antimicrobial nitazoxanide as a potential anti-paramyxovirus drug  targeting the F-protein. We show that nitazoxanide and its  ,  Context: synergistic effect in combination with oseltamivir, thereby expanding influenza  treatment options. A Phase III clinical evaluation of favipiravir for influenza  therapy has been completed in Japan and two Phase II studies have been completed  in the United States. In addition to its anti-influenza activity, favipiravir  blocks the replication of many other RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin,  Machupo and Pichinde); phleboviruses (Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever and Punta  Toro); hantaviruses (Maporal, Dobrava, and Prospect Hill); flaviviruses (yellow  fever and West Nile); enteroviruses (polio- and rhinoviruses); an alphavirus,  Western equine encephalitis virus; a paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus; and noroviruses. With its unique mechanism of action and broad range of  antiviral activity, favipiravir is a promising drug candidate for influenza and  many other RNA viral diseases for which there are no approved therapies.  ,  Context: period of 8 to 11 days, initial symptoms such as fever, cough, coryza and  conjunctivitis appear. Two thirds of the patients shows a white-marked enanthema  on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots). After disappearance of these symptoms, a  second increase of temperature and the typical measles exanthema, a brownish-red  maculopapular rash, appear. Infection with measles virus induces transient  immunodeficiency that favours the formation of several complications. Some of  them, e. g. encephalitic diseases, are severe and associated with a high  mortality. Measles are world-wide distributed and belong to the ten most  frequent infectious diseases in some less developed countries. The disease is associated with a high mortality in some African and South-East Asian countries,  in particular in children aged less than 12 months. Of particular note, measles  are the most important cause of blindness in children in population with borderline vitamin A status. In Germany, the number of reported measles cases  has been declined dramatically since the introduction of a vaccine more than  four decades ago.

Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis.

Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis.

We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer  treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.  The data clearly support the validity of clinical testing of combining targeting TAMs with conventional therapy.

TAMs, exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype, are key players  in cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. A high TAM  infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: that activate surrounding immune-infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated  macrophages (TAMs).

An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,Rif1 regulates DNA replication by controlling the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the genome. It achieves this through a mechanism independent of its role in localizing telomeres to the nuclear periphery and the intra-S checkpoint signaling pathway.," Context: regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.  ,  Context: Chromosomal DNA replication involves the coordinated activity of hundreds to  thousands of replication origins. Individual replication origins are subject to  epigenetic regulation of their activity during S-phase, resulting in  differential efficiencies and timings of replication initiation during S-phase.  This regulation is thought to involve chromatin structure and organization into  timing domains with differential ability to recruit limiting replication  factors. Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of  replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells. However, previous  studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1's role in controlling replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.  ,  Context: factors.

Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase.

Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4  ,  Context:  DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions. Recently, the  function of DHX36 in the regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s) was demonstrated. G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  ,  Context: extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36  loads onto the extension and translocates 3'-5' toward the G4. DHX36 unwound  dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly,  we observed that DHX36 has striking 3'-extension sequence preferences that  differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from  differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results  indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is  tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on  the 3'-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s may not track directly with G4 stability.  ,  Context:  Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells  have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA  structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing  and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high  affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two  main G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4  affinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of  ,  Context: G-Quadruplex (G4) DNA (G4 DNA) and RNA (G4 RNA) are secondary nucleic acid  structures that have multiple roles in vital cellular processes.

Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context: 20 of histone H4 (H4-K20) and defective chromosome alignment and segregation.  Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.  ,  Context:  PR-Set7 is the sole monomethyltransferase responsible for H4K20 monomethylation  (H4K20me1) that is the substrate for further methylation by Suv4-20h1/h2.  PR-Set7 is required for proper cell cycle progression and is subject to degradation by the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the cell  cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that PR-Set7 is an important  downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2) function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity.

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The  majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating  mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel  (Bartter syndrome type III).

Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?,"No, recent reports suggest increased levels of RNA editing in squids, and it is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites."," Context: RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of  proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among  animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA  editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these  events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally  sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules  pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence  flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding  conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms  in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and  ,  Context: independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine  whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates  derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and  fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in  inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by  deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is  an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing  (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear  to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis  of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by  anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some  adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an  independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding  of their nuclear mRNAs.

However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing. Altogether, our results suggest that the  linkage landscape of A-to-I editing has evolved during metazoan evolution.

The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is  expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C  ,  Context: has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which  explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity  of DNA G + C content in bacteria. In this article, first, a theory of the  evolution of DNA G + C content is presented that is based on the equilibrium  among three components: directional mutation pressure, DNA G + C content, and  selective constraints. According to this theory, consideration of both u and v  as well as selective constraints is essential to explain the molecular evolution  of the DNA base composition and sequence. Second, the theory of directional  mutation pressure is applied to the analysis of the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in multicellular eukaryotes. The theory  explains the extensive intragenomic heterogeneity of G + C content of higher  eukaryotes primarily as the result of the intragenomic differences of directional mutation pressure and selective constraints rather than the result  of positive selections for functional advantages of the DNA G + C content  itself.  ,  Context: theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral  parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine  content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,Iodine prophylaxis aims to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes by taking iodine tablets before or shortly after their release during accidents with nuclear reactors.," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides.

The Chernobyl accident confirmed that the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer is much higher for  foetuses and children and adolescents under 18 years. An epidemiological study  showed that intake of iodine tablets could reduce the risk for thyroid cancer by a factor of three.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values.

Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of  propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a dodecameric enzyme composed of two different  proteins alpha-PCC and beta-PCC, nuclear encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes,  respectively. Mutations in either gene cause PA and to date, up to 47 different  allelic variations in the PCCB gene have been identified in different  populations. In this work, we describe the expression studies of 18 PCCB sequence changes in order to elucidate their functional consequences. We have  used a PCCB-deficient transformed fibroblast cell line to target the wild-type  and mutant proteins to their physiological situation, analysing the effect of the mutations on PCC activity and protein stability.

High-speed video-microscopy analysis (HVMA) of  ciliary beating, currently the first-line diagnostic tool for PCD in most  centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1.

Which kinase is regulating stress granule biogenesis?,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates stress granule biogenesis, specifically AMPK-α2 isoform associates with stress granules in response to various stressors."," Context:  Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by  acting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK  ,  Context: differed from those engaged in the known tRNA-based mechanism of translational  recoding, which is induced by oxidative stress. Some of the expression effects  were stress-specific, whereas others were not, thus suggesting that RNA PTMs may  perform multifaceted activities in stress response, which are subjected to  distinctive regulatory pathways. To explore their signaling networks, we  implemented a strategy based on the systematic deletion of genes that connect  established response genes with PTM biogenetic enzymes in a putative  interactomic map. The results clearly identified PTMs that were under direct HOG  control, a well-known protein kinase pathway involved in stress response in eukaryotes. Activation of this signaling pathway has been shown to result in the  stabilization of numerous mRNAs and the induction of selected lncRNAs involved  in chromatin remodeling. The fact that PTMs are capable of altering the activity of the parent RNAs suggest their possible participation in feedback mechanisms  aimed at modulating the regulatory functions of such RNAs. This tantalizing  hypothesis will be the object of future studies.  ,  Context:  Stress signals elicit a wide variety of cellular responses, many of which  converge on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 kinases, the activation of which  has been well-characterized. How these kinases are switched off by dephosphorylation is not well understood. Here we describe how diverse cellular  stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating  dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6. Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6  phosphatase. However, while anisomycin treatment of cells leads to M3/6 protein  degradation, arsenite appears to inactivate M3/6 directly.

What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,PAPOLA/PAP functions as a phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzyme required for glycerolipid biosynthesis.," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA. Mutation of the 5' proximal AUG  resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence,  whereas no significant effect was observed after mutation of the second AUG.  These observations imply that translational regulation is among the conserved  mechanisms regulating PAPOLA expression.  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The family of three lipin proteins act as phosphatidate  phosphatase (PAP) enzymes required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, and also as  transcriptional coactivators that regulate expression of lipid metabolism genes. The genes for lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3 are expressed in key metabolic  tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver, but the  physiological functions of each member of the family have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine the most recent studies that provide information  about the roles of lipin proteins in metabolism and human disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or  ,  Context: Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes.  Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the  mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where  holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is  altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1  exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context: Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes.

Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context:  Mammalian lipins (lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3) are Mg2+-dependent  phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes, which catalyze a key reaction in  glycerolipid biosynthesis. Lipin-1 also functions as a transcriptional coactivator in conjunction with members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor family. An S734L mutation in LPIN2 causes Majeed syndrome, a human  inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent osteomyelitis, fever, dyserythropoietic anemia, and cutaneous inflammation. Here we demonstrate that  mutation of the equivalent serine in mouse lipin-1 and lipin-2 to leucine or  aspartate abolishes PAP activity but does not impair lipin association with  ,  Context: induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian  target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively  regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2  functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the  high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of  lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin  family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an  example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector  proteins.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2, as it is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context: indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol  biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2  must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to  take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells  lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs.  Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a  ,  Context: Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast.

Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake.

However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells.

Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin  therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.  ,  Context: up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis  during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss. One  patient developed sinusitis secondary to the surgical procedure, which was  treated by antibiotic therapy and the patient improved clinically with no  associated implant loss. CONCLUSION: An intentional perforation of the Schneiderian membrane using a 2mm  twist drill at the time of implant placement and protrusion of the implant up to 3mm beyond the sinus floor does not alter the stability and outcome of dental  implants, one year post-restoration. This could be associated with minor  complications ranging from epistaxis to sinusitis, which are manageable. How to cite this article: Nooh N.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided  into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs,  representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic  parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model  were used to analyze the results (p < .05).  RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the  study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment,  hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus,  and mobility. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables, but not LTF gene polymorphisms, were associated  with implant loss.  ,  Context: materials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless,  membrane perforations represent the most common complication among these  procedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed  by two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018  reporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without  regenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft material. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant  placement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least  6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment. RESULTS: Eight studies provided information on the survival rate, with a global  sample of 493 implants, being the weighted mean survival rate 95.6% (IC 95%),  after 52.7 months of follow-up.

The oxytocin-like  peptides are usually less active in this respect. Among adult mammals  arginine-vasotocin is replaced by arginine-vasopressin which has much less  oxytocin activity. Thus, although arginine-vasotocin may both stimulate oviducts  and cause water retention in nonmammalian tetrapods, oxytocic and antidiuretic  functions can be regulated independently by oxytocin and vasopressin in mammals.  Arginine-vasotocin elicits vasoconstrictor responses in even the most primitive  vertebrates. These may be systemic or regional. Their distribution may determine  whether arginine-vasotocin acts as a diuretic or an antidiuretic agent. It is possible that the most primitive neurohypophyseal functions were related to  cardiovascular regulation and that the neurohypophysis acquired its  osmoregulatory functions later in vertebrate evolution.

Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"Relugolix can treat endometriosis-associated pain, uterine fibroids (UF), and prostate cancer (PCa)."," Context: monthly subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean  visual analog scale score for pelvic pain during 28 days before the end of  treatment.  RESULT(S): The mean changes in mean visual analog scale score for pelvic pain  were -3.8 mm in the placebo group; -6.2, -8.1, and -10.4 mm in the relugolix  10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg groups; respectively; and -10.6 mm in the leuprorelin  group. The major adverse events with relugolix were hot flush, metrorrhagia,  menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation, and bone mineral density decrease in a  dose-response manner, which were also observed in the leuprorelin group with a frequency comparable with that in the relugolix 40-mg group. CONCLUSION(S): Oral administration of relugolix alleviated  endometriosis-associated pain in a dose-response manner and was generally well tolerated. Relugolix 40 mg demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable with  those of leuprorelin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01458301.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign tumors common in premenopausal  women, with strong impact on the health-care systems. For many years, surgery  represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are  observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical  treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and  in ameliorating patient conditions.  AREAS COVERED: The authors review the current options available for the  treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix.  It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic  fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a  dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to  the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Relugolix is a promising drug for the non-surgical treatment of  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen  deprivation therapy (ADT) is an established treatment option to prolong survival  for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa).

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is.," Context: conformational behaviour of the d(GA)20 and d(TC)20 oligonucleotides was  analysed. Formation of d(GA)20 intramolecular duplexes is observed at any pH  value, from 8.3 to 4.6. On the other hand, intramolecular d(TC)20 duplexes are  formed only under acidic conditions. The acid d(TC)20 intramolecular duplex is  likely to be stabilized through the formation of C+C pairs, the thymine residues  remaining unpaired. The d(GA)20 oligonucleotide also forms intermolecular  duplexes which coexist with the intramolecular forms at any pH, from 8.3 to 4.6.  The structural conformation adopted by the d(TC)20 oligonucleotide at neutral pH  is uncertain. Under these conditions, this oligonucleotide shows an electrophoretic apparent molecular weight consistent with the formation of a  bimolecular complex. However, no hydrogen bonding was observed to occur under  these conditions. Implications of these results for an understanding of the molecular principles behind the conformational flexibility of alternating  d(GA.TC)n sequences are discussed. The possible biological significance of these  results is also discussed.  ,  Context: were seen at the injection sites in all children.

Often they are not suitable for immobilization on solid surfaces,  which is a common procedure in known aptamer selection methods. The  Capture-SELEX procedure allows the selection of DNA aptamers for solute targets.  A special SELEX library was constructed with the aim to immobilize this library  on magnetic beads or other surfaces. For this purpose a docking sequence was  incorporated into the random region of the library enabling hybridization to a  complementary oligo fixed on magnetic beads. Oligonucleotides of the library which exhibit high affinity to the target and a secondary structure fitting to  the target are released from the beads for binding to the target during the  aptamer selection process. The oligonucleotides of these binding complexes were amplified, purified, and immobilized via the docking sequence to the magnetic  beads as the starting point of the following selection round. Based on this  Capture-SELEX procedure, the successful DNA aptamer selection for the  ,  Context:  Cytokine storm defines a dysregulation of and an excessively exaggerated immune  response most often accompanying selected viral infections and several  autoimmune diseases.

Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately. The calcineurin- and mTOR-inhibitors are  both metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which is also involved in the  metabolism of many other drugs. The review discusses the most important interactions that in- or decreases the through level of these drugs.  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the effect of pharmacogenetics on the  antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. BACKGROUND: Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by  polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP]  family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug  (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12). METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention  in the randomized PRINC (Plavix Response in Coronary Intervention) trial had  platelet function measured using the VerifyNow P2Y12 analyzer after a 600-mg or split 1,200-mg loading dose and after a 75- or 150-mg daily maintenance dosage.  Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the  CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials.

It produces a reversible  and predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound  FXa. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral  availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours.  Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by  hepatic metabolism.

RESULTS: In the human mass balance study, mean total radioactivity recovered was  98.3% of the dose administered (53.1% and 45.2% excreted via urine and feces,  respectively). The main metabolic pathway of vericiguat is glucuronidation via  uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 and 1A1. In vitro studies  revealed a low risk of vericiguat acting as a perpetrator by inhibiting  cytochrome P450s, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms, or major  transport proteins, or by inducing cytochrome P450s. These observations were  supported by phase I drug-drug interaction studies. Phase I studies that assessed the propensity of vericiguat as a victim drug showed changes in the  range that did not warrant recommendations for dose adjustment in phase III. CONCLUSIONS: A low pharmacokinetic interaction potential of vericiguat was estimated from in vitro data and confirmed in vivo.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. It also controls cell growth and maintains a ""young cell"" phenotype. Additionally, HuR is involved in the regulation of genes enriched in AU"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context:  Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically  regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated  protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide  riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the  expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target  radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was  previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE)  elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is  recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the  complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and  translation of its ligand message. We have previously demonstrated that HuR is  constitutively expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells and shuttles from the nucleus to the cytosol, but remains predominantly nuclear in the preadipocytes and that as  the cells differentiate, there is a marked increase in the proportion of HuR in  the cytosol at any time. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is also expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein, HuR, associates with the HuR mRNA, but the consequences  of this interaction are unknown. Here, we use human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs)  and cervical carcinoma cells to study this regulatory paradigm. Ectopic overexpression of HuR potently enhanced the translation and cytoplasmic levels  of endogenous HuR, but did not affect HuR mRNA levels. Inhibition of CRM1  function by Lemptomycin B or by knockdown of CRM1 greatly diminished the cytoplasmic levels of endogenous HuR mRNA and hence blocked the induction of  endogenous HuR by exogenous HuR. Further studies showed that HuR interacted with  the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HuR and that overexpression of HuR increased  ","23223443, 19884656, 12730239, 23401122, 16639702, 20007147","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.75,[0.547 0.598 0.537 0.478 0.507 0.59 ],[0.616 0.688 0.646 0.604 0.645 0.759],0.669
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA deformation energy is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning, as it has been used to develop new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome.

Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?,"SpectralTAD is an R package developed for detecting hierarchical, biologically relevant topologically associated domains (TADs) using a sliding window-based spectral clustering framework."," Context: topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops.  Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding  genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to  biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally  inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based  spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors  for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects  hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD  outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental  settings.

In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be  split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their  ,  Context: The spatial organization of genomes is based on their hierarchical  compartmentalization in topological domains. There is growing evidence that  bacterial genomes are organized into insulated domains similar to the  Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) detected in eukaryotic cells.  Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are used to analyze in vivo  DNA proximity based on ligation of distal DNA segments crossed-linked by bridging proteins. By combining 3C and high-throughput sequencing, the Hi-C  method reveals genome-wide interactions within topological domains and global  genome structure as a whole. This chapter provides detailed guidelines for the preparation of Hi-C sequencing libraries for bacteria.  ,  Context: reads sequenced, so it is important and challenging to determine the optimal  read depth for an experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an  existing experiment. RESULTS: By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing experiment and  determining where the saturation of power and accuracy occurs, one can determine  what the most useful depth should be for future experiments, and furthermore,  confirm whether an existing experiment had sufficient depth to justify its  conclusions. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient  approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at  each depth.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a sympathetic pathway, and rodent studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone on autonomic out"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both  systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma  glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced  any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that  central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute  alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following  systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act  centrally to modulate glucose metabolism.  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of  S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly  conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516  antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently  induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and  phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events  appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1  acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.

Functional agonistic mechanisms are executed  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P) receptors mediate multiple  events including lymphocyte trafficking, cardiac function, and endothelial  barrier integrity. Stimulation of S1P1 receptors sequesters lymphocyte subsets  in peripheral lymphoid organs, preventing their trafficking to inflamed tissue  sites, modulating immunity. Targeting S1P receptors for treating autoimmune  disease has been established in clinical studies with the non-selective S1P  modulator, FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya™). The purpose of this study was to  assess RPC1063 for its therapeutic utility in autoimmune diseases. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The specificity and potency of RPC1063 (ozanimod) was evaluated for all five S1P receptors, and its effect on cell surface S1P1  receptor expression, was characterized in vitro. The oral pharmacokinetic (PK)  parameters and pharmacodynamic effects were established in rodents, and its activity in three models of autoimmune disease (experimental autoimmune  encephalitis, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis and CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T  cell adoptive transfer colitis) was assessed.  ,  Context: FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist  that exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects and was approved as the first oral  drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in 2010.

These  functions might play important roles in regulating anti-apoptotic systems,  ,  Context: tool PLIP. These patterns characterise BVDU's interaction with its target s.  Using PLIP we performed an in silico screen of all structural data currently  available and identified the FDA approved malaria drug amodiaquine as a  promising repositioning candidate. We validated our prediction by showing that  amodiaquine suppresses chemoresistance in a multiple myeloma cancer cell line by  inhibiting the chaperone function of the cancer target Hsp27. This work proves  that PLIP interaction patterns are viable tools for computational repositioning  and can provide search query information from a given drug and its target to  identify structurally unrelated candidates, including drugs approved by the FDA, with a known safety and pharmacology profile. This approach has the potential to  reduce costs and risks in drug development by predicting novel indications for  known drugs and drug candidates.  ,  Context: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care in the modern era of oncology.  Research in immunotherapy has led to important advances in the treatment of  melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies using checkpoint  inhibition. Multiple systemic immunotherapies have been approved or are  currently being investigated for the management of urothelial malignancies (1).  Five antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1--programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1--PD-L1) pathway have been approved by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of various malignancies:  pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters and plays a central role in organizing the genome around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. It also defines super enhancers, which regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.  ,  Context: correlation between radial positioning and gene density. Indeed, gene-poor  chromosomes tend to be located towards the nuclear edge, while those that are  more gene-rich are positioned more internally. These observations pose a number  of questions: first, what is the function of this global organization and,  secondly, is it representative of that occurring at a more local scale? During  the course of this review, these questions will be considered, in light of the  current literature regarding the role of transcription factories and the nuclear  matrix in interphase genome organization.  ,  Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.

Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed  countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is  still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of  multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens.  Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable  for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity.
