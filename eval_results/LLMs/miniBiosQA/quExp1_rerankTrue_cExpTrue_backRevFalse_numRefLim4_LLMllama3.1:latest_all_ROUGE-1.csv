Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF - B activity. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer.

At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals.",,0.062,[0.667 0.667 0.667 0.667],[0.106 0.106 0.065 0.065],0.333

What are the computational methods for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins?,Several computational methods exist for the identification of transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) from sequence.

Initial methods developed for the prediction of the transmembrane beta strands were based on hydrophobicity analysis, using sliding windows along the sequence, in order to capture the alternating patterns of hydrophobic-hydrophilic residues of the transmembrane strands, or using generalized secondary structure prediction methods. Other approaches included the construction of special empirical rules using amino-acid propensities and prior knowledge of the structural nature of the proteins, and the development of Neural Network-based predictors to predict the location of alpha-carbon atoms with respect to the membrane. During the last few years, other more refined methods, appeared, including: Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Radial Basis Functions, Bayesian Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Mahalanobis Discriminant Functions, Cellular Automata, N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machines. Hidden Markov Model-based methods are among the most successful in topology prediction, being able to capture the unique architecture of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Consensus methods, as well as pipelines of several related tools (e.g. subcellular localization prediciton, alpha-helical transmembrane protein prediction, signal-peptide/lipoprotein prediction) have also used for discriminating beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Recently, a number of methods for predicting more detailed structural features (e.g. surface accessibility, residue contacts, even detailed atomic 3D models) tailored to beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have been developed, based on knowledge-based potential functions, graph theoretic models, physical models and multi-tape S-attribute grammars.

Moreover, daily oral dosing of ESN364 throughout the menstrual cycle in M fascicularis lowered plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner, although nadir levels of estradiol were maintained well above menopausal levels. Nevertheless, estradiol levels during the follicular phase were sufficiently inhibited at all doses to preclude the triggering of ovulation as evidenced by the absence of the LH surge and failure of a subsequent luteal phase rise in plasma progesterone concentrations, consistent with the absence of normal cycle changes in the uterus. Apart from the point at surge, FSH levels were not altered over the course of the menstrual cycle. These effects of ESN364 were reversible upon cessation of drug treatment.  ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible. Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women.

Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd protein (transcription repair coupling factor). The B. subtilis' ability to accumulate chromosomal mutations under conditions of starvation is influenced by cell differentiation and transcriptional derepression, as well as by proteins homologous to transcription and repair factors. Under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B. subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis. A functional RecA protein is not required for adaptive mutagenesis, which seems to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage has been associated with adaptive mutagenesis. The occurrence of such mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species. Starved B. subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants. The MMR (encoded by the mutSL operon) protects B. subtilis from stationary-phase mutations. The MMR modulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic properties of MutY regulates stationary-phase mutagenesis.

This inducible system will help to generate genome-wide profiles of chromatin proteins in given cell types and tissues with no need to dissect tissues from organs or separate cells from tissues, which is achieved by using specific regulatory DNA elements and due to the high sensitivity of the method. DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) has emerged as one of the most comprehensive and versatile methods available for profiling protein-DNA interactions on a genomic scale.  Recently, a novel methylation-based tagging technique, termed DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification), has emerged as a powerful tool to decipher transcriptional networks, to study chromatin-associated proteins, and to monitor higher-order chromatin organization on a genome-wide scale. We show here that the in vivo methylation-based tagging technique DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification) can be used for studies of DNA-protein interactions or chromatin profiling in plants DamID is a powerful method used to map the genomic interaction sites of these proteins in vivo  It is based on fusing a protein of interest to Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (dam). Expression of this fusion protein in vivo leads to preferential methylation of adenines in DNA surrounding the native binding sites of the dam fusion partner. Because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) is an enzymatic technology for detecting DNA regions targeted by chromatin-associated proteins.  Overall, DamID is highly robust: while the orientation of WT Dam fusions can affect the size of the target sets, their signatures remained largely reproducible.

what is the role of MEF-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation?,The Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors regulates gene expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation.,"22850285, 20075332, 22199256, 7982978","The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. MEF2C expression initiates cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). BMP-2, a regulator of cardiac development during embryogenesis, was shown to increase PI 3-kinase activity in cardiac precursor cells, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore, expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Other studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins form a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. These findings show that MEF-2 can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.",,0.068,[0.7 0.8 0.5 0.6],[0.157 0.097 0.067 0.025],0.5

Molindone, along with other antipsychotic drugs which elicit little or no Parkinsonism, bind more loosely than dopamine to D2 receptors. Compared to the tightly bound antipsychotic drugs, the more loosely bound antipsychotics generally require higher clinical doses, require fewer days for clinical adjustment, but may dissociate from the D2 receptor more rapidly and could lead to clinical relapse somewhat earlier than that found with the traditional tightly bound antipsychotic drugs. Molindone is D2-selective in vitro and has a dual D1-D2 receptor profile in vivo. Molindone can selectively block the presynaptic DA receptors. Molindone causes a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, but has no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue. Molindone elevates Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the dorsolateral striatum. Molindone exhibits selectivity for cortical serotonin-stimulated cyclase versus dopamine-stimulated cyclase. Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine.",,0.057,[0.667 0.667 0.667 0.667],[0.16  0.162 0.149 0.109],0.333

The objectives of this phase I study were to assess the dose-limiting toxicities, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to study the pharmacokinetics of CT-011 administered once to patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. We have developed a cancer vaccine in which autologous tumor is fused with dendritic cells resulting in the presentation of tumor antigens in the context of DC-mediated costimulation. The median t1/2 of CT-011 ranged from 217 to 410 hours. The PD1/PDL1 pathway is an important element contributing to tumor-mediated immune suppression.

Strelka is a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates.

They are required for in vivo methylation of these sites, and their function is essential for maintaining epigenetic regulation","11487702, 9584105, 21830056, 17660570","Chromomethylases (CMTs), which constitute a plant-specific DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase family, are involved primarily in the maintenance of symmetrical CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and they also play a role in de novo methylation. CMTs are characterized by the presence of a chromatin-associated domain (chromodomain) inserted within the catalytic protein motifs I and IV. CMTs have likely evolved because of  the high levels of CpNpG methylation present in plant genomes relative to animal genomes. The targeting of CMT methylation is accomplished by short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways and histone methylation (H3K9, H3K27). It has been shown that transposons are in vivo targets of CMT-dependent methylation, suggesting that CMTs play a role in the plant genome surveillance. In Arabidopsis, CMTs play a key role in egg cell reprogramming and normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote by mediating transposon and euchromatin epigenetic gene silencing. In tomatoes, CMTs are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit development which suggests involvement of CMTs in the locus-specific control of methylation in the pericarp during fruit growth.",,0.11,[0.625 0.5   0.625 0.5  ],[0.204 0.068 0.106 0.127],0.75

How effective is the dentritic cells treatment on cancer?,"The effectiveness of dendritic cell treatment on cancer varies, but it has proven to be feasible and effective in some patients. However, a better understanding of how dendritic cells induce and modulate immunity is necessary to optimally exploit them in anticancer vaccines","11022098, 11022098, 16221071, 16221071","Another approach to cancer therapy takes advantage of the normal role of the dendritic cell as an immune educator. Dendritic cells grab antigens from viruses, bacteria, or other organisms and wave them at T cells to recruit their help in an initial T cell immune response. This works well against foreign cells that enter the body, but cancer cells often evade the self/non-self detection system. By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells. Because a cancer antigen alone is not enough to rally the immune troops, scientists first fuse a cytokine to a tumor antigen with the hope that this will send a strong antigenic signal. Next, they grow a patient's dendritic cells in the incubator and let them take up this fused cytokine-tumor antigen. This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells. When these special mature dendritic cells are given back to the patient, they wave their newly acquired tumor antigens at the patient's immune system, and those T cells that can respond mount an attack on the patient's cancer cells.",,0.091,[0.333 0.333 0.889 0.889],[0.159 0.16  0.3   0.3  ],0.889

Question answering is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural language questions. This accentuates the need for fast and accurate biomedical question answering systems. In this paper we introduce INDOC -- a biomedical question answering system based on novel ideas of indexing and extracting the answer to the questions posed. Increased access to information allows for more informed and empowered researchers, while information overload becomes an increasingly serious risk. INDOC displays the results in clusters to help the user arrive the most relevant set of documents quickly. Evaluation was done against the standard OHSUMED test collection.

Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC.

Bacillus spp. are inhibited by 2 µg/ml, Corynebacterium spp. by 0.04-3.1 µg/ml and Clostridium spp. by 0.39-6 µg/ml vancomycin.  Peak and trough concentrations of vancomycin should be 40 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively, to both be effective and avoid oto- or nephrotoxicity in adults. There is no ideal pattern of vancomycin dosing; vancomycin dosages must be individualized. Because vancomycin activity is primarily time-dependent, the 24-h area under the curve (AUC0-24h) divided by the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) value (AUC0-24h/MIC) is a better predictor of efficacy. In adults with MIC values less than 1 μg/ml, trough concentrations greater than 10 µg/ml result in AUC0-24h/MIC values 400 Compared with adults, neonates have a higher extracellular fluid volume and a limited renal elimination capacity resulting in different pharmacokinetics subject to maturation stage.  Infants weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. These differences alter the vancomycin dosing recommendations in these two groups of premature infants. Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is rare in neonates, even with serum peak concentrations 40 microg/mL. Vancomycin is associated with ototoxicity.

However, our analyses indicate that these MDR efflux pumps did not arise through recent mutations in genes encoding transporters that changed their substrate specificities.  Instead, such MDR pumps are encoded within the genomes of virtually all microorganisms, so these genes are present and thus need only to be activated to become problematic. Moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. Finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs).",,0.123,[0.385 0.538 0.385 0.385],[0.097 0.161 0.093 0.102],0.769

SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS.  SNORD116 is a paternally expressed box C/D snoRNA gene cluster. The mouse C/D box snoRNA MBII-85 (SNORD116) is processed into at least five shorter RNAs using processing sites near known functional elements of C/D box snoRNAs. Snord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism.

What is the role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in hematopoiesis?,"According to the provided context, LSD1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. It acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions, and","23795291, 22699452, 30344952, 24163373","LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. There is also epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b that is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore,  the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, it appears that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. Furthermore, RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 in erythroid cells. RUNX1 interacts with LSD1 and MYEF2 in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells. Finally, LSD1 also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF.",,0.041,[0.583 0.583 0.667 0.583],[0.277 0.094 0.092 0.103],0.167

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

The basic steps followed in these approaches consist of (i) all-against-all sequence comparison, (ii) detection of non-overlapping similarities of two genes/proteins (components) to a single gene/protein (composite), and optionally (iii) elimination of putative spurious hits (e.g. due to promiscuous domains) achieves via clustering based on sequence similarity and examining dense regions of the resulting graph or by querying the PFAM database. An advantage of gene fusion analysis is that functional associations can be predicted even in cases of genes of unknown function. Due to the computationally intense nature of these approaches, precompiled data of this type are often organized in specialized databases. Tools and databases developed for this purpose include (in alphabetical order): fdfBLAST, FusionDB, InPrePPI, (Integrated method for Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions), MosaicFinder, Phydbac2, PLEX, Predictome, Rosetta Stone method, STRING.",,0.01,[0.688 0.688 0.562 0.688],[0.01  0.006 0.01  0.012],0.062

In addition, reduced cathepsin-L activity may play an important role in inducing drug-induced gingival overgrowth. Furthermore, the enhanced proliferation of gingival fibroblasts observed in this disease could be caused at least partly by the effects of the drugs on the cell cycle and cyclin expression in these cells.

The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium.

One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20.

The estimated total cost in treating stress urinary incontinence was 122 billion KRW in 2006 and 59 billion KRW in 2007. The estimated total economic cost of OAB was 12.02 billion dollars in 2000, with 9.17 and 2.85 billion dollars incurred in the community and institutions, respectively. Community female and male OAB costs totaled 7.37 and 1.79 billion dollars, respectively. The estimated total cost was sensitive to the estimated prevalence of OAB; therefore, we calculated the average cost per community-dwelling person with OAB, which was 267 dollars per year. An estimated 1835628 community-dwelling women over the age of 18 years had urinary incontinence in 1998. The total annual cost of this urinary incontinence is estimated at $710.44 million, or $387 per incontinent woman, comprising $338.47 million in treatment costs and $371.97 million in personal costs. An estimated 60% of women with incontinence in 1998 were aged 40 years or over.

In addition, interventions, such as hypergravity and 5-Aza treatment, induce expression of early muscle and cardiac markers like GATA-4 in BMSCs. A subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, expressing c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, exhibit a high in vitro proliferative potential. Progeny of these implanted cells have been shown to migrate along the infarcted scar, reconstitute regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibit cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation. In another study, TGF-beta has been shown to conduct the myogenic differentiation of stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression and the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed stem cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration.

By which mechanism MutT proteins act against DNA lesions in bacteria?,The MutT proteins hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP to prevent their incorporation into nucleic acids.,"12717778, 12717778, 23354752, 11856756","MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases. The common substrate structure for the proteins of the functionally diverse Nudix superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The activities of Nudix hydrolases usually result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. MutT proteins hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. MutT proteins cleave 8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate) at the α-β position; they also cleave 8-oxo-dGTP at the β-γ phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the α-β position. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated in DNA opposite to template A. By hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP before their incorporation into DNA, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing bacteria to avoid A-to-C mutations, which are a hallmark of MutT deficiency. Thus, MutT proteins prevent oxidative DNA lesions, as part of the GO system. Oxidized nucleotides can occur when bacteria are exposed to reactive oxygen species. Also, reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization, leading to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. Moreover, the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP in mycobacteria seems to be catalysed in a two-stage mechanism, since MutT converts these oxidized nucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, and not to monophosphates.",,0.061,[0.636 0.636 0.455 0.364],[0.052 0.053 0.124 0.099],0.182

NGS is introduced to an increasing number of mutation screening applications. An NGS based mutation screening procedure allowing the detection of inherited Alu insertions within any predefined sequence was used for the case of c.1739_1740insAlu in BRCA1 and c.156_157insAlu in BRCA2. Another NGS study screened BRCA1 and BRCA2 resulting in  overall sensitivity for SOLiD and PGM of 97.8% (95% CI = 94.7 to 100.0) and 98.9% (95% CI = 96.8 to 100.0) respectively. The specificity for the SOLiD platform was high, at 100.0% (95% CI = 99.3 to 100.0). PGM correctly identified all 3 indels, but 68 false-positive indels were also called. Genes known to cause deafness were sequenced by the Illumina NGS platform. Results demonstrated that targeted exons captured by our approach achieved specificity, multiplexicity, uniformity, and depth of coverage suitable for accurate sequencing applications by the NGS systems. Reliable genotype calls for various homozygous and heterozygous mutations were achieved. In the context of von Willebrand disease 43 mutations, including 36 substitutions, 2 intronic splice site mutations, 2 indels, and 3 deletions were screened on the next-generation sequencing instrument. This demonstrated that at least 350 patients and relatives per run can be simultaneously analyzed in a fast, inexpensive manner. The Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in three key genes namely COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5, each of which consists of approximately 50 exons, thus rendering mutations screening a highly time consuming and expensive endeavor. NGS is now being established for the simultaneous, fast and cost-effective detection of all possible variants in these three genes. NGS has also been used screening EGFR, KRAS and BRAF for mutations associated with cancer diagnosis and/or response to several anticancer therapies.

Ada functions in DNA repair by direct dealkylation of alkylated DNA lesions, such as the toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic O6-alkylguanine (O6-AlkG) and O4-alkylthymine (O4-AlkT) which are restored to guanine and thymine. Ada accepts stoichiometrically the alkyl group from O6-alkylguanine in DNA at the Cys-321 residue and from alkyl phosphotriester at the Cys-69 residue. When methylated at Cys-69, Ada becomes a transcriptional activator of the genes in the ada regulon, including its own. The ada gene controls the inducible resistance to alkylation mutagenesis and killing (the adaptive response). Ada alkyltransferase (ATase) is induced by exposure to low doses of methylating agents. During exponential growth, Ada removes lesions responsible for G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to C:G transversions, while in stationary populations it removes lesions causing G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions, and G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions.
